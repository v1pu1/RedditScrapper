1,Ravan had 9+1 heads
2,Ab hoga dangal comment section mei
3,Smartest dank memer
4,"If you think the world didn't count numbers before the invention of zero, you are wrong. 

Number systems existed all across the world in egypt, in ME, in India and many civilisations. Even the concept of Zero or nothingness existed. I mean that is just 50 IQ logic. 

Aryabhatta invented the mathematical application of zero. Not zero itself."
5,"If newton invented gravity in 1600s, we're people flying before that?"
6,Ab ye mat puchna ke Newton ke pehle Gravity exist karti the ya nahi!
7,Always remember u count from 1 and measure from 0.
8,"Shayad aryabhatt ne 0 invent nhi discover kia tha 

And if ju don't know

There's a difference between invention and discovery"
9,"Funfact: Romans Had Letters that equated to 100, 50, 500, 1000 and So On.....

Ten always Existed..... It was a Value not a Symbol back in the day.... All Values Existed and all knew them but there was no symbolic Sequence to them...V Meant 5, C Meant 100 and So on...There was no proper nomenclature...Aryabhatta Gave Symbol to nothingness and that became Zero which formed the starting for a Sequence to Number System.... Invention of Zero gave Rise to both the binary and decimal systems as of Today...."
10,"Good meme, but kisiko reality mei ye lagra ho to bhai ginti to hamesha se hi karte hain, agar kisi pe 11 bacche honge to uski ginti to karenge hi. 0 se bas infinite number tak ki calculation solve ho gayi for ex - 0,10,100,1000...

 Warna har number ko likhne ka alag symbol hota."
11,"Sunya was there
He just created 0 and started the number count from  0 to 10
Before it was just Dashmi therefore Giving Ravan 10 head from the name Dashanan = dashmukh ü§∑"
12,mujhe kya.mein to atheist hun üíÄ
13,"Earlier the vase was 12, and counting was done by the segments of fingers IIRC.

Discovery of zero really means proving of results of multiplication and division of numbers containing zero I think.

Good thought experiment through meme"
14,That time we had another languages and counting system which enabled it.
15,Number can't be counted without zero?? Ever heard of Roman number system......Zero just makes it simple
16,vo ram ji the unhe zero ke founding se phele hi zero ka pta tha
17,"Aryabhatta didn't invent zero

The concept of zero as nothingness was always there

He just gave a notion of it"
18,"Ramayana was written by Valmiki Ji around 5th Century during Gupta period. And Aryabhatta invented ""0"" before that in 4th Century.

I am not justifying it but if we stick to this logic it makes sense."
19,Unpopular opinion: Because it‚Äôs a fictional story that was written after Aryabhatta invented zero but the story was set in time before invention of zero.
20,Why Aryabhata discovered how many bitches I got
21,Bhai gravity invent hone se pehle bhi to log girte the na wese hi jab 0 ka aavishkaar nhi hua tha tab bhi log ginti gina krte the sanskrit me obsly
22,"Us time sanskriti chalti thi lamde. And Vo Yug Alag Tha.

Shunya ko Kisi Aur symbol se jana jata tha pehle"
23,"Chutiye 0 aur 10 maikuch differnce hota hai.

0 is a number which comes before 1.

To mai 1 aur tu zero"
24,"Maybe they know it as ""1 more than 9"""
25,"There was no concept of 'zero' 
For example Ravan has 10 heads but everyone has a head-wait nvmüíÄ"
26,"Comment section padhne ke baad me mujhe pata chala covid ne wakai bachi kuchi buddhi bhrasht kardi hai bacho ko , baseless justification chalu hai vai......."
27,"ye sab fictional hain ramayana ,mahabharata like avengers etc"
28,Ramyana is fictional /s
29,Bhaago bc right wing waale aagye!
30,pura comment section satire nahi samajhta aur fir apne aap ko dank bulata hai
31,meri sanskrit kitaab mai toh likha tha wo decimal khoje the
32,"1, 1 krke  
just to explain, like roman numerals was/is a thing.............. we don't have zero, rather they call 10 with a different alphabet and so on with 10's multiples  
and after zero was invented, complex number calculation became so easy that everyone instantly adopted it, didn't gave credit to aryabhatt anywhere, and living peacefully !!"
33,"Zero wasn't discovered by h, zero was found in an oldest book whose author was him"
34,I bet and probably ek hi sentence mein
35,"Arre choti bachi ho kya?
Samaj nahi aata?"
36,0 ki khoj aryabhatta se pehle ho chuki thi.
37,How can he discover zero do we have any lore
38,Dank memers explaining memes. Mhmm.
39,Ye OP to muh chupata fir rha h ab
40,"Kyuki dimagdaar .. English wale numbers bad me aaye the..
Pehle Hindi/Sanskrit wale numbers hi thi..Hindi ke numbers me zero nhi h..alag type ke symbols h."
41,Bsdk crop to karleta shi se
42,Bhai screenshot crop to kar leta kam se kam
43,Ramayana was written after Zero. that is why.
44,11 se ek kam the
45,"Dekh kar bada dukh hota hai ki Indians ko apni Counting he nahe pata
Ye angrez jhadu billion trillion pe ruk jate the vaha hamari asli counting start hoti thi
Phele 10 saar nahe Dashanan kehte the Ravan ko."
46,He had X heads
47,"They could have used tally marks to count
...
Oh...
Other ancient people could have added a line to increase the masala that ravan had 2 heads so on and so fourth?"
48,All I see is pissed Hindus
49,We had number system even before Aryabhatta we use to memorize them in mantras for eg you have heard the distance between sun and earth in Hanuman Chalisa like that information was stored
50,Then how did they know that Bhishma pitamah got laid 0 times
51,Mujhe kya mai toh naastik hu
52,r /croppingishard
53,Counting numbers can be counted using physical objects like fingers.
54,Who told he was born before ramayan
55,Ayyo 10 countable bruh what u taking about
56,THAT is the flaw in the whole story
57,Because ye sab myth hai üíÄ no real god
58,"ITS my guess but maybe maybe

they count them via their hands 

cause hand also have 10 fingers and lankesh adhipati ravan also have 10 head"
59,BCZ BHOSDIKE....COUNTING 1 SE START HOTI H ........CHUTIYA OP
60,"0 likkh nahi jata tha iska matlab ye nahi concept hi nahi tha. 

Good meme tho."
61,Same way they knew they had 10 fingers and aryabhatta didn't found zero he defined zero. Just like there are a lot of things that we know about but don't really understand them.
62,gaiz isliye kehte he bikini religion is the only religion
63,"Aryabhatta don't discover zero.
Zero exit in ancient time but in another term is used instead of zero...
Aryabhatta just gives the term zero
Just like Newton. Newton gives the term gravity
But it's don't means gravity isn't exists before Newton...."
64,"Value of 10 or 100 or thousand had a special word 

Zero wasn't used in operations or as a single value

Aryabhatta and other experts brought zero into use"
65,Because Ramayana is a fictional book
66,"Well to be honest arya Bhatta invented 0 of number line and already people counted the number in words,and no need to fight for this bcs,we don't have to argue on this"
67,9+1
68,Time travel
69,"Ramayan me bhagwaan thhe..
Haan Yr.. hu mai kattar sanatani"
70,Probably used Roman numbers to count
71,"Aryabhatta invented 0 aka value of nothingness, but that doesn't mean that the number '10' didn't have its value. It only was the number '0' individually which didn't have a value. Idk if make sense"
72,Actually he had 12 round off karke 10 bana diye
73,‡§≤‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç
74,Ravan had x heads
75,"So Newton ke gravity invent karne se pehle chize zamin par kaise girti thi 

Nice question tho- maybe some other numeric system at that time we don't even know if it ever happened or it's actually going to happen"
76,"Zero nahi tha, lekin english bhi thodi bani thi, ‡§¶‡§∏ bolkar khatam kardiye baat ko"
77,"Lmao, you don't understand numbers. I could just say Ravan had ten heads... I don't need zero. Numbers originated from counting.

In my 'number system' unity is represented by 'a', next largest integer by 'b' then by 'c' and so on. 

See, I don't need zero, it's just that someday we will run out of symbols for every number and we will have to do something about it. 

There comes zero.. we will represent 'nothing' by 0. Then we will write numbers as string of symbols.... and interpret them this way."
78,You just went full retard OP
79,0 is intended by Brahma Gupta
80,No use i m high
81,they called it onety one in ancient times
82,"Ramayana and mahabharata were compiled later in 300 AD during Gupta rule .  Coincidentally,  aryabhata  also invented zero during the same time . So that's why"
83,Sir roman numerals mai bhi 10 hai (X) but unke paas zero nhi tha ab uska matlab ye toh nhi ki woh logg 9 ke baad jayenge hi nhi.
84,Op lodu hai
85,**SUPNAKHA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT**
86,Ravan has X heads calculate the velocity of the arrow which was shot by Lord ram
87,Okay
88,Abe chutiye dankers kyunki Ramadan ke time pe log sirf verbally 10 BOLTE tthhe written existence of zero was not there motherfuckers
89,0 kya hai...... Mai know hu.......
90,Bhai zero Kalyug mein invent kiya h aryabhatta ne or Ramayan satyug me hui thi
91,[deleted]
92,Yeh toh anti-hindu hua na vai? Boycott karna padega na vai. Ab toh kattar Hindu Sher jaag gaye
93,Stupid RAVAN k 10 heads nhi the uske pass 10 sar itna tez dimag tha
94,Yahi to samsya hai......... Jin logo ne ramnayan ko translate kia wo bhaut bade............... Anyways......Rawan ke 10 sar nahi the... Rawan ko 10 dishao( 10 direction) ka gyan tha
