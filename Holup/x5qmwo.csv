10,"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

Marcus Aurelius"
11,So why did Jesus made people drink wine?
12,Does this mean gays can get in line now?
13,"Hell seems to have my crowd then, gon eat some pork back ribs"

15,At least I'll get to hang out with my homies in hell
16,"Glad I am none of those haha, although I mean bacon is pretty good"
17,"You don't, just enjoy your tattoo's and pork."
18,"I'm 6'2"". Don't worry lad, I'll get you a stretching rack at some point. Eyes are up here though mate. Stop staring at my knees"
19,‚ÄúToo short? Get rekt.‚Äù
20,Wear your fanciest pumps bro.
21,Jesus making water into wine: *holy laughter*
22,It's true
23,"So...no whine in Church anymore or are just all going to hell? Either way, Im fine with it"
24,Damn even god only like 6‚Äô2 and higher
25,I already knew I wasn't going to heaven
26,"Wait, so my tall, non drinking, vegetarian, tattoo free ass will get into Heaven? Aw man, all this time I was expecting to go to hell cause of the whole gay thing. There goes my plans!"
27,Heaven has the lamest people. I‚Äôd bet Hell is just a party of some cool af people kickin‚Äô it. For eternity.

36,"Man fuck it, I‚Äôm already an imp in this shitty hell"
37,Short-mindedness
38,Might be able to get some leg-extension surgery while you're waiting around in hell
39,What if you eat a pig that has eaten another pig? You would be punishing a sinner and should be allowed in heaven.
40,*screams in short*
41,If god made everyone then why the hell did he purposely make me short so I wouldn‚Äôt get to heaven? This whole things rigged!
42,Disable height limit
43,Looks like i'm going to hell
44,Well if you ‚Äúgot rid‚Äù of everyone taller than you you wouldn‚Äôt be short by comparison. If you go through with that you might be kept out of heaven for different reasons though.
45,I‚Äôll burn in hell then.
46,I thought Jesus could turn his blood into wine though.
47,"Well fuck, im danish and short"
48,Jesus drank alcohol..
49,If you listen carefully you can still hear Luke Correia screaming in the distance
50,Does that mean that children automatically go to hell?
51,so nobody in Vatican will go to heaven? Jesus didn‚Äôt go to heaven? Brits don‚Äôt go to heaven?
52,It‚Äôs common knowledge that god hates dwarfs
53,My 5‚Äô9 full sleeved ass sitting here drinking a beer eating a bacon sandwich‚Ä¶.. whattttt
54,"The logic I see is due to the fact that there probably isn't such a place, Google would basically say that noone would get in- tall, short, chunky, skinny. It's all the same because getting in isn't achievable. At least that's how it would work in my fantasy. If you're created in gods image and he establishes everything, including your flaws; it's pretty messed up he gives you those flaws- judges you for the flaws he gave you and then sends you to hell. Kind of a crappy deal."
55,"Well I check them all, good thing heaven is a fairy tale!"
56,"Shit, I baste my pork in apple cider. I‚Äôm fucked."
57,Didn't Jesus literally give people wine saying it was his blood?
58,"As an atheist, technically I believe this is true."
59,"Wait people that each to much pork.... is one pork chop to much? Is carnittas from Miguel down at the corner taco spot, you know the one with the cute sister that is really his wife, she has real pretty eyes and works the register and flirts so you buy a few extra tacos and you do because you hope to eat her taco. Any way he makes the really good carnitas and you can eat 4 tacos easily and 6 when you are hungry so is 4 to many or can you have the 6 but not the 7? I need to consult a priest but I'm not getting on my knees so we have to talk around that filthy water in the front lol..."
60,Just grow your legs you heathen smh my head
61,Wasn‚Äôt jesus blood wine ?
62,"God thanks im tall man without tattoes, who eats a bit of pork and consume alcohol"
63,"Thak god its fake as im a pork eating, tatooed and short alcoholic (also called a dwarf)"
64,What if they're referring to dick size? Short dick alcoholic pork eaters go straight to hell. Do not pass go. Yadda yadda...
65,"I‚Äôm not sure that Christian heaven thing sounds like a good idea. I‚Äôll pass and use my Viking religion, the halls of Freya would be my choice"
66,"This is such a bullshit list. The pastor gives u alcohol in church lmao. The Islamic Koran forbids alcohol, the church doesnt."
67,"Short people can enter Heaven. In the Book Of Luke in the Bible there is a story of of a tax collector that was so short he had to climb up a tree to see Jesus as he walked by. Jesus told him, Zacchaeus come down from that tree and let‚Äôs talk. Story goes on how Zacchaeus decided to turn his life around and Jesus says that ‚Äúsalvation has come to this house‚Äù. Proof that short people Biblically can get to Heaven. I‚Äôm not saying ALL short people get to Heaven but being short doesn‚Äôt stop you."

84,"Nobody goes to heaven

85,Heaven doesn't sound like much fun.
86,Which religion is this?
87,"Damn that's so unfairüòî. Like come on, how am I supposed to control how much pork I consumeü§¨. This is a true injustice smh."
