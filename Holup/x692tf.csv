1,"English was one of my majors at Uni, and classes were always like that. Me and another dude with like 20 girls. 

I also had a job where it was me with like 15 women in one open space room.

I just had to unplug my ears for an hour every so often and I was already up-to-date on where the nail polish and the bikinis were on sale and where to buy what, lol"
2,"what should you do? nothing, go to class and keep living your life"

12,"Unless you're really handsome and single, a environment like this will have more disadvantages than advantages."
13,Awww honey come here we want to practice our makeup on you! \*evil grin\*
14,"Instructions unclear, got the professor pregnant."
15,"why would it have advantages if you're handsome and single? It's just business right, and it doesn't mix too well with pleasure"
16,Okay now do the rest
17,"Talking about the university classes, not the job. University is more pleasure than business"

19,Sure but I don't see how being handsome and single helps getting better grades
