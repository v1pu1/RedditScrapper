1,Naaa I saw drac and he said he hasn’t see one yet.
2,All I heard about Romania is that Andrew Tate moved there to be a sexual deviant. I feel bad for the women there.
3,Romanian here can confirm
4,"As a romanian myself , i can confirm this information."
5,No vampires… just immortals
6,![gif](giphy|bC9czlgCMtw4cj8RgH|downsized)
7,Finally this stereotype because I've seen the one about stealing 100000000 times and it's such a bad shitposting that got popular..in spite of Romania having a very low theft and robbery rate.. but hey what's retarded x funny goes around all over the internet overnight while the truth barely started to move.
8,I know that there are no vampires. I know.
9,My country is black magic and fr For th 34 times I have turned myself fourteen I have the right to say that is false.Yes we draw funny things and do wierd shit like eating the ears of a woman who has been fed the husbands testicles but that is just cultural
10,Highlanders? Awesome reply btw
11,what are vampires?
12,Not unless we use the old ways of Vlad the Impaler. He better prepare his butt hole.
13,"actually his arguments are retarded and I feel bad for people who believe shit on the internet without checking it out..hey Andrew said it so it has to be true;

the fact is that Romania's laws aren't more corrupted; we are actually a country of orthodox people mostly ;and the crime, theft , stealing, rape and divorce rates are pretty low in comparison to the western europe which has some of them 10 times higher - check them out;

as for Tate he is just another rich fucktard with an inflated ego, he wouldn't be the only one lol..
all the countries in the world have these people;
it's just that he is way more popular because he says far-fetched stuff and then pays people to promote it with memes over his discord Ponzi Scheme ..this is genuinely what it is;

look at his ego, he made a video while a woman was massaging his back for hours..it reeks as egotism man. And so many zealots love that.
it's pathetic how easily deceivable people are; Instead of looking for the real Money (mon-eye - mono eye - aka knowledge) people look for useless ego-inflating wealth and have wet dreams of it"
14,Do you eat Shumpka?
