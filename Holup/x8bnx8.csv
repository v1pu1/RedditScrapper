1,I read news only from legitimate sources like reddit. Trustmebro is a time tested oath to legitimacy.
2,"That's actually Didier raoult, a French antivaxx doctor who might have been the first to tout chloroquine as a treatment and conducted illegal trials on his patients during the pandemic."
3,"I find that very offensive that you would call them potatoes. Potatoes are very delicious and can be made into many different dishes and are quite wonderful. These people on the other hand are none of these things, quite the opposite."
4,***...... How did he know what I was doing to my Potato?***
5,Oh this is dr raoult
6,"Fun Fact this dude is a french doctor called Didier Raoult, he used to ""treat"" people with unothorized (and unefficient) methods and the hospital he was the director of is now being investigated for a bunch of malpractices going back dozens of years"
7,I guess I believe reddit memes from now on
8,"Neither is fox, cnn, msnbc, etc. etc"
9,"But he could have, and that's scary.
/S for the dummies"
10,Only God can vax me.
11,"Hey fuck you, donâ€™t call me a potato you cucumber"
12,It was Bigfoot
13,Reddit is a news source. Sometimes
14,bon vieu raoult
15,Laughs in Phili D
16,"Actually,  [at a TED talk in 2015...](https://youtu.be/6Af6b_wyiwI)"
17,So OJ ready did it?!...
18,I get my news from memes
19,YouTube is prolly one of the best news sources XD
20,I get my news from mainstream sources like CNN why am I always wrong
21,Wait isn't that Dr Raoult ? This dude's an antivaxx jackass who tried to make French people believe his bs during the quarantine
22,Josef Mengele huge W
23,"lol crop the bottom and it works, even less time needed to make it"
24,"Doing the lord's work OP, keep it up"
25,But this is Reddit.
26,I feel personally attacked
27,"It's ""couch potato"" to you!"
28,Post this to r/conspiracy shit back and read all the unhinged comments... ðŸ˜‚
29,Honestly it could still have been made by human hand for reasons unknown. What people donâ€™t understand however is that the cause doesnâ€™t change the consequences. Like do you stop wearing masks because itâ€™s made to kill you? Doesnâ€™t really make sense
30,"Tell that to the democrats, republicans and 98% of the people on social media."
31,I *KNEW* IT!!!
32,Gigachads trust no source
33,How dare you call me a fucking potato! That's MISS fucking potato to you!

38,I'm offended I get my new from OnlyFans
39,Spud you!
40,I don't like gay upvote of r/holup
41,Raoult is an eminent infectious disease researcher with nearly 1000 publications.  He knows his stuff.  He is definitely a maverick and free thinker.  Scientists do not have to be bland sheep.
42,Neither is the news tho
43,I trust you bro!
44,I don't read news and am an uncultured swine. But at least I know I'm uncultured so I'm probably better than half the people on the internet.
45,I trust you bro B-)
46,"The guy who made the meme thought he was proving a point, but given that it is actually Dr. Raoult, itâ€™s highly probable that he did tell people that governments were going to use something like Covid as a bio weapon even before Covid happened. The only error would be that heâ€™s  French and not Swedish.

Ah Raoult"
47,Ironic the name Josef Mengele was used for him
48,"Wasnâ€™t it found that chloroquine worked, but is also highly toxic? ðŸ¤” itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve had the discussion idr the facts regarding it."
49,*Hannibal Lecter enters the chat*
50,Exactly
51,"BBC sometimes, I mean, they did warn the argentinians of the british invasion"
52,"Yeah, all of those get repeatedly exposed for using unreliable sources and having to post retractions. /s

One of those is not like the others."
53,Let the Holy Spirit penetrate you
54,In bro we trust.
55,I'm probably more of an uncultured swine than you. Guess that makes me better than 3/4th the people on the internet. Beat that!
56,Samsagace enter the chat
57,The secular world leaves me empty; Jesus come and fill my hole.
58,I am god. Give me money. I need money. (Trust me bro no cap)
59,Take my money god!
