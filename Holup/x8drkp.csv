6,"Fun fact, [this joke is almost 1800 years old:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence)

> As a deacon in Rome, Lawrence was responsible for the material goods of the Church and the distribution of alms to the poor. Ambrose of Milan relates that when the treasures of the Church were demanded of Lawrence by the prefect of Rome, he brought forward the poor, to whom he had distributed the treasure as alms. ""Behold in these poor persons the treasures which I promised to show you; to which I will add pearls and precious stones, those widows and consecrated virgins, which are the Church's crown."" The prefect was so angry that he had a great gridiron prepared with hot coals beneath it and had Lawrence placed on it, hence Lawrence's association with the gridiron. After the martyr had suffered pain for a long time, the legend concludes, he cheerfully declared: **""I'm well done on this side. Turn me over!""** From this St. Lawrence derives his patronage of cooks, chefs, and comedians."

39,"The portrayal of indigenous people as 'savage' cannibals is an untrue and race based stereotype, making this a racist comic. Racist portrayals of indigenous people are common and often overlooked; I just want to make sure I name it when I see it.
