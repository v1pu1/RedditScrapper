1,"Guys, I... I think he's from China"
2,Ladies and gentlemen.... we got him
3,"Saying that Tianamen Square happened also works, and supposedly is a monitored phrase on their Internet, so it could get the guy in trouble lol"
4,"""Your foster parents are dead"" vibes"
5,Mention Tiananmen Square 1989- CCP will literally shut down their internet completely. It’s how the Japanese deal with Chinese scammers.
6,I like this.
7,That was easy
8,Ho Lee Fuk!
9,He gave himself away.
10,"Alas, the Chilling was taken from the Bing."
11,"Damn, My guy is totally from the country china"
12,Busted
13,Is that an eastern response?
14,"Boys I think we did it, we found the Chinese Guy."
15,Actual facts
16,[removed]
17,"""I always wanted to visit Japan, it seems like a nice country"""
18,"I love how I knew about the tianman massacre event internet ban thing and saw it like at the second comment on this post, so my mind went like: 

Welp, any Chinese will be instantly kicked if they open this post xD"
19,You just say those words and you know their Chinese
20,"Damn, I thought about doing that the other day but didn't have the heart to ruin the scammer's day considering he was already living a miserable existence."
21,Why is it always a Western pig? It’s not like the East doesn’t have pigs.
22,"No de jure independence.

Not a Country.

It’s literally going to take a war, sadly."
23,"lol this shit's so fake and you guys are stupid for thinking this is real. ""western pig"" as an insult is not actually used by Chinese people."
24,I no from china. I FROM PEEPOUS  REPUBURIC OFFUH CHAINA! ZHEA ISSUH DIIFERENSE!
25,"I dunno. He might be from that country, Taiwan."
26,"I have only heard of West Taiwan, what's china?"
27,Forced to save that.
28,Clearly
29,*applause*
30,"Just have a paragraph about the uyghur genocide, and Tianamin massacre saved on your phone. No Chinese scammer will dar contact you."
31,"Not really. If he is messaging the guy from a social network, it is probably facebook or reddit or something like that. All blocked here in China. So they use a vpn. Most of the times the chinese government can't censor people using vpns."
32,oh sweet the former soviet union is still around specifically to censor chinese
33,lol people really believe this?
34,West Taiwan
35,Stop asian hate
36,De facto is the only thing that counts. De jure is a layer of word manipulation that by definition is a step away from reality.
37,"闭嘴,你这个西方猪 🐷"
38,I think you mean West Taiwan
39,-10000 social credits
40,East Taiwan
41,you mean the chinese city taiwan?
42,County*
43,They’re what west taiwan insists on being called
44,*Ching Cheng Hanji intensifies*
45,"it works best if you get them to add you on WeChat, and reply them there in chinese:

六四天安门大屠杀事件, 维吾尔种族灭绝, 新疆独立, 台湾国独立, 习维尼

doesn’t have to be their real wechat account, just a device they’re using."
46,If it works for Japan it works for me.
47,"VPN’s arent the magical thing people think they are, and Chinese people caught using VPN’s can get in trouble (Uyghurs are sentenced for years for being “terrorists” for using vpn’s).

If your ISP wants, they can tell the gov’t about your VPN use, and I imagine that chinese ISP’s are somehow worse than fking AT&T and Verizon, and Comcast. 

Also, also, the VPN you use has access to all your data, so they can sell it to marketers or a gov’t, if they please. So make sure you pick a good one. (A medium sized company, not too small and not too big.)

Ex: VPN’s were threatened to block certain pirating sites a couple of months back, and some abided, some didn’t."
48,Too many C’s :skull:
49,"We’re talking China here, that’s why i chose de jure.

It will literally take a war for Taiwan to be independent from China."
50,"just a heads-up, 西边猪 more specifically means ""a pig on the west"", which is just *slightly* different from ""Western pig"" for it to sound jarring."
51,"西方豬 is more close to the meaning (western pig)
西邊豬 is more of a pig at the west 

It looks very similar in English, but the one is much more insulting (and commonly used)"
52,"No. Taiwan is Taiwan, China is China. China is not
Taiwans problem. Leave Taiwan alone."
53,Rice = bad
54,"Taiwan is in the east of West Taiwan, East Taiwan twice removed would be what we call Japan."
55,Far East taiwan
56,Just replying to comment so can find later
57,"As a Chinese, allow me to proudly add 三年饥荒(under Chairman Mao’s genius plan 30 million ppl starved to death in 1958-1960), 百日无孩(Forcing every pregnant women to have abortion within 100 days, even if they’re expecting ), 十年大健身(during 10 years ‘culture revolution’ there’s literally no education and if you have knowledge you’ll get fuckin killed, people fight each other for 10 years so now they sarcastically calling the days ‘physical training years’), 修宪 (President of the PRC, Xi Jinping, changed the constitution to ensure he can stay in his position forever), 小学博士(President Xi only graduated elementary school, people have to put pronunciation note on the speech teleprompter— and he still stupidly makes shit loads of mistakes).
I can go on forever, *no one knows how to insult the PRC better than I do.*"
58,"Thank you sir, I shall use this in my next League session."
59,What does it mean?
60,"Their internet doesn't get shutdown. 

At best the message is deleted, at worst they get fined. 

And like OP said, if it's on a website already blocked in China, they use a VPN which is not affected by the censorship"
61,To be independent de jure. They're already independent de facto
62,"Eh, i tried going 美国猪 and it sounds like only america is western so i did that"
63,"TIL, i mostly use chinese to communicate with my family and community, not to insult others over the web"
64,"So, does reddit warn you when someone edits their post?"
65,legendary. respect 🙏
66,"I think you would probably improve the discussions in subs like /r/EnoughWumaoSpam and /r/ADVChina. The discussions are ok now, but it's always better with commentary from people who have firsthand experience."
67,"1. Tian An Men Square massacre 
2. Extinction of some tribe i dont know
3. Independence of Xin Jiang
4. Independence of Taiwan
5. Winne Xi"
68,Why only use it the wrong way?
69,![gif](giphy|3o7TKHKjrDyqphX9Cg)
70,No
71,yes. and #2 is the genocide of Uyghurs
72,"Can Inner Mongolia get some love?

They’ve been culturally genocided as well. Not to the same extent because they’re not turkic muslims, but still pretty much land stolen and culture erased, locked in place under torrid conditions."
73,Cuz i use english when insulting
74,Same with Tibet however both Mongolia and  Tibet have seen a ramp up of DNA collections and further restrictions lately
75,"Yeah, saw that. Fking taking kids’ blood is just so wrong. 

Forget any political assertions, just the basic, emotional response is “this is wrong”. 

I can’t imagine getting a notice that I HAVE to take my 3 or 5 year old to some location to have their blood drawn and DNA stored by the gov’t."
