My/our grandparents were NOT doomed to become fat just because they got old.

I mean, guy is in my opinion one of the best actors alive (granted gladiator is one of my favorite movies) and people just try to come up with different jokes to mock his appearance... Let the man live how he wants to.
Getting the same vibes from the Brandon Frasier some while ago, we don't know what he's been through, why do we need to mock him like that, seems so pointless to me.
I know it's just a joke but the limit should be joking about a person's weight, no matter who that person is."
