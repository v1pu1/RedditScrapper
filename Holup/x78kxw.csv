5,"Good luck getting that creosote type tanning lotion off, I worked with a woman whose bf was a competitive body builder.

While asleep he put his hand on her side(this was hours after applying the tanning creosote).

2 weeks later she still had his handprint on her sideðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"
6,Shit he got infected
7,Shit covered man
8,I would the same to that bodybuilder and I'm 33
9,Is the child crying because he was white underneath or because he wasnâ€™t edible??
10,uhm why
11,Lazy punk
12,I guess the tan spray helps them look more lean and brings out the definition or something. It's like an essential thing in competitions from what I know
13,I worked at a hotel and they had a body building event and I'm sorry but most of these guys are fuckin weirdos. They got there spray tan and body grease everywhere too.
14,"Pretty sure it's the darker tans allow for the definition in muscles to be seen better, it's why they only tan up for competitions and not weekly."
15,"As some mentioned, it shows definition better and shadowing. Look at literally any pic where someone wants to show definition to look bigger and they will use overhead lighting as a trick. 

Something is off here though because tanning is essential, but this guy looks like he used makeup instead and the oil and/or sweat is making it come off."
16,Not remotely shocked ðŸ¤¢
