4,Rent collector.
5,The breeder
6,"They always get captured and taken outside. Guess that makes me a pacifist but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the appropriate title. 

In the spider‚Äôs eyes‚Ä¶It should be hero."
7,"All of them, if its on me I will loose my shit and then kill it. If its chilling in a corner of the ceiling it can just vibe there and kill bugs."
8,Killer!
9,"Pacifist and zookeeper

Bring them outside if they're indoors, actively encourage the ones outside near our front door and on the porch. If we ever find an insect inside, we grab it and put it in the web. And mosquitoes outside also go into the web. Last year we had one near our front door named Parker (named after Peter Parker obviously)."
10,The raper
11,The Ignorer

19,Everyone in my house is the screamer and I'm sick of having to be the one killing the bug.
20,"Mostly the Killer, occasionally the Pacifist because I realize they keep out the more annoying insects.

If you ever see me as the Zookeeper though, call the cops. That sure as hell is someone else impersonating me (poorly)"
21,Def the zookeeper
22,The snacker
23,"A mix of zookeeper and killer. I'm not gonna go out of my way to kill a spider if it's just chilling in a corner, but if it gets on my bed, any tables or my desk it forfeits its life."
24,Unironically the pacifist. I'm not scared of spiders at all

26,The predator
27,The consumer

29,"Let's see .. I've got a rather big writing spider outside my kitchen window that I've watched grow all summer who know has eggs so there that ,and a bird that Google doesn't know if it's a pigeon or dove that my housemate found in the street a week ago after a storm (wings are clipped)that's doing good , had a gray rat snake that I kept through the winter and let loose under the house . I guess I'm the keeper ."

37,The mad scientist
38,Killer
39,Multi Leggedussy
40,I‚Äôm a Anti-Matter bomb type of person.
41,"Depending on freakiness, 1 being zookeeper, 10 being scream then kill, 5 is pacifism. If it's a moth or a lizard, I would move it outside via napkin or something. An ant or ladybug, I let it crawl around on my hand as I move it. Roach or silverfish die like the icky monsters they are."

69,Thats some james bond shit. Just use a book and move on with your life
70,How much do you collect from the spiders?
