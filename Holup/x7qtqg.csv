3,"Hm... For me it got 8 tags correctly, 3 wrong (one drastically so) and... Dafuk is an Abotinreddit? Does reddit think I'm not only religious but a christian monk at that? lol"
4,"I thought the stats would be interesting since I don't talk/comment that much, so I looked mine up.  
I then see ""text readability"" and mine is 17 and Very high.

So apparently you need a College graduate reading level to understand my texts. So I am either a complete idiot and you need to have a graduate degree to decipher my texts or I maybe don't abbreviate enough and it means I'm full of hot air? lol"

14,"I looked up your profile. You aren't active enough for the site to make a guess... Or you don't talk about yourself enough.

From what I can tell, the words chosen for me were about things I talk about. My father was a child beater and I'm convinced I'll end up just like that if I were to drink alcohol. In the past I probably said something like ""I'll end up as a child beater if I drink alcohol."" 

I also frequently refer to myself as a ""New-ish achievement hunter"" in the Xbox Subreddit's. I think it's based on things you call yourself."
15,"Bruh I’ve said kill 1200 times, the second highest is 17."
