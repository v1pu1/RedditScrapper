15,Take my award
16,I used to go to the range in my ons and had this problem. The parking lot at my place has a bunch of brass kicking around from when Iâ€™d get back and pick them out lolol
17,Hey nice on clouds
18,You donâ€™t come back with your shoes. Not in Chicago
19,Lies. There's no cigarette butts or broken glass. Oil either of that's just asphalt.
20,"Better than Detroit, you wouldâ€™ve lost the shoes"
21,"The nerve of some people, how would they litter around"
22,I wouldn't have understood without those emojis

26,Something tells me his shoes should be the least of his concerns

32,Or walking to the garbage can in the lunch room
33,In america*
34,"Top 5 thing to do in Chicago! 
#1. leave"
35,"Wow, cool pic where you stuck empty shells in your own shoe for internet points."
36,This never happened
37,Or the shooting range
38,Gun rights. Conservatives complaining about chicago are basically advocating for gun control
39,"For those who don't speak conservative,  Chicago =blacks."
40,"No no no, looks like running to and from the bathroom at school here in America"
41,Teenagers after a PE class anywhere in the US
42,"

52,The guy that did the shooting...
53,The French
54,Came hear for the same. Take my upvote.
55,Boomers who want to make this stuff up for attention.
56,"The inner brass goblin is coming out, gotta hit the range with a pair of these and see if I can stealth grab some shit."
57,It's possible when you can drive 20 minutes away to the next state and buy as many as you want.
58,Guns aren't illegal. Thanks for narrow-minded narrative
59,"Laws aren't made for that. They're made to segregate the classes with state sanctioned violence.

![gif](giphy|WfBZwNA6XSjphkYkzN)"
60,Don't even. Chicago is nothing like that. Outside of Englewood. Englewood is like that sometimes.
61,Or criminals not owning guns.
62,But Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws.
63,....Jesus Christ......no. No one reads it that way.... just... Jesus
64,Thats racist you know that
65,"i mean this image got potato quality but it looks like that
idk too much abt bullets tho"
66,Someone cycled a jam and forgot to pickup the cartridge.
67,It would take a whole lot more than jumping on it with your full bodyweight to make it fire without a pin striking the cap.
68,*Who's
69,Was just gonna say anyone who doesn't wanna get shoot.
70,Kevlar jeans
71,"You misspelled ""Zoomers""."
72,But it would still be illegal to bring it back to Chicago
73,"They aren't, but they are heavily restricted/regulated there."
74,FR Chicago isnâ€™t even top 10 most dangerous anymore. If anything needs to be clowned on its Chicagoâ€™s mayor looking like a troll doll.
75,[45 people shot this weekend](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/7-dead-at-least-41-wounded-in-chicago-shootings-over-labor-day-weekend/2931530/)
76,They don't thou... try again
77,"They could have purchased reloading brass with new primers and stuck them to the bottom of a shoe.  I mean I feel every tiny pebble,  this person canâ€™t feel at least 3 random bullet casings lodged in their shoe, 1 of which is embedded straight up into it like a nail of hate?"
78,Someone made up a title for an unrelated picture. Probably sweeps up brass at a shooting range.. Jogging in Chicago!
79,"Bruh, that shit is gold with these ammo prices being wild."
80,The owls?
81,"Sure, but you can shoot a lot of people before anyone knows you have it. It's a state border, defined by a line on a map and a sign, not a wall with guards and metal detectors."
82,"Dude, have you seen what a Cali compliant rifle looks like? The highest legal magazine capacity is 10 for fucks sake. Pistol grips are banned! Folding stocks and collapsible stocks are banned! Flash hiders are banned! Threaded barrels on pistols are banned! You can't have a regular old semi-auto pistol!"
83,...and yet still not wrong.
84,Right? They're worth their weight in gold these days it seems. Even .22 LR is expensive.
85,"Well if they post enough signs saying it's illegal, that should stop any and all crime I imagine."
86,The craziest price Iâ€™ve seen for bunk ass 22lr was for 30 bucks for 50 rounds at the height of the pandemic.
87,"Now you're just trolling... Every bar and place you can buy liquor has a sign saying people under 21 can't drink, has that stopped any and all underage drinking?"
88,It's time to go back to muzzleloaders. A gun without ammo is useless.
89,Oh there's my point
