1,Pay & Sit is a park bench dreamed up by designer Fabian Brunsing.  In 2010 it was thought that this would never be implemented.  The fee is .50 euros.  There is an alarm before you get spiked.  EA never gives you a warning before it fucks you over.
2,Imagine forgetting the timer and keep sitting on it
3,How is that made by EA if it is finished before release?
4,"Jokes on you, I‚Äôm into that"
5,Id sit on it
6,Bro I got all kinds of money and I'm not homeless but I'm not pulling out a quarter to sit on a bench
7,"Or... you can spend like $8 and put some concrete pavers on the bench which are thick enough to avoid the spikes.

Realistically, though, shit like this is how you end up needing new benches."
8,Tbh we're terrifyingly close to this world anyway. Anti-homelessness architecture is real.
9,hollow knight be like
10,"So like, what is the ordinance around this? Say I come to this park and have never heard, or seen this before and sit down because I‚Äôm not paying attention and hurt myself? Who do I collect the money from? What is the best way to slam down onto this to make a hole in my leg without hitting a major artery? Or I suppose I could bring a sawzall and metal cut-off blade. Lol. If I was petty enough and lived nearby one, I would buy sheets of plexiglass, secure spaces for the spikes and then join it to the Bench after midnight. All for the homeless people. Fuck the system. I used to drive by a slum on m in way to work, and would hand water bottles out to the guys standing outside while I was at the light."
11,"If this an actual thing and a small child gets hurt ..,.I'm first in line to give them a kick in the balls/ hoof it in the front butt"
12,"I‚Äôd still sit on it. If it hurts, I‚Äôll just put my sweater on it."
13,I don't know officer I suddenly had this grinder in my hand and then out of nowhere the spikes fell off
14,To only find that the change machine is broken and you keep putting money into it
15,"And everyone is always laughing and mocking me for carrying around that piece of plywood; but who is sitting and laying for free?... plywood guy, that's who."
16,Still better than if Paradox would made it
17,"If I can remember the first one was made by artist Fabian Brunsing as an art installation, called ‚ÄòPay and Sit- the Private Bench‚Äù, and from what I‚Äôve read some park managers in china have/want to recreate it. Feel free to correct anything I may have gotten wrong/missed."
18,Don't give them ideas.
19,Ubisoft bench just kind of falls apart because it was built out of parts of old benches and nobody really bothered checking if it was complete.
20,YOU MORONS ITS NOT A BENCH IT IS A: Seating Live Service
21,sit on the back of the bench like cool kids in earlier days
22,"More anti homeless sentiments. Damn, they are people too"
23,That's a pretty cool idea. Kinda like those magic fingers beds from the old days
24,Who tf downvoted?
25,Pretty sure these come with the new BMWs
26,Fuckin whack a mole time! Where's my sledge hammer?
27,Stolen meme
28,I would just sit on the side corner where there aren't spikes
29,Shiiiiit did you play Diablo immortal? This has blizzard written all over it
30,"Ty, I'll stand."
31,At that point im perfectly content sitting back against that tree.
32,Pay to win
33,"This bench has been created by the ""very human"" guy against diarrhea

here's an example of one of his machine with schlatt

[very human guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcTHGayLD3I)"
34,I‚Äôll just sit on the top of the back support like all the cool kids
35,Someone should get cut of wood or something with holes placed correctly and super glue the shit out of it to attach
36,Sick 20 dollar bench skin
37,Is there a premium membership for sitting on these benches??
38,It puts a vr headset that plays ads on you and you have to pay to remove the ads.
39,Dammit
40,"Jokes on them,I stab myself in the ass every night."
41,sEAt
42,ill sit on the floor
43,"That won‚Äôt stop me, extra service"
44,when someone said floor is lava and u see this bench
45,masochist be having the time of their day
46,Fucking true bro
47,You think those things will stop me?
48,New way of trolling ppl
49,"It might be painful when the timer comes to the end ... hope there's a ""loud"" bip :)"
50,"A week would pass and those spikes would be absolutely destroyed, alongside with the bench."
51,Yeah if you live in a city that has these you might want to get a different mayor.
52,Boy a deaf man will get a hell of a law suit
53,Just ask the fans of Dragon Age and Mass Effect
54,"So pay the fee, then use a spot welder to permanently break the mechanism and screw over the bastards who installed this thing. If they replace the bench, just do it again and continue to do so until they stop doing it."
55,"No your not getting it, you pay ea to fuck you with a sharp stick."
56,The spikes were installed first. Found out not many people were using it so they had the bench dlc added for convenience.  The constant stabbing feeling and loss of blood will cost extra though
57,"We got a location for these benches? I need to test this out. For science, of course."
58,"Louis, the peasants are revolting again."
59,That kinda sounds like something a broke homeless guy would say.
60,As a Hollow Knight player. This reminds me of the White Palace. I am not prepared for that in real life.
61,Your plexiglass idea is pretty good.
62,"Relax, sweaty. This isn't a real park bench, it's sarcastic art."
63,"This was installed in Yantai Park in Shangdong province, eastern China after seen the art installation by German artist Fabian Brunsing (the photo above).

Since there‚Äôs barely any human rights over in China, if a child was hurt on this, no one would do anything about it"
64,"nah paradox is fine, they make money off of people who don't realize 2 extra types of park fences for Cities: Skylines are not worth $14.99"
65,I don't think they would do it here in China. People here a known to be spacious to the point of going to mc donalds just for sleep. Or siting on a cafe bench without buying anything. This is kind of cultural.
66,Magic finger beds???
67,Yeah!!!!!ü§¨
68,What does being dope have to do with it?
69,I'd hate to see what Activisions version would be...
70,Now that makes sense!
71,"They've always been revolting, now they're rebelling."
72,I most certainly am not sweaty ü•µ
73,"Woah, wild claim that no one would do anything about it. If a child was hurt on it 3-5 government censors would be making sure no one posted about it. 1-2 government handlers would threaten the doctor and family about spreading the information of how the child was hurt."
74,Your examples are exactly why a business or city would want these benches.
75,"You used to see them in hotel rooms way back in the day.  Pop in a quarter and the bed would vibrate for a few minutes.  It was supposed to be like a massage, hence the ""magic fingers."""
76,If they can't hear the alarm they will get spiked
77,you‚Äôd insert the coin and you have a 1/3 chances of the spikes lowering so you can sit.
78,"No, I meant what I said. Sweaty, not sweety. As in sweaty guy. You sure seemed to break a sweat dreaming up those scenarios. Again, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe system‚Äù trying to fuck anyone over, it‚Äôs an art installation ffs"
79,"Oh yeah,I just never heard anyone describe them that way with that name"
80,"I believe that was a brand name, but honestly it was before my time."
