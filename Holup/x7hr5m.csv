1,Don't forget how much it hurts to realize you have to pee and your dickhole has been closed
2,Bruh.why are you telling them about hole day?
3,"And here you thought that they were invented for teeth.  Obviously not; those little wooden sticks are the ORIGINAL ""dick pick""."
4,only like 10% of guys have to do that
5,Some men have learned that bathing helps.
6,I use a small razor to reopen the slit every alternate day
7,Dang I have to use a 7mm sounding rod
8,Fools I keep a straw stuffed in there so that I don‚Äôt have to poke it.
9,Yeah man.. it's weird to see people today don't know about this. Also that fake ass white semen in porn lol. Everybody knows real semen is red
10,I actually had to get an operation done to open my urethra. It did end up closing but not to being dirty. It just decided to closed and fuse together and it was extremely painful when i had to urinate. They did the operation and told me its going to hurt a big when you finally pee because of the operation and shit. A bit my ass that shit made me scream and cry so fuckin loud in the hospital. I was like 12 at the time. Pissing blood out my dick. Now i have 2 holes in my dick. Ones just for show.
11,It's true. And if it doesn't get sucked at least once a week it starts to shrink until it becomes nonexistent. We deal with a lot but never talk about it üòî
12,What? You people aren't doing that?
13,"Ah yeah, people over at r/sounding discuss this issue a lot!"
14,"Went to the emergency room for a uti a few years ago. For dudes, insurance requires them to do an sti test for it. If you‚Äôre never had a sti test, they swab it with a q-tip. Yes, it. Not the outside, the inside. I swear it is just there as a deterrent so you don‚Äôt goto the ER for a uti, worst experience of my life."
15,Only when it turns blueish green and the scales start forming??
16,Go see a doctor please
17,Finally someone sharing my pain
18,"This looks like a reply to the tampon in while peeing posts. Don‚Äôt feed the trolls, obviously everyone knows that it‚Äôs only every other week."
19,Do you not know this? Lol women ‚òïÔ∏è
20,"What the actual fuck? Does anybody really do this ? (Speaking of the refered hygiene, not your kinks)"
21,"This guy is either not washing his dick all that much and/or he barely pees.

Edit: some of you need to learn the meaning of the phrase ""entertaining a hypothetical""."
22,"![gif](giphy|6iRkrFbUaY2kw)

Probably has a narrow urethra"
23,Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who does this
24,man that hurts
25,That's how I got into r/sounding
26,That's. . . That's not. . . Nevermind
27,Wait no one else here does???
28,r/sounding can help you find all of the necessary medical equipment to keep your hole open.
29,Huh?
30,If I miss the 1 week window I need to use a welding rod.
31,That's not true. You can also use a pencil eraser.
32,I don't get it? Why? It doesn't make sense even if I assume he is talking about eggplant (literal).
33,"Yeah, I once forgot the toothpick while going on 3 days school trip. It was close to condition needing seeing doctor, but I used a needle first, when came home and it ended fine. That was risky tho"
34,The hole truth and nothing but the truth.
35,#DID HE STUTTER
36,Deaf people are lucky they don't have to hear how loud the sun is.
37,"bro, I hate when I forget to do that and I have to pee. Oaghhhh, it hurts so much üò≠‚òùÔ∏è"
38,"pathetic. metal pole

r/sounding"
39,This sounds made up. This can't be real. Can it?
40,"Dude, you have an STI!

And your STI has Cancer!"
41,I can't wait to tell my husband he's been using his wrong this whole time.
42,Why are we talking about the reopening? We were sworn to secrecy‚Ä¶ next you guys will bring up the poop knife. stfu!
43,You mean you guys don‚Äôt?
44,When you run out of toothpicks and have to use the Nintendo DS stylus üò©
45,Sometimes I do 3 or 4 holes when I want to be able to pee faster
46,Sometimes with a pin because the toothpick will snap
47,No the fuck we don‚Äôt.
48,And the monthly foreskin shedding.
49,"Bruh, I think if you have to do this, you should see a specialist."
50,"I waited to long one time and they had to do surgery and they messed up when they were redrilling now I have no head, just cylinder dick"
51,This post was clearly made by women trying to find guy secrets
52,"Soulja Boy: ""HUH ü§®"""
53,"As a male, I confirm that this is in fact true"
54,"It's really sad looking at all the comments of people who have never been taught proper hygiene. Society really needs to put more emphasis on teaching kids how to be hygienic instead of just telling them TO be hygienic. 
Alright so it's pretty simple, anytime your wee-wee feels tingly or gets really hard it means that your pee-hole isn't getting enough air inside it so you grab a toothpick and stick it in, longer ones are better as sometimes the jam could be a little far up there and it WILL hurt the first few times but this will significantly reduce your risk of STI's. Thank you please like and subscribe"
55,"This is damn misinformation.. I never had to do any of these, my teeth work just fine"
56,I'm curious how many people would believe that
57,"As always

Who the fuck is ""we""?"
58,"Wait... Women don't have to do that? Unfair! Women should have to suffer just like men. Like, maybe they could suddenly start bleeding down there on a regular basis. Then they could begin to understand why men can be such moody, emotional pricks every month.

Keeping the penis open and free of blockages hurts worse than childbirth, I swear to God!

/s ^<---- ^shouldn't ^need ^this, ^but ^you ^know ^Reddit."
59,Oh great my girl friend saw this and she wants an explanation. Thanks alot op
60,I think he is on semen retention

63,![gif](giphy|RCX9vhBZu3oqM5SpwV)
64,Ducking ow dude
65,Oooo so is that why i can't cummm...
66,"This is why parents need to be upfront with their children.  ""So, you guys *DON'T* have to poke y'all's dick with toothpicks???"""
67,Be a man and use your teeth to reinstate your hole

80,"I thought you weren't going to tell them..

Gentlemen, the NDA has been broken, he must be eliminated

Also bathing in hit water keeps the hole open"
81,The splinters are the worst
82,Also penis inspection day. Always the worst part of the week. üôÅ
83,This is where the name 'Holiday' comes from
84,"um, any man wanna explain if that actually happens or not"
85,Never talk about hole day.
86,I thought this was irony at first. Then I remembered that motherfuckers can reach middle age and still fail to know how not to be so filthy their dick literally seals up with crust.
87,"Who's got the toothpick now? Is it my turn? Pass it over, Fred."
88,"When I was 3, I guess my urethral opening wasn‚Äôt wide enough so my mom took me to the doctor to open it up. No local anesthetic because I suppose the thought was I was too young to remember it. Let me tell you that I remember every excruciating detail to this day. The sterile color of the room, the doctor, my mom holding me down while the doctor took a scalpel and cut a wider slit on the tip of my dick. I think about that when my own kids go to the doctor now. It doesn‚Äôt matter how young you are if the experience is traumatic enough."
89,"My older sister tricked me into thinking boys got their periods too. That‚Äôs what q-tips are for, she said."
90,Why did women think Swiss army knives came with toothpicks in them? For our teeth? Ha!
91,"Also just like, squish it so it opens like an otamatone"
92,Dilate
93,This is the kind of thing an older brother tells his younger brother just to fuck with him.
94,Wait til girls find out we have to shit in our hands and slap our faces once a week... They're gonna be pissed.
95,Secrets out guys!!
96,Wait na is this true?
97,I don‚Äôt even call it a toothpick anymore it‚Äôs the prick pick
98,"I just blast through with my brown, syrupie piss."
99,Who tf?
100,"That‚Äôs why it was affectionately known as a Prick.
