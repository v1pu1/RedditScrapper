16,Pork rinds are exploded pig skins. Yummy
17,"Yes, we have. Trust me! Humans like BOOM. Or putting things into a microwave oven..."
18,They did.  Stopped with cows though.  Just got too messy.
19,"Popping sorghum is a thing, tiny little pieces that look like popcorn.  But any starch will liquefy under heat and pressure and explode when released.   I've heard peanut puffs are excellent (also would make a cool band name)"
20,Lemon
21,Yes there is a very special food called a ‚Äúbattery‚Äù the effects are even better when you put them in a microwave like corn
22,It worked with skittles if you freeze dry them. They explode like popcorn and become 10x better

28,Poffy
29,any place that sells them?
30,"30 mins. Don't worry, you're fine to walk away and leave it unsupervised"
31,"The thing is, the food needs a type of ""casing"" to develop enough pressure, so that it can rapidly expand once the pressure drops.  
Corn comes with a natural casing that does the job, while for rice you need something like a pressure cooker.  
It also works with wheat, so i guess there are many more."
32,Hmmm need more data just explode the parents too
33,"I sell them, but only locally. You can get them on amazon last time I checked, just check the reviews some people cheap out and don't freeze dry them all the way, you want them nice and crunchy no squish."
34,"If you put a fork in the bag, it pops quicker"
35,Can confirm. It also puts on a nice light show.
36,That's one popping hot show
