1,There ain't no way unless he was given up for adoption
2,""".. we've met each other's families"" ðŸ‘€ more than you knew"
3,"Jokes aside imagine finding yourself in this situation and how fucked up that would be, especially if you're ""in love"". Seriously messed.  

I'm usually laughing at the idiots who end up on r/holup bit if this is true I actually feel pretty bad for them."
4,"I wouldn't tell anyone.
But ok"
5,"Them, one year later: ""You have your daddy-uncle's eye."""
6,"Closer kin, deeper in."
7,Notice the headline does not say ex boyfriend. Guess they are still close.
8,This is heartbreaking
9,"The world is truly small, huh?"
10,"We slept together, we bathed together, we even shared the same piece of mint flavored dental floss."
11,"""not the actual photo""..."
12,At least they didn't have children together o.o
13,Incest is wincest
14,"Back story: I had a cousin that gave up a little girl for adoption around the same time my wife was born and adopted by her mother and father. Her mother and father were friends with another much older cousin of mine. His wife arranged both adoptions. My father vaguely knew my wifeâ€™s father back in the day but hers and my immediate family really didnâ€™t know each other. These cousins of mine were all on the same side of my family. Apparently it was common knowledge among my extended family that my cousins wife had arranged these adoptions and my wife always knew who had arranged her adoption. However, her mother was very tight lipped about the details of my wifeâ€™s adoption. When my wife and I were engaged, my great aunt, mother of the older cousin, started speculating that my wife was the same baby in both adoptions and were were thus related. It wasnâ€™t a huge issue for us due to a few other circumstances I will mention but I had to nip that rumor in the bud before it grew bigger. I went to my wifeâ€™s mother and explained the situation and asked her to confirm or deny that my wife and I were actually related. She told me that she knew and had casually met my wifeâ€™s biological mother and we were not related. She said she was aware of the other adoption and would have immediately known if there was an issue. As it turned out  my cousin who had given up the child for adoption was the adopted daughter of my great uncle and had my same last name at the time. That  killed any blood relation problems plus that cousin was was like a third cousin(?) and it was not illegal for us to be together. I knew this before I talked to my wifeâ€™s mother but I had to get ahead of the story. Back then I was a brash cocky young man and either way my wifeâ€™s mother had answered, I was formulating just how I was gonna tell my family to go F@$k themselves and STFU because I didnâ€™t care because nothing was gonna stop me. Luckily it didnâ€™t come to that. Years later we actually located and met my wifeâ€™s biological mother and father.

Hope that made sense."
15,This just seems like a deep dark secret that most people wouldn't post an article about.
16,Say it ain't so!
17,"I mean, I would just take it in stride after 6 years..

19,Aight boys time to get to friggin alabama untill dusk
20,"In the full story they're both adopted, which is what they bonded over during the early stages of their relationship"
21,Both of them are adopted
22,Always the suprise the families looked so similar
23,[removed]
24,What do you think we would be worse the finding out or realising youâ€˜re probably going to have to tell someone. Like family and friends when explaining the break up.
25,Just don't have kids.
26,"Six years later, fuck it. There's nothing left they didn't do anyway."
27,Yet
28,"I remember looking into this after seeing the married sibblings with the trex children they had. From what I understand, it can take generatioms of imbreeding to have messed up children. Not saying the chances are low, but depending on how Alabama the genes are, they can end up with almost normal children or the personafication of southern banjo noises."
29,Please donâ€™t encourage them
30,"dude, i have never been more confused in my life, is your wife your cousin or not ?"
31,"Paragraphs, what are they...."
32,"Oh damn, thatâ€™s kinda funny"
33,"If feel that that would be a standard concern for people who have been adopted that they date someone they are related to.
Crazy that they didn't check it out for 6 years. - but in the other hand if you are in love you probably don't want to go looking for problems"
34,And this possibility never once crossed their mind in 6 years?
35,LMAO
36,This guy warthoglongy is either a bot or a comment copier please do not upvote they have been copying other comments in quite a few posts
37,"Yeah, but it's still fucked lol I mean, once it's out there, it's OUT THERE."
38,Just as long as they never have kids i suppose.
39,banjoman gazes at his sister and wonders...
40,No.
41,Damn. You are right. Iâ€™m usually a decent writer. Guess I was in a hurry.
42,"That is why I just don't date. I live in a small state and know for a fact my birther had 5 daughters. 

Its like a .01% chance"
43,You ask like I have answers for you
44,"I was adopted at birth.  At age 34, I was able to locate my biological mother who helped me to find my biological father.  My mother got to hold me for about half an hour before I was whisked away to my adopted parents.  She never knew my name.  She had two children after me.  Her husband knew about my existence from the beginning of their relationship, but my half-siblings didn't know until I contacted my mother.  Now, I'm aware of all my biological siblings on both sides.  Point of the story is that your mother could have had a child before you that she never told you about and it could possibly have been the last person you fucked.  Had that thought ever crossed your mind?"
45,"Bro, seriously what are the chances of that happening?"
46,For a second I thought you were replying to yourself
47,Gross
48,Every time I nut.
49,">Had that thought ever crossed your mind?

Constantly."
50,"Your story is eerily similar to my wifeâ€™s family. Her mother gave up a daughter to adoption, then had two kids later on.  It not that uncommon."
51,"The problem is ""genetic sexual attraction.""

Humans are biologically attracted to those who are genetically similar, but not closely related by blood - and the more genetically similar you are, the higher the attraction is, *as long as you're not close relatives*.

Issues arise when you don't realize you're related to each other, or you meet a sibling well into adulthood - strange feelings can result from that."
52,"Apparently 100% in their case.

 Talking about how rare something is doesn't really give any comfort to the unlucky person who just experienced it. 

In fact, it's kind of insensitive..."
