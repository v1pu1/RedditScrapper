1,What the fuck
2,"No, your daughters don't wanna have sex with you because you're their FATHER. Jesus."
3,"I mean, my dad smelled like Vitalis but that's not why I... ugh, I can't even write the rest of this sentence."
4,"He is technically right in most of the West. Anti-incest laws are usually a 3 degree parentage block, so you(0)->parent(1)->granparent(2)->uncle/aunt(3)->cousin(4), cousin marriage is legal in most of the West, and anything beyond that wouldn't even raise eyebrowns.

As for the parent thing, I'm not much of a fan of psychology, but I believe Freud, that degenerate that said every problem you have is because you want to fuck your parents, said that kids are always attracted to the parent of the opposite gender and beat heads against the parent of the same gender, but then again, I've heard most of what Freud ever said is now considered wrong, so I don't know how valid this guy's opinion is on the subject"
5,This story doesn't pass the smell test.  Figure it's fake news.

7,"What is his doctorate in?

(Other than his second cousins)"
8,"Hi, honey, would you like to have sex with me?

No, Dad, I hate how you smell..."
9,"*”As long as they are more than a first cousin away.”*  But then eludes to trying to sleep with his own daughters?!  You don’t even stick to your own rules!  

Also - What in the southern fried fuck is going on here?!"

11,So much wrong with this
12,What in the Alabama fuck is going on
13,Every conservative turns out to be a creepy pedo weirdo in the end
14,"Cmon, Dad.  Take a shower next time.  


But seriously...I think what Dr. Oz was talking about was that women have the ability to tell via pheromones whether a male is a good genetic match.  A father's genes are too close, so a women would be repelled by the smell as nature's way of keeping them from mating in the caveman days."
15,"My problem with this is that he had to have asked his daughters to have sex with him, to find out they didn't want to because he smells."
16,"Honestly, how do these grifting, dregs of society succeed to the level they do? Honest people, people with integrity and character struggle to make ends meet while these low lives flourish like poisonous flowers.  It must be the freedom offered by having no conscience and a willingness to use and abuse anyone to grasp their way to the top of the sludge."
17,Explains why trump endorses him.
18,ew! but also EEEEEWWWWW
19,This be something that might actually help his campaign if it were a different state 🤔
20,"And people will still vote for him.
FFS"
21,Ohhh… is he running as a Republican? Is that why these things are being taken out of context?
22,He smells like a zombie outhouse.
23,"So... He actually sounds like he's contemplated or maybe even tried to bang his daughters. 
But sadly the smell was the deal breaker"
24,"I have heard this put more scientifically before. I think he just chose his words poorly. I'm no fan,  but I won't kill him for this one."
25,Ya man I mean he speaks from experience.  He got shot down thank God
26,This is the guy conservatives want to represent them.
27,Nothing says lovin’ like loving your cousin.
28,"Genetically, he’s right. Socially and ethically, he’s dubious at best. The medical field knows things that would sicken most people outside it. This is one of those turd covered nuggets of wisdom that were pulled from a steaming pile of data I would never want to see."
29,Yeah. This was way out of context. Is he running Republican or something?
30,That made for an awkward Thanksgiving dinner.
31,… why you wanna jump his bones?
32,"Wasn't Freud a pioneer in the ""field"" of psychoanalysis which is not yet a recognized field of science? 

Idk how much of the claims of him being wrong are true themselves, a lot of them seemed to be penned by people who are personally offended by Freud's theories. I don't think there's enough research being done on these matters to really say if Freud was right or wrong yet. 

Please feel free to correct me."
33,It's actually real but not nearly as bad in context. He still sucks though.
34,odd-- considering the actor in the gif was charged with owning material dealing with under aged children.
35,"> , I hate how you smell...

There are actual studies that show we naturally dislike the smell of those we are closer related to, it was an evolutionary trait when we lived in smaller communities."
36,"Yeah, I’d want to check what the fuck was actually said here myself. This looks suss as hell"
37,My opinion is that the current US system rewards psychopathic behavior.
38,Yeah because he’s not an evul lib!!
39,"It is only slightly being taken out of context. It’s from an interview where someone asks if it’s okay to keep smashing his cousin. His medical response was that it wasn’t that big of an issue if they are distant cousins, then goes on to talk about how people who are related don’t like how each other smell. He digs into the example he gives about his daughters. [It’s really fucking weird.](https://jezebel.com/dr-oz-on-incest-more-than-first-cousin-not-a-big-pro-1849501672/)"
40,"The crazy thing is, he's not extreme enough for them."
41,Sadly yes. He’s going to cause republicans to lose a senate seat that could have been won.
42,You're not helping.
43,">Wasn't Freud a pioneer in the ""field"" of psychoanalysis which is not yet a recognized field of science? 

He is recognized as the Father of Psychoanalizis, and regarded as the sole creator of the entire field.

 Psychology itself being but an infant from victorian science, serving as bedrock for his own field of studies, much of what he believed is wrong because the victorian psychology on which he based his studies was wrong, yet the idea of studying the brain, and attempting to find the root of mental problems, rather than just accepting some people go crazy from times to times held credit on it's own, and so he is credited with the creation of psycho-analizis even though much of his conclusions are now seen as wrong (kind like how Lamark was a pioneer of Evolution, but thought characterostics passed forward because the parents used it, rather than because of genes, which he didn't knew exist back then)"
44,"Most of his claims ended up being wrong, penis envy being my favorite example (essentially all womens issues are caused by them being jealous of not having a penis). He eventually became way too focused on dreams and he little to no success (documented success) of his dream analysis therapies working. He also cherry picked who he worked with to try and get the results he wanted from his therapy. His main accomplishments were talk therapy which he discovered by accident more or less, and his focus on childhood development. Other than those two things he didn’t really do much."

46,"![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major\_histocompatibility\_complex#In\_sexual\_mate\_selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#In_sexual_mate_selection)

In 1995, Claus Wedekind found that in a group of female college students who smelled T-shirts worn by male students for two nights (without deodorant, cologne, or scented soaps), by far most women chose shirts worn by men of dissimilar MHCs, a preference reversed if the women were on oral contraceptives.\[35\] In 2005 in a group of 58 subjects, women were more indecisive when presented with MHCs like their own,\[36\] although with oral contraceptives, the women showed no particular preference.\[37\] No studies show the extent to which odor preference determines mate selection (or vice versa).

So, maybe for reasons related to adaptive immune system."
47,"Here’s the thing about Freud though. He more or less created talk therapy and theorized that trauma from childhood can cause issues later in life, his idea of id ego and superego conceptually arent that bad either. Everything else though and I mean EVERYTHING is just batshit crazy. Dreams, wanting to fuck your parents, penis envy, etc… In my opinion he is overrated."
48,"Interesting, thank you!"
