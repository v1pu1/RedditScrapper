7,"Lmao. My gf and I both got divorced at the same time. Worked together. Started hanging out and talking about divorce and work stuff. Got drunk a few times and slept together. Stopped doing that. Then 2020 hit and I was looking to move apartments. She had just bought a house and said ""Why don't we bunker down together while this covid thing blows over.

Anyway I was at the kids open house the other day asking her new teacher questions and this might be more than bunkering down for a month or two."

26,I've never been any good at determining where I am in a relationship. When we were dating I referred to her as my girlfriend and she said that it was news to her. We're married now and still not very sure where we are. I know I can't see other women and pretty sure she can't see other guys. Beyond that I'm just winging it.

68,"Good on ya. Most young people take their relationships WAY to seriously anyways. They are either hyperventilating about commitments they arent ready to take on (or dont really understand) or trying to slam everything in sight to prove they aint ugly.  


You got this, Peace, Out!"

82,She knew exactly what she was doing bro. You just fumbled the bag. Or maybe it‚Äôs not too late lol
83,"Are you sure?

 Made a baby and now all homo maybe. Made his ridiculous parents happy and then lives his best life!"
84,"People get caught up in the words but nah sometimes you just get stuck in someone's lane long enough you just wanna stick with them the rest of their journey.

Love and bonds don't have to be some super complicated thing. Just like how family can never talk for like a decade but the moment one of them need help they show up ready to do something for them.

Don't try to understand the human condition it's an enigma to which we can only rule out the most blatant of repetitive patterns."
85,"Yup 19 years, not sure when exactly we ‚Äògot together‚Äô so no anniversary, no marriage, no kids. Just 2 people and 1 cat enjoying life and not overthinking stuff"
86,"I'm literally single because my crush tried to make me confess my feelings for her.. didn't go well..
We had mutual feelings.. I knew she liked me, she knew I liked her.. But somehow I couldn't verbalise it.. we eventually stopped talking and then lost contact."
