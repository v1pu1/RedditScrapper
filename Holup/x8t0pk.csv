1,Are we sure that’s not his daughter? I take my daughter on “daddy/daughter dates” all the time. Does anyone know?
2,So… the 12yo had the top down?
3,Exactly what I was thinking
4,"It's a little weird to call it a date but not a weird thing to go cruising around for fun like that. Anyway, It's definitely his daughter yeah."
5,Cringe! Why would you call those dates? Do you call outings with your son or your friends dates too?
6,"I believe you are the cringe here bro. I also take my daughter out, we call it date night? When my son and I go out we call it bro day. It's more common when kids are younger, when they get older sure, it may be called something else. It sounds like you don't have kids, so I don't expect you to know what you're talking about."
7,"Because it's good to take your daughter out on dates so she knows what she should expect from someone. And what not to accept..
 
It's called teaching and loving your family. 

These  mother fuckers reach too much. Typical Redditors tho bro"
