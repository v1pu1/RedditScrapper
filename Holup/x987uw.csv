1,Is this some iPhone joke im too android to understand?
2,Oh shit Not good
3,"an actual hol up..nice 
nice"
4,"His first message is green, wouldn‚Äôt that mean that he sent it from an android, then his second message was sent with an iPhone? 

Maybe I just don‚Äôt know enough people with androids"
5,"Is the ""holup"" the fact that it's staged?"
6,"Ya know there is so many layers to this, first she got a phone but he added her phone number knowing she had an iPhone yet now she‚Äôs telling him she would sleep with her ex to get an iPhone but wouldn‚Äôt he know she cheated on him or at least suspect it or are they both idiots? Why would she even tell that in the first place? There‚Äôs no need to tell that if she cheated, so why?"
7,It isn‚Äôt always the case of it being different phones as sometimes with bad connection it will send as a text message which is green
8,When the wife have to go where the queen is
9,I dont get it
10,The best holups are the one that take you a second to realise.
11,This is so confusing
12,Plot twist she thought about the iPhone and just decided to buy it
13,I thought the husband had slept with her ex for the new iPhone
14,"Who the hell puts ""My Wife"" as their wife's contact name?"
15,is this a rich joke am too android to understand
16,Bf fucked her ex... there for all the Android folk
17,Took me too long to understand what was going on there.
18,Oh shit
19,So did the boyfriend cheat on his wife with the ex?
20,"Thank you for not being a queen meme

I was getting worried after the 8th one in a row"
21,Is this meme going to be posted here every year in September?..
22,Good ending: He bought a new phone and will give her the old one
23,It all happened so fast
24,How do we tell him?
25,me after ive seen this same image for the 27744th time
26,"‚ÄúPlease tell me you didn‚Äôt because i just texted him, i neec a new phone!‚Äù"
27,I m not an iPhone user.but I get it.xd
28,Is this some apple joke that I'm to android to understand?
29,iMessage.apk
30,Something my soon to be ex wife would do
31,Good actually real hol up
32,whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
33,A wierd apple joke
34,[removed]
35,"I think he slept with the ex himself to get the iPhone, notice how his text turns from green (Android) to blue (iphone)"
36,"When somebody sends a text from a iPhone(what‚Äôs he using) to a android user it‚Äôs green, but when it‚Äôs sent to a iPhone user it‚Äôs blue"
37,Green is a normal SMS (can be sent from another iPhone or an android) blue is an iMessage text (can only be sent from another iPhone *if it has internet*)‚Ä¶so the wife did sleep with the ex and lied about it‚Ä¶that‚Äôs how the bubble turned from green to blue since now they both have iMessage
38,me too im android
39,"I don't understand either, im using an s10, I don't even get 5g"
40,I don't get it. Please enlighten me
41,"
He bought a new phone and will give her the old one"
42,nah green indicates standard sms between any phones and blue is imessage between 2 iphones
43,Yeah he slept with her ex lol
44,"No, green means that you send msg throw sms and blue means that its send over internet (wifi Xg) ."
45,I wish. Painfully fake. Reminds me of Reader‚Äôs Digest jokes from the 90‚Äôs.
46,Another layer to it is that it's funny and staged for a joke
47,"it‚Äôs multiple layers. she received his first message from his non-iphone (green bubble). the second message was sent from an iphone (blue turned bubble) but also received on an iphone (seeing the blue bubble). so she was lying and he won his bet. obviously the guy who offered her the iphone had sex with her but can‚Äôt tell the other guy even when so losing his bet. (my) conclusion‚Ä¶ everyone got what they wanted. two got an iphone and one got to fuck her. all will be quiet and keep it a secret.

edit: since they‚Äôre husband and wife it‚Äôs probably not so easy to hide the new iphones but anyway. this is staged so ‚Ä¶. fun read. the end"
48,Helps differentiate them from other people's wives.
49,People that are happy lol. May be corny but if youre in love you dont care
50,"... not to mention all those emojis LOL

Also, this conversation is happening over text messages at 1:00 in the morning?"
51,The BF fucked the GFs ex for the iphone.
52,"When someone who has an android texts a person with an iPhone, the person with the iPhone sees the text bubbles are green.
When a person with an iPhone texts another person with an iPhone then the text bubbles are blue.

The girl started off with an android when her husband texted her ‚Äúplease tell me you didn‚Äôt‚Äù his text bubbles are green. So when she said she‚Äôs not a cheater and he texted back ‚Äúgood I love you‚Äù the text bubbles then were blue; meaning she slept with her ex and got an iPhone."
53,ü§°
54,Boy I guess if you'll believe that Andrew Tate is a good human being then you'll believe fucking anything
55,![gif](giphy|VdWnBa31M6BeY1Iv11|downsized)
56,"Two problems with that. One: there‚Äôs a like in line, and it‚Äôs prince charles. Two: Tate is a fucking piece of shit and isn‚Äôt even British, or a citizen of a commonwealth nation at that"
57,Joke not sooo funny
58,Troll of trolls
59,![gif](giphy|x0npYExCGOZeo|downsized)
60,Are you real? Wth
61,#kingTateFTW
62,Oh I thought blue was android
63,Also imessage at the top
64,I thought she cheated
65,What kind of messenger is this and why they don't simply use WhatsApp???
66,"My messages are purple, help"
67,Thanks finally someone who does not say ‚Äúgreen is for android‚Äú
68,"Now I get it, I've never had an iPhone so this was confusing to me. Thank you for the explanation."
69,Messages are different colors based upon the phone that receives them. Green is for other iPhones.
70,Yeah she just got a new flatrate after the first massage
71,"Nooo you missed the point she didn‚Äôt cheat, he did, that‚Äôs why is bubble is blue because now he has an iphone"
72,[deleted]
73,[removed]
74,Thank for clarifying apple guy
75,Just looked through his comment history. Biggest clown I‚Äôve seen on this site. And that is a fucking crazy thing to say
76,Why does his accent sound British then?
77,He‚Äôs not even Bri-ish
78,üóø
79,It is
80,"I think that was supposed to be the joke, but ..  poorly staged"
81,you‚Äôre sending messages to an iDroid
82,"It‚Äôs stupid af, idk where they got that from"
83,No problem :)
84,Blue is for other iPhones*
85,"So she had the iPhone, but switched to a non-iPhone?"
86,No. He always had an iPhone. If he switched phones from android to apple the old convo wouldn‚Äôt be there. This is how text messages show up from someone who switches to an iPhone
87,"Wth man, what kind of bitch move is it to report me for harassment- when you made the post saying your wife's cheating for an iPhone!?"
88,"And wtf you downvote me, for pointing out how you think both of you are happy and in love while you shitpost that she cheated on you? I'm just joking with you."
89,"since we‚Äôre being *accurate*, Blue is for iMessage\* which is sent via the internet and counted towards your data usage if you‚Äôre using the cellular network and not WiFi‚Äîas opposed to SMS which uses the standard comm protocols and counts towards your text messaging fees rather than data. 

It is exclusive to Apple devices, not necessarily an iPhone, but also Macs and iPads. it can be sent and received using emails linked to your apple account. but in this case it‚Äôs received with a *phone number* associated with the iMessage, therefore she must have an iPhone. 

But having an iPhone doesn‚Äôt mean your texts must become blue/iMessage. iMessage can be disabled/assigned to only specific number or emails."
90,"It means she received the first on Android, and the second on an iPhone... Presumably a new one.... ü§îü§îü§î"
91,No he slept with her ex lmao instead if her because now he has an iPhone thus blue bubble
92,"I have an Android and travel a lot, I've noticed that some of my messages showed green and others blue even with the same contact but never knew why,  I just realized that it might be due to me being out of range for data but still in range for basic cell signal"
93,Tldr
94,i turn off the ‚Äúsend as sms‚Äù to avoid getting accidentally charged for texting when i‚Äôm out of network coverage
95,I thought it meant the husband screwed her ex for an iPhone
96,"On an iPhone:
- Green: SMS text message
- Blue: iMessage (text message to another iPhone). They are different color as I messages can even go over Wi-Fi and there‚Äôs additional functionality with iMessaging in general"
97,Yah
98,Edited cuz am dum
99,yea it happens. can be disabled too if they disable the ‚Äúsend as sms‚Äù in settings. it can add up to some surprise sms charges when the network goes out unexpectedly lol
100,"Blue = iMessage, Green = Standard SMS message

Messages from an iPhone can be either blue or green,
Messages from an android are always green

Message in the pic is blue + being sent from a phone number so it must be from an iPhone"
