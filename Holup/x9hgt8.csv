1,"Reread Abe’s 13th Amendment some time.     


‘The Thirteenth Amendment (Amendment XIII) to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.’"
2,Why would I want to do that?
3,I didn't say anything about slavery or involuntary servitude. So the 13th amendment doesn't matter here.
4,It’s not illegal to buy or sell people.  Just requires certain legal documents.
5,"Slaves are still traded and bartered in the system and shipped.     Tax Payer owned and Private prisons for instance.  


You just need proper paper work."
6,"If so, what certain legal documents do you need and who can get those documents? Be specific. 

The buying and selling of people is human trafficking and human trafficking is absolutely illegal."
7,"You're the only one talking about slaves, for some reason. I'm talking about human trafficking. Like I said before. And human trafficking is still very much illegal. I think you're getting criminals confused with slaves. 

I do agree that slaves were prisoners that were bought and sold, but prisoners aren't slaves and were not bought or sold. Prisoners are people that were charged and convicted of committing crimes, crimes like human trafficking, which is still illegal no matter how many times you bring up slaves and paperwork."
8,Private Prison systems have all the details if you want to buy and sell humans as property
9,"Hence Abe ending slavery,  except if they are convicted of a crime.    Then they go to the farm."
10,"Again, you're getting slaves and criminals mixed up. 

If a warden walked down the street buying people from other people to put in his prison, he would get charged with human trafficking, which is illegal, and would end up in prison. As a prisoner. Not as a slave. But as a  criminal, because he committed a crime. (Human trafficking)"
11,They will revoke you on the spot is you use the S word.    They are “inmates” now.
12,"No, they go to prison. Because they were convicted of doing something that was illegal, like human trafficking. Or buying and selling people. Which is still illegal, even though you don't seem to understand that."
13,"Then the US constitution is wrong and slaves/convicts are not the same things.  

Because according to US Supreme Law,  they are both property."
14,You mean slave? Like the word you've (incorrectly)used 20 times so far ?
15,"I don't think criminals are considered property but even if they were, just because they are both property, that doesn't mean they are the same. Both my truck and my  socks are my property. Using your logic, that would mean they are both trucks or they are both socks. Clearly they are two different things. Clearly to me at least. 


Show me the definition of the word slave that mentions convict or vise versa and I'll agree with you."
