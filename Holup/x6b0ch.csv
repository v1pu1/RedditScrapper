1,I don't get it
2,"I think the joke here is that there are often candle marches for women who are raped and killed. is he saying he might kill her during ""rough sex""? is that the joke?"
3,Candle marches? As in a candle lit vigil?
4,.... I don't get it...
5,Not sooo rough i guess
6,"Most of you guys didn’t even get the joke, you just saw rough sex and upvoted"
7,See that is what we call classy
8,the most realest hol' up post
9,"She said she liked being dominated, then asked if he was into it. He said “sorry” as in “NO” but then went on to use extreme hyperbole to illustrate how broad and dark the definition of “rough sex/domination” could be depending upon who you ask. Clearly she didn’t mean that she wanted to die. His response highlighted that you probably want to be very specific when asking if someone is into rough sex to make sure you’re taking about the same thing. One wouldn’t want to be wrong about sharing that definition especially if it could mean being “dead wrong” definitely a Hol up"
10,Fake profile regardless. Big L.
11,What kinda name is that
12,I’m so confused by this lol
13,I thought that name said grandma at first.
14,"Omg lol seriously... The comments... No rough sex isn't rape, rape fantasy rollplay isn't rape, like how fucking vannila is this  sub... what is rape is reading the comments about it being rape because it's clearly a well played joke that a girl that likes rough sex is probably gonna get turned on by both humour And the thoughts of possibly getting the best dicking she ever imagined. Cause clearly guy is a smooth clever confidant son of a gun that probably isn't concerned one fuck about impressing.. he knows he is impressive. He's a fucking gigachad."

22,"Speaking of domination, in tf2 i had like 7 dominations at once"
23,"Me reading this at first glance: ?

Me reading it again: SHIIIIIIIIIIII 💀"
24,Delhi reference💀
25,Oh shit

27,I'm too scared to even say anything here. But I'll say that I'm scarred.
28,Ops deleted.
29,hahha imma r*pe you during rough sex hahaha (I have a dark sense of humor)
30,"Women who are raped and killed often get candlelit vigils.

This is a degree of ""hol' up"" that might be too spicy even for this place."
31,Me neither
32,"She's talking about rough sex
When kills the girl later
And makes everyone do candle marches in her name"
33,[deleted]
34,I second this
35,"i think this is the only way to explain it, so yeah probably"
36,[removed]
37,I also didn’t get it until I read some people explaining it and I’m fucking glad I didn’t get it
38,"Watch ""Gone Girl"" you'll see a great movie with an example."

42,well it is certainly \*obscure\* to see the umber of people not getting it ;).
43,If this was you OP where do you find Garima who likes rough sex?
44,I think he was insinuating murder
45,"Holy shit, definitely agreed. This is by far the most hardcore hol up Ive ever seen"
46,Great explanation
47,Ohhhhh now i get it 0_0
48,Are candle lit vigils those things on the sidewalks with all those Jesus candles?? I those were for people that died in a shooting or car crash
49,holy moly fuck
50,me neither
51,"i think i had a stroke reading this, can someone please reword what he said"
52,If you got to explain it. It’s not funny.
53,Not that humourus if you'd ask me
54,Exactly.
55,My friend from high school is in that movie :D
56,I have seen Gone girl. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO CONFUSED IN MY LIFE AS RIGHT NOW
57,Hol up
58,"No, they’re when people all gather (typically to remember/ mourn someone) and each person holds a candle- the meaning of vigil is related to guard/ watch"
59,"[the hardest choice require the strongest wills]
me neither"
60,If he had tough sex with her she'll die. Then he won't like the candle marches in her name
61,Rough sex = rape
62,Thank you I'll keep this in mind.
63,Nice
64,And a friend of mine is not in that movie
65,They have a candlelight vigil for the missing wife.
66,Me neither
67,Thank you..
68,Ok but she ran away. Is that the joke?
69,Me neither
70,"No, the joke is that when you get murdered people hold a candlelit vigil for you. The poster in the photo was basically exagerrating saying that rough sex will end with someone getting killed."
