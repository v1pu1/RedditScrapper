3,"Imagine the fear of having it go silent, trying to phone them, then Emergency Services and explain you're not exactly sure of where they are or what has happened, but you know they're flat lining.... Only to turn out, they were just doing the dishes with some music on and missed your calls."
4,Tbf my partner would be pretty shocked at how fast my resting rate is

16,Marcus are you dead?
17,"I hear no heartbeats, friends"
18,"When these came out, I wanted a pair. I got on the waiting list and waited over a year. I thought it was set up so that you could send your heartbeat to your SO to let them know you were thinking of them. When I realized it was instead set up for your SO to sample your heartbeat and you don't even know it. I told them that was mad creepy and if they changed it the first way instead I would buy. No deal. Creepy version only."
19,"""Calm down Honey, or you gonna wake up ur sister"""

77,Masturbation can prevent prostate cancer. So there you have it. You should indulge sometimes for your own health
78,I've been known to dabble in fear-mongering.
79,"So a common reason for removing your ring, is doing the dishes (by hand). This is due to people worrying over tarnishing the ring in the dishwater, it sliding off and losing it, and also the catching of bacteria and other grime between your ring and your finger. It's so common, is used quite often as a TV trope."
