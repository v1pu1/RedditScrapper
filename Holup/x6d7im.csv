2,Bury them vertically? Goddammit now I need to go get my spade...
3,"Also, do not a use a new shovel as the paint deposits in the ground can be identified and will help narrow the suspects."
4,What about the yoghurt up the arse bit though?

6,I always wondered why someone wouldn‚Äôt dig the hole before killing someone then you aren‚Äôt rushed & would be able to dig a deep hole. If someone spots you then you just look weird & you can start over elsewhere.

11,"The dead animal-thing is not true, as police dogs are trained to find human bodies and will keep searching that spot for corpses"
12,"I feel like if searchers were to find a buried animal body they would be fairly suspicious of the coincidence, and check if the earth below is also suspiciously loose"

16,"I work with dogs, they can identify the difference between dead things by scent. If a human cadaver dog is hitting on a location and you dig up a dead animal you would keep digging because the dog would continue to signal on the spot that you need to dig."
17,Oddly specific... but very interesting.
18,I‚Äôll just dig this 10 foot vertical hole

21,"Violent crime investigator here. It's true, if we are searching for a body in an area we are relatively sure it could have been dumped, and find a fresh grave with an animal in it, we are 100% not looking any further or thinking it's suspicious or anything."

29,"Shopping list, boys. 

* 55 gallon steel drum
* At least 7lbs of lye. Granular works best as it's undiluted. 
* Water
* Optional: One of those turkey deep fryer burner things

If using a burner, place drum on burner first. Then, place body in drum (dismember if needed to make it fit). Add lye and water. Mix and pour into drum until body is submerged. Place lid on drum. If not using the burner, this can be set aside somewhere private, or buried. If using a burner, bring the solution inside to a simmer and then let it cook. The heat will speed up the caustic action of the lye and dissolve the body that much faster. 

There's dozens if not hundreds of articles about this. Probably not best for being in the suburbs, but if you've got large land and spaced out neighbors, like a farm or even a cabin in the woods, then there's very little to stop you. 

Lye can be found at any hardware store in the plumbing section. It's a very common drain cleaner. Why? Because it dissolves organic material... Shit, hair, cotton/paper, etc."
30,Bro i didn't know I can get a lot of likes from the shit I do everyday
31,"""Remove"" the hands and teethü§Æ"
32,"I‚Äôll have to save this, for research purposes."
33,You can also plant some endangered plants above yhe dead animal so it is illegal to dig up
34,Or just feed the body to pigs. That works just as good.
35,"This is dog shit advice. The more elaborate your plan the more errors you make and the easier it is to find your fuck up. Your gonna lose a tooth somewhere, you're gonna leave DNA somewhere. The yogurt thing doesn't do anything."
36,"This fails to consider dna testing. Finger prints and dental records are famously inconsistent when it comes to identification. There are many cases where dental records were used to convict innocent people only for them to be exonerated with dna evidence. 

Basically, if any piece of the body can be found, they will be able to match that to the missing person. Even if they don't have another dna sample to match it too, they can still use relatives of the missing person to identify their genetic relationship and confirm that it was them."
37,Penguins rape way more than humans ever will
38,Just give ole Bricktop a call and see if his 16pigs are hungry
39,Why kill an animal just to bury it on top of it. My conscience won't allow it.
40,"Some stuff sounds smart but is dumb and has the opposite affect.
1. You cant dig a vertical hole for a body obviously
2. If you put a dead animal on top, you will lure the dogs super fast to your spot for no reason. They notice someone just recently placed it there and See the moved earth and get suspicious.
3. That Joghurt will do absolutely nothing obviously.
4  has he never heard of DNA identification?!?!?"
41,Y‚Äôall are noobs obvi. All you gotta do is stuff them in a ceramic tub. Then torch the bones to dust with a large propane torch. After mix the ashes with some hersheys syrup and milk. Down the hatch. Maybe save some of the burnt remains to snort for a little pick me up. As this whole process takes awhile.
42,"I would very much like to know how you would dig a hole atleast 10 ft deep without distrubing 6 ft long. Frankly, this seems to be made by an amateur. 

Simple is best, dismember and put in conc HCl vat and bury that in concrete foundation beneath a statue"
43,"Thank you for the advice, I'll take it all into consideration next time."
44,"The best way is to also remove your teeth and hands so they can‚Äôt identify you, either."
45,Actually the animal thing doesn‚Äôt work. Cadaver dogs are trained to recognize the scent of decaying human matter and human blood while ignoring other decaying animals. Dogs have incredibly strong noses and they won‚Äôt be fooled by that kind of nonsense.
46,Anyone who has dug up ground knows it's not an easy thing to do as shown in movies. Highly dependent on the type of ground.
47,"cut off all finger tips

rip out teeth

burn the corpse

sweep up ashen remains

bury ashen remains in a few random spots in the middle of nowhere. 

burnt bones don't smell like a rotting corpse.. so dogs wont search for them (i'd guess)

also i'd add, don't throw the corpse into the ocean. This is what Peter Madsen did (the submarine killer) and the police used special trained dogs to sniff out the location of the corpse even though it was put into plastic bags and weighted with something, so it was at the bottom of the ocean"
48,"Make sure to wet the ground you bury as well. Actually, flood it a bit before putting the dirt back on. Bodies decompose 4 times as fast in water than on land"
49,"""remove the teeth and hands"" okay but leave the face, right? ""Damn, he's got no teeth or hands but it sure does look like Steve..."""
50,"That's fucking disgusting.

*Saves image*"
51,"I got the exact same information from a friend who is a police officer.

Other ways he said about how to get away with murder:

1: Either plant endangered plants (making it illegal to dig there).

2: Place a shed/small building on top (making it harder to get to the body).

3: Just place it in a random spot with no plants (the nitrogen from the decomposing body will make any plants grow more than in the surrounding area - yes I know it goes against the first bit about endangered plants).

4: If you can get a farmer's help/you are a farmer, then you can bury the body vertically in one of the farmer's fields then get the farmer to plough the field, meaning that any disturbed ground from where you dug would be covered by the whole field having disturbed soil.

5: Give the police an anonymous tip about where a body is (obviously before you bury the person you killed) then they'll dig up the ground searching for a body, they won't find it so they'll think it's a false tip. You then go to the same place and bury the body there, meaning that the disturbed topsoil isn't suspicious.

He also said that there was someone he knew (a farmer) who killed his wife and followed the advice in 4 and 2 (in that order) and was only caught because he was talking about it in the pub with the police officer when he was drunk. The police officer had given him that advice as well."
52,Not my proudest fap
53,"The best way to hide a body is to feed them to pigs. Make sure you starve them for Atleast 20 to 24hrs. And Make sure you remove all the teeth because sometimes pigs cannot digest teeth & also it can tear there inner organs. About 30 to 40hrs 20 pigs (the more number of pigs the better) can eat everything the best part is you dont have remove the dead body clothes you just through them to pigs. Once the digested, look for small bones in there poo. Take them burn it untill it is turned into ashes. Collect all the poo & through it in your farm land or through it the near by lake.

Bonus feature :-  You dont have to chopp the body just through them to pigs."
54,This isn‚Äôt common knowledge???
55,Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to decompose a body in acid like Walter and Jesse did?
56,We have experienced killers on reddit
57,"In some countries you can't dig under a plant. So if you plant something over the dead body and if the body is under a certain depth, it's not yours"
58,Lemme just save dis

60,"I tell one guy my secret and this motherfucker posts it all over the internet!

What a dick"
61,"Yeah just one problem, animals just don't get buried in the woods. They get eaten an bones scatter a little bit and then sink into the ground. If I found a whole skeleton about 12"" underground you bet your ass I'd dig further. 

Now bury it in somebody's backyard and it's an other story but I feel like this could be difficult. 

A good swamp and lye are all you need."
62,I know that the freezing temperature of cum is -196 celsius
63,ahhh i'm so glad we got the luxury of gators down here in the swamps. all that shit is too much work
64,"Well if you know this,it's probably already obsolete."
65,"Oh yeah, I have a Google Doc for this. It's a bit more complete than this though. Here it is verbatim:

>***FOR LEGAL REASONS THIS IS A JOKE***

>Get a waterproof sleeping bag and bury the person head first feet up. Pull out the teeth, clip off the fingertips and toes and put them in a 2L bottle of coke and stick it at the bottom with the head. Put yogurt in the anus to help decompose it faster. As the body decomposes the liquids of delicious human goo will condense at the bottom of the bag(in the head, making facial recognition impossible without computer reconstruction) and the coke will degrade the finger tips/toes and teeth making identity by fingerprints and dental records impossible. After a while the bottle of coke will explode from pressure built up by the fluids from the body parts and further degrade the body because of liquidation, even the bones will eventually get warped because of the coke. Nothing will leak out because you're using a waterproof sleeping bag and after a few weeks of decomp the entire body will be a gooey pile of human goo at the bottom of a small sleeping bag and as this all happens the dirt will slowly sink making the hole look natural because it will remove any marks that it was dug. Then put a layer of dirt ~1 foot tall above it. Bury a dead animal above it. Put the rest of the dirt above it, like you would normally bury a body. Then plant a plant above the animal corpse, preferably a plant natural to that area, as to not look suspicious, or an endangered plant. Preferably both though, like a cactus the middle of the desert in Arizona or New Mexico."
66,"Also, bury them naked and in a burlap sack filled with earthworms, and since this is the planning stage, plant a protected species of plant life on top of the burial sight as a way of both disguising the digging and further slowing the discovery process.

And come on, there ain't no way I'm doing the yogurt thing. Damn."
67,"If you bury them vertically,  they will then have an understanding.."
68,"Cadaver dogs are trained only to detect the scent of HUMAN remains. Another animal buried on top will not work. They don‚Äôt signal for dead animals, only dead humans. They would just keep digging until they found what was making the dog alert and keep giving it chances to signal to verify it was not a false positive."
69,"Yeah that might work in the 1950‚Äôs before DNA, but there are many more ways to identify someone other than teeth and fingerprints."
70,"Average redditor moment : dig 6 ft vertical hole..???? 

This man has never held a spade/shovel in his life. Also, putting a wild animal on top? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard... Where are you gonna get a whole ass deer or some shit? Go hunting right after you murder them? And what would they think when they dig up a freshly killed deer? Who the fuck buries deer or other hunt? 

If you kill someone the only feasible options for the average joe is to cremate the body or dump it into a large body of water (weighted down and sealed of course)."
71,"Ok, followed it. Now what will I do with the hands and teeth here?
Also neighbour is asking about his dog. What should I say?"
72,"Posted this before, but here‚Äôs more info:

Before we begin, what state is the body in? How were they killed, is it in one piece, how big is it, what age? All are important questions we will need to have answered when the time comes to properly get rid of it. For this method I will assume it is an average sized adult who is in one piece.

Before we start on the actual disposal though, we must ensure that no one knows about it. Where were they killed? Did anyone witness it? What about cameras? You will also need to consider your alibi, and know that you may well be asked questions if you were a close friend or family member, or were the last person to see them. If you are certain that there is no way the killing can be traced to you, and I mean 100% certain, then and only then can you actually dispose of it.

First of all, a body is quite conspicuous, so we will need to get rid of the solid, decomposing mass that may attract unwanted attention from police or other law enforcement agencies. Use a strong base such as bleach or sodium hydroxide to melt it down. This will cause the body to become a liquid-like substance which is easier to dispose of. You need to use an alkali instead of an acid because they are a lot easier to acquire, although don‚Äôt buy too much of it at the same time sans try to use cash so you can‚Äôt be traced as easily.

At this point you will be left with several gallons of human juice. If you live in a rural area or grow crops, it can quite easily make good fertiliser, so sprinkle it sparingly over any plants that require nutrition though. Ensure you conspicuously buy regular fertiliser though so people aren‚Äôt suspicious if your plants suddenly grow. If not, the liquid could be sprinkled sparingly in any non-urban area, making sure not too much goes in one area, as that will cause a huge growth of plants which is quite suspicious.

If you are unable to melt it down, then it can be fed to pigs who will eat everything but the teeth which can generally be disposed of in a regular bin. If you cannot feed it to pigs then you may just have to dice it up and bury it over a wide area, making sure to spread fertiliser around so any plants that grow from the nitrates and phosphates in the decomposing body don‚Äôt look out of place.

If you absolutely have to bury it in one piece, perhaps due to time constraints, then go to an area far from your house. Drive there, but do t speed or break any traffic laws. If pulled over by the police, act casual, be confident and do as they say. Remember in some places they cannot search your car without a warrant. When you get to your destination, collect the large quantities of fertiliser you have hidden there and cover a wide area with it. Then, dig at least 5m down and bury the body in the foetal position. If Rigor Mortis doesn‚Äôt allow this, then bury it standing up. You want to avoid an area the size of a traditional grave that can be spotted with a helicopter. After that, fill in around 2 more metres of dirt, then bury a dead mammal such as a deer or fox. Fill in the rest of the hole, then disturb the dirt around it in a wide area so the dig area doesn‚Äôt look out of place.

If you cannot drive somewhere, then repeat these steps in a garden or nearby, secluded park. If you don‚Äôt even have enough time for all that, then you may be left with having to dice up the body and dispose of it slowly, keeping the remainder frozen until it is all gone.

Or at least all that‚Äôs what a friend told me"
73,"This is dumb. If you're already cutting body parts off, dismember the entire thing. If you have the money, buy a deep freezer. You can get a small used one for less than. 100 bucks. Then you slowly dissolve the parts in a 7 gallon bucket with muriatic acid over a few days. 

After each time you neutralize the acid with baking soda and pour it down the drain (it's basically salt water and people juice at this point) 

There will probably be bits left so put a strainer over the drain,  put the bits in a zip lock and use them for bait, ot just throw them in a pond or something. 

The hardest part is the torso because it's not going to fit in the bucket and ""opening"" it up is going to be messy and smelly. So you're going to have to get more buckets. 3 or 4 will do. You stack those in the tub near the drain. You get at the body however you like, when you have enough chunks to halfway fill the bucket, you put that bucket on the opposite end of the tub and scoop the chunks into it. 

You keep doing that disassembly line shit until all of your buckets are full. Pour the acid in, wait, pour, rinse. Focus on ONE area to clean each day ,and clean the fuck out of it. Then do it again. Recycle the buckets ( there isn't any DNA on it but imagine accidentally using that shit to rinse your peach harvest...gross)

If you don't have time for all of this then you shouldn't be killing people,  now should you? Failing to plan is a plan to fail. 

Go get em, tiger!"
