4,"Taken way out of context? Only one student is black, the other student to the left looks Indian/middle eastern, the guy on the right is white and the lady on far the left looks like someone from Eastern Europe. Seems like some students on a field trip for agricultural study. Maybe they majored in agrarian studies?"
5,Damn these dude be willing to do anything for that asianussy....
6,Let’s ignore the 2 white people
7,The world is getting worse and worse....
8,america to china be like: youre allrite sonny boy
9,"I know I’m not supposed to take this seriously…but does the idea of a black student in China hold the same baggage as the idea of a black student in America? Do the same cultural standards actually cross over? Are these black Americans learning in China, or are these black Chinese people going through this? I’m confused."
10,whAT??? that made me choke on my smoke holy shit
11,Bruh why are we moaning about the west
12,ah jesus not again
13,"Everyone from the States .. black people you say, cotton fields.. somebody call the NAACP."
14,Way to create a fake headline
15,Source
16,"Ayo China is doing that one money generating glitch that was really popular back in the 19th century on all servers. I thought they patched it in the 21st century update, but I guess as always someone found another loophole in the game files."
17,You see it's evolving just backwards.
18,Reminds me of the video where someone tells the story of the most racist field trip he went to
19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PToqVW4n86U

31,Why sign up for that class?
32,"""We've been doing it ourselves upto this point, but history says you guys have an inherent talent for it..here just try it""--china"

41,Don't give them anymore ideas
42,"Israel is doing Apartheid. China is committing genocide against Muslims. 

There practically is a holocaust currently happening against Palestinians and Uighur Muslims in China"
43,Pakistan has crazy slave rules. They call it something else though.
44,"America never stoped with the slavery either. They enshrined it in their constitution in fact. And so, today, a country with 5% of the worlds population has 25% of the worlds jailed population. I wonder why :]"
45,Israel
46,"Don't know, but Isreal definitely switched sides for this round. No take backs Palestine!"
47,Em... Russia... Against Ukrain... Em basically saying it's cleansing or purging for them.
48,They should ask the twitterati to cancel the Chinese government.
49,"Again, it never stopped."
50,![gif](giphy|YoWOIjnXT1NKIbFP9H|downsized)
51,It’s Israel that’s doing apartheid two
52,"What Redditors need to understand is that slaves picking cotton is a US thing, not a Chinese thing. Most Chinese people probably don't even know about Lincoln and the emancipation.

What happened here is most likely just foreign students being taught normal farming stuff and an American thinking he can publish this for easy internet points."
53,typical disinformation to make sensation and isn't it general interest work?
54,It's a Chinese bot! /s
55,Exactly no link to source and I’m 90% sure the people here mouthing off didn’t even try finding the article for context.
56,Like brutally push over old asian men and women? Or like kick old asian women in the face? The sky’s the limit my boy.
57,the woman seems to be having the time of her life
58,What you mean exactly? I'm sure there are people with darker skin learning in Chinese schools but I don't think they will have the same standards.... I mean it's China
59,wtaf nooooo
60,They added a new expansion pack with south Asian and Caucasian playable characters too
61,"How have I not seen this? Well, thank you for this gem anyway; absolutely hilarious!! Who is that guy??"
62,Here's the [link](https://youtu.be/Oomlb9xm-YQ)
63,Lmao I have that video saved. Hilarious in a wtf kind of way
64,"As long as they don’t whip it out, eh who am I kidding this is still pretty bad."
65,[Too late.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037)
66,It really show how people are today that I completely forgot about an entire fucking genocide happening
67,"Thing is we don’t actually have real solid evidence for a genocide. The most we get to firmly confirm would be brainwashing and cultural genocide but an actual genocide of the Uigher population is hard to really prove. Of course there’s the more passive way of extermination such as giving them as hard of a time as possible to make children so their population would drop incredibly fast, but that would be pretty hard to find solid evidence for too. Personally speaking, the passive genocide and brainwashing seems like the most probable method in their camps."
68,But why muslims not getting all terroristic on china?
69,"No more like willing to go back into slavery just to get some asianussy....

*Dear reddit please don't burn me at the stake, it's a joke*"
70,It reminds her of grandma
71,"From what I learned after I wrote my comment, it seems that around 8% of the Chinese population would be descendants of Africa proper. China had actual African slaves. I just don’t know if racism and oppression was the same historically for China as it was in the US. Telling someone who is black to pick cotton would be inflammatory in America, but maybe it wasn’t the same in China. I can’t be sure, not much information about it on Google. Wouldn’t even know the right keywords to use to find such information, really. 

From an American perspective, getting black people to pick cotton is a call back to one of the darkest parts of our history. I don’t think or know if such a perspective exists in China. That’s what I meant."
72,"Thanks, kind stranger"
73,Damn
74,You guys are fucking insane.
75,"That's because it involves Muslims, had it been Israel, the whole world would have gone off the rockers. Just look at Ukraine. My thoughts and prayers are with them but their president supports what Israel is doing in Palestine."
76,">  Personally speaking, the passive genocide and brainwashing seems like the most probable method in their camps.

Totally...except the forced sterilization of people in those camps."
77,What the fuck are you talking about?
78,"It was Israel in the 1970's you realize the entire reason Israel is in that territory in the first place is because they were invaded by Muslim countries that were attempting to eradicate them. 


They just happened to win."
79,If china is genocide Muslims why they not jihading on china?
80,You do realize they came as fucking refugees right? And then took over the land of the people who were kind enough to let them in
81,"Kind enough? Really??

Just how far back are we going to go with this?


Palestine was owned by the British land was no one's to take in the 20th century, in 1947 Britain was going to grand Palestine self rule and split it and Israel into 2 separate states.

Days after Israel was formed it was invaded by several Muslim countries intent on extermination of the Jews in Israel. The Arabs lost. 


They tried again in 1967 to destroy Israel and lost. 


They tried yet again in 1973 and lost. 


Once you attack and lose that many times it's pretty hard to expect the victor to grant you much leeway..."
82,"Ah yes, the kind people who let them in."
