11,"If you check YouTube, the NBC coverage (during the Today show, I believe) actually shows a helicopter shot of the plane approaching. The switch to a different camera (the other side of the building from this, concentrating on the first tower struck), and you see the second tower hit.

There's a lady speaking on the phone at the time, and after a delay, she mentions an explosion, and it takes a call for a replay for everyone to realize that passenger jet they had glimpsed before had just gone through the second tower ON PURPOSE.

That shot literally captures the moment everyone realized these were deliberate acts, not an accident (as had been speculated about)."

21,Agreed.

23,"You say that, yet in my 23 years of life I've heard more jokes about that national tragedy than even Pearl Harbor. It's a perspective thing, people about my age and younger don't know what the ""world before 9/11"" was like so it's just a date in the history books to those that don't care to learn about it, which is most. I never saw the news in school, and I always said the pledge every day, but nobody questioned why. Don't assume your experience is universal about anything or you'll seem like a fool"
24,Essentially was a bomb…with wings.
25,r/woooosh
26," 1 year isn't old, for example-: u consider a 1 year old baby new or old. I consider it over 18 years old but normal people consider it new"
27,"Sure, as long as you are not the victim. Or a relative."
28,">	Don’t assume your experience is universal about anything or you’ll seem like a fool

You just did.

I was your age when it happened and I don’t live in NY or even in the US, but it was a profoundly shocking experience.

In theory one should be able to make fun of everything, and it is actually an important part of processing trauma.

In this case, it’s just very bad taste because so many died on, after and because of 9/11. And because lots of people making fun of it are wet behind their ears.

At 23, you believe you rule the world. Wait a few years and you’ll understand that at 23 you didn’t know shit."
29,Well in that case go eat your 1 year old sandwich and tell me it tastes brand new.
30,"Ya got me there, but my point still stands"
31,It still new for me personally I would eat it
32,"So does mine.

Not being directly touched by an event (and that’s hardly accurate because the world has changed profoundly, for the worse, after 9/11) does not give anyone the right to behave disrespectfully."
