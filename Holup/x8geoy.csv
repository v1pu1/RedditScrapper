1,So I‚Äôve never actually had sex with my wife?
2,Explain why my chair still smells like ass after sitting in it without showering for 2 weeks?
3,Goodbye condoms!!
4,Meaning no one has ever touched grass
5,"""Technically"" touching is when the atoms are so close that they start to repel each other\*"
6,Your sibling saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not touching you‚Äù is actually correct
7,If atoms dont touch eachother then how tf do you get stabbed?
8,Son of a bitch. Magicians really are out here levitating and we thought they were full of it.
9,It was the virtual photons mediating the electromagnetic force that raped them
10,This is why I never use lubrication.
11,"Wooow, hot take from a rapey person"
12,So I can suck dick without being gay?
13,"The sensation of touch is the feeling of atoms repelling each other. So yes, you are touching stuff."
14,Not touching can‚Äôt get back
15,"No no, he's got a point"
16,*Technically*
17,The force field made me cum
18,"By the dent that my fat ass leaves on my couch I would say that distance is very, very small"
19,"okay okay, so...

the modern definition of touch is physically interact, so we do technically touch things..."
20,"So feeling is just an illusion?  *Enter existential crisis"""
21,So does this mean a sperm and an ovum are just responding to each others presence rather than physically integrating into one thing?
22,"Technically we've never actually felt the touch of another human being, simply the radiation of heat from their body . üôÉ"
23,Faisal chutya
24,Someone educate this fool about AT fields.
25,So officer i did not punch that kid.
26,So no officer i never punched that kid
27,Saturo Gojo has entered the chat
28,So technically the only time people actually touch is when a child is made since a male cell and female cell become something new when they're put together.
29,Neither have I.
30,"No, but i have ‚Äî she really is quite lovely."
31,Figures.
32,"Sadly, no... üòî"
33,I also haven't had sex with your wife
34,"Not with that attitude!

Now get back in there and give her the ole College try!"
35,That's because you're a redditor
36,Don't worry buddy. I also never had sex with your wife.
37,Ass juice is floating above it
38,I want an explanation as to how you recognize that smellü´•
39, Negative and positive charges hold atoms in the vicinity
40,Fuck! And I thought I was better than you people.
41,"Because the force still interacts with them, it‚Äôs like a magnet, it‚Äôs pushing your skin apart, but at such a neglible distance you might as well get stabbed, it‚Äôs really a non point, at a certain level nothing is held together, just bond together, so a knife is effectively splitting the bonds in your skin to cut you"
42,The knife is magic
43,Neither have I.
44,Your or his?
45,I give you two my best wishes
46,The real question is how have you been a human being this long and not know what ass smells like?
47,"Hey hey listen

My parents like gardening and I help them when I'm able to

I've gotten very close to grass"
48,"Huh, and what about separating limbs? Would it work in the same way? Maybe a faster way? For no particular reason"
49,Not yet.
50,his ofc
51,"Ya pretty much, your body is mad up of cells which are made up of atoms, the knife would split the atomic bonds, sometimes going through cells, and your arm would fall off, that‚Äôs why doctors use obsidian for scalpels it so precise they can cut a lot easier"
52,OUR wife
53,Wait is the obsidian scalpel true?
54,Lol @obsidian... Boy people are gullible...
55,"Yep, only in prestigious hospitals tho and for really difficult surgeries, obsidian is incredibly fragile, and can break off, but it‚Äôs thin enough that incisions made with it don‚Äôt scar as much"
56,https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/health/surgery-scalpels-obsidian
57,"Damm, that's so cool! I had no clue, thanks for sharing"
58,"I stand corrected, good on you sir"
