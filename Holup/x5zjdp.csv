5,"I used to work in an office of cubicles. Four or five times a year an office chair would give up the ghost under different heavy coworkers. The chair piston would give out or the seat will strip out the screws from them sitting on the front edge of the seat. Then there would be an expedition to go steal a suitable chair from a vacant cubicle while hollering that the chairs are cheap trash. One lady has broken three chairs over the years. As she was rolling her broken chair away to go find a new one, a coworker ran over and laid the chair in it's side on the floor. He whipped out his phone and stepped back to take a picture. ""Put your foot up on it! We need to start documenting your kills!"" He got wrote up, but everyone laughed."
