23,It's just a joke lol
24,"Where is the joke man, what you said is just a statement"
25,Why are you taking this so seriously? For Pete's sake this is a cute and funny comic.
26,"I wasn't serious until you said it was a joke, which it wasn't"
27,"No, you were serious since you first responded to me...

Point is, this is a cute and funny comic. Did you think, while ignoring the spirit of things, that I was trying to say there's some sort of sexual supremacy?

I'm wise enough to know having a superiority complex about that would be really absurd.

Too bad, my joke missed its mark, because I can't make the tone *sound* silly in writing."
28,"I was half serious tbh. And if you want to sound silly, why would you just state their opinion? If someone said ""Flat earth theory is right"", even in a silly voice, it wouldn't be a joke.

It would be a joke if it was an exaggeration, like ""What do you mean, obviously our planet being a disk on a freaking jetpack that accelerates upwards makes more sense."""
29,"Dude, I don't believe your point applies to me because you thought I was stating their opinion.

I replied to their absurd question with a more absurd answer, which is exaggerating.

Now, I'm gonna get over this, because I don't need to explain myself any more for your obstinate lecturing."
