0,I have gotten in touch with KSI and he has acknowledged this post so he will no longer be fighting Gib. Thank you Adamc5110.
1,Bro begging through a Reddit post lmao
2,I agree cause they r friends
3,Its a sport mate no need for a beef to fight gib just pure skill and let the best win . No hate.
4,"wow i know that people say this sub is filled with kids, but i thought it was a joke..."
5,This has to be the cringiest post on this sub on god. Why you begging on a Reddit post bro chill out 💀
6,"Idk why he said that stupid shit, maybe he had a load of adrenaline in that moment and most likely just wanted to say McBroom. Or he expects Gib to lose, making it Austin guaranteed, but that’s just mean. So I hope its the first option I said."
7,"Why are KSI fanbois so cringe💀proper crying on a post ""PLS JJ DONT FIGHT HIM"", like stfu"
8,"""are you a Therapist?"""
9,Unless it's like sensei and Kenny i don't want it but knowing gib and jj no way they're like sensei or kenny
10,"He should fight an actual Pro Boxer (not Pineda) 
I want that Tommy Fury fight because it will definitively show where JJ is at compared to Jake."
11,I think austin might win tbh plus it sets up the ksi vs mcbroom fight anyways
12,I’d see Gib vs KSI more as friendly competition. Gib would give JJ the most pressure of anyone and would test JJ’s technique properly
13,KSI won’t fight either because gibs a friend and the event itself will flop and no one will eye mcbroom as a money fight when there’s better options
14,"Austin could win this one, KSI should fight whoever will give him a challenge with the only exception being his blood brother"
15,Ngl KSI vs Gib is a really good fight
16,I agree…😣 Please don’t fight Gib!!…( ever!!) 😕
17,when's the fight?
18,He wouldn’t fight Gib. He was saying he would fight the winner if Austin won
19,Friendly reminder that Gib and Jj are both adults who can make their own decisions.
20,"why fight mcbroom, the guy that could barely pay the fighters in his last event? (if he even did)"
21,Who are you talking to mate?
22,Well how the fuck else is he gonna prove to everyone he’s on Jake’s level if not better???!
23,"On one hand I would like to see it since Gib is up there at the best YouTube boxers and if JJ was to win against him he would prove a lot of people wrong. On the other hand, we have more British influencer boxers at the top if they stay teammates"
24,Can people please like this i need karma
25,"thanks to Adamx5110, KSI is no longer willing to fight Gib"
26,This must mean he thinks mcbroom will win
27,"Now id Gib was not friends with Jj and they had a tiny bit of beef, yall would say if Gib wins fight him"
28,Mr. Gibbs from Pirates of the Caribbean
29,it aint that deep bruh. people can still have a boxing match and be friends simultaneously. the only ‘downside’ is that the (most of the time) fake beef to promote fights wont work if gib and jj fight
30,"Tbh I don’t see him benefiting anything.

If he wins - Jake has already beaten him, quite easily may I add. 

If he loses - the fight with Jake would probably be cancelled because if Jakes ego & he’ll say shit like you’re not on my level."
31,Minafyusbgdyugfuheijhrfgyhiudijsdef
32,it would be just like craford vs poriter both having full respect for eatch other but putting everything on the line
33,Gib not winning so Idm
34,BAHAHAHA🤣🤣
35,I got Austin winning this fight easily
36,"He is a, muslim"
37,They’re not fighting each other
38,"Boxing is a sport not a drama club, they can fight without beef."
39,Mcbroom burner account
40,If they're challenges for each other then they should fight. Either way JJ will believe he can knock them both out.
41,ruin gib
42,Hes not fighting gib though he said he wants the winner. He basically wants Austin but hes not beating gib so he saying if you beat gib you fight me
43,Who are you talking to?
44,No hate to gib but he would lose
45,Ye wtf jj
46,I don’t see gib winning
47,gib with northodox fighting style
48,Tag team mcbroom and make it 0-2
49,Obviously he’s not gonna fight Gib. Why would he box his mate.
50,"Gib and JJ can still fight even in the ring, there doesn’t have to be beef, at least not real beef anyway, most of it’s fake"
51,Ngl thaught it said gib vs mushroom
52,🗣🗣
53,No I wanna see that fight
54,"The subreddit is so dead with dumb posts like these, I wish the memes and creative posts come back."
55,"Tbh I have mcbroom winning, we know he won’t let Gib take a decision so gib can’t let it be close, and from what we’ve seen he doesn’t have KO or TKO power, which Austin has"
56,"Is gib wins, ksi fights him, fighters do it all the time, business is business"
57,"Bro gib is it winning this lol, give it up"
58,"Shut up, I wanna see some black on black action."
59,guys im goin to fight a pearson at school im gonna SHOCK THE WORLD
60,"It's not the winner of this fight, if gib wins mcbroom is not a great fight, but if mcbroom beats gib then jj can step in and fight him, same with gib v jake"
61,bro this mac Donald guy has soo much ego he thinks he’s equivalentto mike tyson type of shit what a dickhead
62,Gib is going to get humbled tyj
63,💀
64,💀💀💀
65,🤣🤣💀
66,[deleted]
67,Wait fr 😂
68,😂😂😂😂
69,Bro's doing what he can💀
70,I mean its the best way to get JJ's attention.
71,"You know in boxing friends always fight to improve each other. It’s not always about beef, basically it’s Goku and krillin"
72,"This. I don't honestly understand the childish mindset of this sub where every fight JJ takes has to be against someone he's got beef with. You're allowed to like and respect someone will still trying to best the shit out of them in the ring

I pretty regularly play football with my mates. Does them being my mates keep me from plowing through them to get the ball if they're coming at me in goal? Absolutely not"
73,The fight isnt gonna show anything special cuz they will holdback mate
74,"ive never interacted with this sub until recently and everytime i open a post its people talking as if they have insider knowledge, debating on leaving if people stop making opinions without knowing a thing"
75,"I really don't want him to win, the less money they give to him the better, the guy is a scumbag."
76,This Saturday
77,So?
78,I know dude same with this KSI fellow
79,why did bro get 60 downvotes 💀
80,🗿
81,Yes
82,Fam i cant💀💀💀💀😭
83,Imagine jj doing a reddit video and right before he sees this he ends the vid 💀💀💀
84,"Yeah, it’s called sparring"
85,Calling GIB krillin I see
86,Who’s is goku and who is krillin?
87,Comparing soccer to boxing is crazy 💀
88,"But boxing is different, you're actively trying to beat the shit out of your opponent  
In football/soccer, you're trying to win but you're not trying to hurt your opponents or anything"
89,"they wont hold back, you step into the ring and play the game, the problem with influencer boxing is people just jump on the bandwagon and think they know more than my pre breakfast shit, what a dumb assumption from you mr"
90,You clearly dont watch enough figths were friends were involved. Its a mutual agreement.
91,"it’s his promotion, but to be honest he probably won’t end up paying again anyways."
92,[deleted]
93,Thats his manager
94,"No I mean proper boxing matches, not everyone hates each other"
95,Aye krillin a good character never gives up but no not calling Gib krillin just an example
96,Imo if i fought a friend i aint gonna go too hard or try to have the “killer mindset”
97,Reddittors don’t like emojis for some reason
98,But that’s how JJ works. He has said it himself that he builds a hatred up towards the person he’s fighting no?
99,"Yeah, but in order to willingly go into a ring and wanting to beat the shit out of someone for months on end, you normally wouldn’t like them. I don’t think it’s smart for JJ to ruin a friendship over boxing"
100,It’s not gonna be a good fight mate.
