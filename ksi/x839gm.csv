0,"it's in a safety deposit box, he brings it out for special events like his Webley concert"
1,500K wasted. Never once seen him show it or wear it other than the video
2,"Would be badass if he played ""Beerus"" as his Entrace Theme while wearing this chain. Randolph deserves to rap for him too imo."
3,He should wear that to his next boxing fight ⬆️
4,Ain't that a Pokemon chain
5,It still looks sick I remember when he first showed the chain my jaw nearly dropped he should wear in for the entrance in his next fight maybe.
6,Saw him wear it at wembley the whole crowd was hyped
7,Ting is sick. Man’s not taking the pss.. Ting’s a madness. Musta cost several quid.
8,missanite > diamond just saying
9,he wore it at the Webley concert
10,Nah it's an investment. That'll shoot up in value in years to come. He has it locked up in a safe at a jewelers I think
11,I got that joke
12,bro what 💀
13,"Still, 500gs to wear it once or twice"
14,Why would you think that lol. Since when did custom diamond jewelry go up in value lol
15,"Maybe, if people actually care about DBZ by then."
16,He’s either not English and trying to talk our slang or he’s an AI learning more every day.
17,do you know how much the man is worth? even if he was worth 10mil thats 5% of his worth and 10mil is probably a huge underestimate
18,We all waste money
19,Maybe it will go up just because he owned it
20,i really fucking hope so lmao
21,He said in an interview a few years ago that he had 10 mil invested in property alone so his net worth is likely 50 mil and up
22,"Yeah and 5% of your net worth is alot. He’s not the richest man in the world, so this was a waste."
23,Not that much money oh lord
24,Custom things always lose value
25,"exactly, so thats then 1% of his worth like 500k is nothing to him lmao"
26,"yeah, and let's say he is worth 10 mil, which again is likely a big underestimate, if he spend 500k he still has 9million and 500k, that is still a lot of money"
27,You don’t have that much to spend. It won’t affect jj in the slightest
28,500k to Jj is likr 50 for us
29,I’m sure micheal jordan’s custom shoes have dropped in value
30,"It did at the time, maybe he’s rich enough to do that but even then if you ain’t gonna use it why buy it"
31,That’s an outlier. Jordan is the greatest basketball player ever
32,"It didn’t affect him when he bought it. Also, he bought it for special occasions"
33,Never once seen him wear it and he’s had many special occasions
34,Is it my problem you haven’t see it?
35,WHEN.
36,Idk if he’s ever worn it. I just know he said he bought it for special occasions
37,DID I ASK
38,No obviously not
39,So shush
40,You ate
41,U ate poo
42,I hope you get better
43,You mad bro
44,I saw your post history. I don’t value your opinion
