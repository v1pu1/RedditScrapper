0,"Many people sleep on the spider, when people say goat of mma they think of Jon Jones Anderson Silva Khabib Nurmagomedov, those 3 names i would say are the ones mentioned the most, people hear mma fighter and think he can't box, this is not the case with Anderson Silva, yes again his age, but silva has been boxing before, and i really think he could be a real challenge for Jake if not a problem."
