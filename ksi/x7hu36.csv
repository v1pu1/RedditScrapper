3,not at all related to this comment but i just want to know do you really like ksi?? as i read your other post and comments on this subreddit and most of them are of critisizing him ( this is not a hate comment or anything just want to know as most of the comments doesn't look they are his fans)
4,And you fell for KSI’s tactic and came to his Reddit

6,"i am a big ksi fan, but i hate people (12 yo's)  who dickride without using their brain. so Usually when i speak in the subreddit it's to defend the opposite opinion because everyone who does it gets downvoted.  
\-ksi is a very funny charismac person, i've been watching him since his beginning.  
some opinions that i have that upset the subreddit :   
\-i like ksi and i hate jake but for now jake is a better boxer and ksi's event was bit of an L  
\-alex isn't a pussy for not fighting since have a concussion increase the probability of second concussion in the months after.  
\- ksi kind of chickened for fighting woodly and gave bs excuse and now doesn't seem he'll fight jake next which for me is a pussy move.  


other than that i have the same opinion of the subrreddit."
