1,Nice how jj got so many followers in only 3 years. The guy is just build different
2,Got his start in 2019? Lol they are about 10 years off
3,"That post if it’s real is so bad, like good to be on the list yeah, but he didn’t start in 2019, isn’t a “YouTuber turned rapper and boxer” because he still is a YouTuber and probably won’t stop"
4,Here is the full [link](https://www.forbes.com/profile/olajide-olatunji/?sh=7483c63ce448) for JJ's profile
5,WHY IS JAKE ON 10 BRO
6,According to Forbes Jake Pule is the #10 top creator in the world LOL
7,10m? Have they not seen his crypto or
8,I've sent the corrections to forbes. Lets see
9,He's earning wayyyy more than $10m
10,This list is absolutely attrocious jake paul at 10 what the fuck he isnt even a youtuber anymore he fucked off with the money and now is a boxer
11,Lol what is this shitlist? He should be higher than #20 and Logan isn't even on here. Did they not hear that he just signed with WWE? Common Forbes L
12,Could have chosen a better picture
13,Kinda lame. #69 would've been more impressive
14,ahem... you mean WSI
15,Tf is that picture?
16,Cool. What am I supposed to do with this?
17,"I think its way more than 45 mil --- prime , xix , sides , yt , boxing , music , sidemen and much more"
18,JJ definately made more than 10 mill with his prime shit and stuff got to be.
19,I can name only 15 people on this list who are more famous than Deji
20,It's of 2021.......
21,"Side **MAN**, a **group**, grammar all over the place"
22,"impressive growth in such a short time, it truly is inspiring.  


I like how used to play fifa 13 in 2020 just to make us remember the good old times and made such good songs and skits and even managed to fight 5 times as well"
23,"This is a such a fumble Like how do they now about long KSI is in the game, there are not a lot of names bigger than him in the Yt game"
24,But not 19 years off but still a massive 10 years off
25,Forbes always does jj dirty
26,forbes is high man
27,Lol : “In relationship”
28,based on earnings
29,"even apart from crypto losses aside, he'd have a earned lot from his sidemen side of business, plus include Prime as well"
30,Have you seen his crypto?
31,great work king
32,yeah google shows 25+
33,[deleted]
34,The writer of this article was definitely high
35,"I think this is might be a troll or something,if you see xQc's it also has a meme picture simliar to JJ's and just outright wring information.

Now,I haven't looked at the whole list,so I might be wrong,but that's the only  2 creators I know with wrong information,so,this is my conclusion"
36,Nah I know I was meant to type in 10 but typed 19 by accident
37,">To build our first-ever Top Creators list, Forbesreporters—with help and insight from creator agency, Influential—judgedthousands of influencers (folks who launched their careers on socialmedia) on three critical metrics: earnings, ***clout*** and ***entrepreneurship***."
38,Didn’t prime start this year? Those are his 2021 earnings
39,"Much more accurate, given his business ventures and side hustles"
40,"That alone is not how it is ranked. It is ranked by earnings, clout and entrepreneurship"
41,Or just a bad writer.
42,"ah yes,  my bad"
