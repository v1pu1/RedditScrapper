6,Ayo 🤨📸
7,I still have yet to find any of the new flavor. Matter as fact I haven't seen any prime around for about half a year :(
8,Looks like you had the same problem as the blue is always sold out my local store usually has a great stock but never blue
9,lol
10,Canada got it before the Uk
11,There is no prime in quebec tho
12,Ay yoo bruh easy on the liquids ting🤣
13,That probably ain’t prime then lol
14,Phrasing
15,"LUCKY MF,i still cant find these anywhere bro"
16,Looool I found some at a convenient store as well for 7 dollars it’s called honey bee
17,i got them for 7 bucks in australia beat that
18,accomplishment
19,The KSI’s liquid thing is getting really fucking old
20,Grow up
21,I live in this small town and there’s a convenience store that got some so I bought out the whole stock lol
22,blue is ass
23,No we didn’t. I didn’t see it anywhere
24,Someone didn’t get any why the toxicity 🤣 sit down and think about your approach 😉
25,"corrr someone’s in a mood, just have a laugh mate lmao"
26,Nah bruh it’s weird.. got kids running around joking about drinking another man’s “liquids”? Like really lol tf is wrong with y’all
27,"LMAO you’re the one who’s made it weird ? i made no reference to human liquids, i found it funny because it’s just a weird way to say it. you’ve made it weird pal."
28,Made it weird? All I see on this Reddit is kids joking about “omg hahaha I’m drinking KSI liquids 🤪” … like it’s so weird yet y’all think it’s funny and normal. Maybe it’s a UK thing but never would that fly in the US
29,"no i think you saw one comment (mine) and instantly thought i meant something dirty, when i didnt, in the UK no one would say “Ksi liquids”. they would say “ksi’s drink” or “prime”. i meant nothing weird by it, but your mind instantly went towards the dirty thought."
30,Jj is the one that makes the joke. Maybe you should tell him that it would never fly in the us (as if thats even true lol)
31,Its a joke bro what’s with the fragility. Come out the closet you ain’t fooling anyone 😭
32,Bruh then you’re blind. I can go find 10 posts right now joking about the same shit. Again maybe it’s a UK thing but like hahaha so damn weird
33,Have you seen Logan doing that? Or literally anyone else? No? Just JJ huh? So yeah my point still stands lol that’s a UK thing and would not fly in the US
34,Y’all can keep your weird ass jokes over there then.. bc if we had minors talking about drinking a 30 year old influencers c*m it would blow up lmao but hey y’all do your weird pedo jokes have fun
35,"do it then, because i’ve seen no one talk about “ksis liquids” in a dirty sense"
36,Wow i don’t even know how to respond to such a genius response from you lmao
37,Who tf talking about cum dawg you weird as fuck
38,Go view my recent comment lol. There you go.
39,You have no argument lol bunch of weird ass people in the UK joking about drinking a grown man’s “liquids” lmao mad embarrassing
40,Are you dumb? You have kids laughing “Omg I’m drinking KSI’s liquid hahahaha” … or maybe the post that has 1k upvotes with a prime bottle labeled “KSI C*M” and has someone drinking it.. you can’t be this stupid
41,"okay fair enough but the bottle literally says “c*m” on it 💀 therefore it’s kinda down to the person who posted it, not the comments."
42,I don’t think you realize that you are actually the one without an argument. You are saying it’s a uk think but your only reason is that jj said it and Logan didn’t lmao. Also using person anecdotes is stupid as fuck
43,"1. KSI’s fanbase is primarily 16-22 (not kids)
2. You’re singling out the posts on a subreddit with millions of people on
3. You’re a neek get off this subreddit"
44,…. I apologize for being a douche you’ve actually been cool so my fault. Just get tired of those jokes tbh hahah just really weird to me that children are joking about drinking “KSI liquids”
45,Find a single American that has joked about that. We don’t say that shit over here lmao. Y’all are so weird bruh I swear
46,Go run along and joke about drinking another man’s liquids… so funny 🤪 bunch of freaks over there 😂😂
47,Singling out a post? That has generated over 1k people supporting said post? Not including all the comments on that post with minors joking about wanting to drink KSI’s c*m? For whatever reason y’all think that’s jokes and funny. It’s creepy af. They’re minors talking about drinking a 30 year olds c*m. I’m not gonna pretend that’s funny or okay lmao
48,"no problem man, don’t get me wrong i also find it weird, when i was their age we didn’t even know what c*m was lmao so yea it is weird how social media has ruined kids minds, sorry about the mix up"
49,Personal anecdotes are the best way to prove things right?
50,I didn’t delete my comment. I don’t see the comment you sent me either. It’s just Reddit being broken. It happens all the time
51,They aint minors though dawg they over 16
52,Nah brother you have nothing to apologize for. You’ve actually been really cool and I’ve been the toxic one so that’s my fault for judging you before speaking to you. But yeah man I can’t agree more.. you have literal children going on OnlyFans and all this.. it’s honestly sad to watch lol bc like you said when I was their age I was fascinated by rocks not a YouTubers “liquids”
53,….. damnit I feel bad for being a dick. I’m sorry. I’m just getting frustrated with these literal children running around saying stuff like that. It’s concerning.
54,Not tryna argue with you brother.. just think it’s a little off when children are joking about stuff like that.. when I was their age I barely knew what a vagina was lol I just feel like our youth is fucked
55,Not minors for y’all lol 18 is the legal consenting age here.
56,You’re weird. Have a good one
57,Thats exactly what youve been doing though. All youve done in this thread is argue
58,Well it aint there so keep your backwards ass in your shit country. Im going to sleep you’re boring me
59,… well I guess if you see no problems with children joking about drinking a grown man’s c*m then that’s that 😂😂 and I’m the weird one lmao
60,There’s a word for people like y’all.. funny thing is it’s a UK word.. nonce I think it’s called? Have a good one lol
61,Yeah bc honestly it’s alarming that few people see an issue with this. Imagine you have a child who is 15 or 16 talking about drinking another man’s cum who is in his 30’s. I highly doubt you’d just brush it off and say “oh it’s a joke” like nah it’s concerning
62,Can you drink my liquids?
63,"Yeah i get that but its not serious. If you’re as old as im guessing you are by your language, then you should know to take things on the internet with a pinch of salt. ESPECIALLY reddit"
64,I’m 27.. but seeing how our youth is growing up is terrifying af.. these kids nowadays are saying/doing thing I would have never even imagined doing/saying at their age. And I’m not just saying this instance.. like kids all around the world are just corrupt now
65,But I agree I shouldn’t be taking stuff on Reddit to this extent.. just difficult to watch tbh
66,Its the internet 🤷🏽‍♂️ kids are too easily influenced by it. Overexposure
67,100000% you’re right. And these kids are like the Guinea pigs trying it out… like if you think about it the generation coming up after us never experienced life without an iPhone or a computer.. we have no idea how these lil shits are gonna be in 10 years
