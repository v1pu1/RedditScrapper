0,bro who is that ?? 🤣🤣🤣
1,Bottom G at best bru💀
2,Isn't he 47-9
3,It’s crazy because ages ago anything about Andrew would have comments with people that said “actually some of the things he says makes sense” (which I’ll be completely honest I agree with certain very very specific things) but now everyone just despises him. And I have not been following this saga at all why did he actually get banned? Did he say something mad for one too many times or is it for something he said ages ago? Genuine question

19,"There was many accusations thrown, most if not all have been debunked.

20,Only people who admire him are Incels or Right Wing traditionalists

28,It says 2020
29,"Doesnt it say ""kb pro"""
30,"I thought so, people like Andrew Schulz and Bill Burr and even Dave Chapel say some things which are similar and we all nod they’re comedians. I’ve always felt like a lot of the hate he received was because he said his facts a bit aggressively and always acted like a know it all (because apparently if you say that 2+2=4 in a confident tone you get hate for it). Again I may not have seen some out of pocket things he said because I don’t follow him like that but most of the things he says just point towards the fact that society just sucks off women all the time (which is sadly true). I do remember a video where Ksi says that he agreed with some of his statements and another where Tate brothers showed respect towards KSI, how times have changed 😂. But yeah the fact that that women can just go on twitch and objectify themselves, make loads of money from it without getting banned, then complain about men who never catch on to the bullshit and continue to support them says everything."
31,Hmm I do agree with the incel bit(no idea about the other one tbh) I feel like a lot of the guys that follow him want to be like him not realising most of the girls he gets is because of his money or whatever. Like there needs to be a balance between simping for girls like most of the current society and just constantly shitting on them. But he is right about society being sexist towards men nowadays though I just think his way was a bit too aggressive/extremist.

33,"Left head, you mean hand. 😂"
34,"Im not a tate fan but why do people here consider speaking the truth regarding andrew, jake or whoever it is sucking them off?"
35,"He had 1 fight in 2020
His last fight before than was in 2014 
I meant to say"
36,"Oh yeah, then I think boxrec just didn't approve his other fights, like KSI’s recent fight"
37,"Yeah absolutely, society do treat men unfairly but he takes the idea too far"
38,Usual means used the most..
