0,I wouldn’t mind losing a fan if they’re that much of a degenerate
1,Ayo that top comment 😂
2,First comment is probably just the average one question go fan
3,“Watched growing up” said by a person who is definitely still in school.
4,KSI is a ni.....ce guy
5,Tate and his opinions only blew up recently right? So his comment would imply that after years of watching JJ it took a couple months for him to dick ride some other guy? Morale of the story: hoes ain't loyal
6,Tapin Sapien talking like he not 7 years old like if he dont shut his dumbass up
7,"listen man idc who hates who, I just wanna see both of them fight tbh"
8,"Andrew Tate fans/followers are literally all just impressionable people who don't have any guidance in life. I don't know why people keep on talking about this insecure, piss poor excuse of a man."
9,This complain about “bots” is pretty ironic now considering how many of these fucking children just constantly regurgitate what they hear from these red pilled YouTubers
10,Woah
11,man decided to follow some dude who just popped up whos just any random shit to get the crowd going over someone he says hes been watching for years. The only reason tate is even popular is because he pushes the right buttons and gets enough people made that people think maybe he has a point. KSI has been entertaining us for years and we have seen this man grow into a better person one who can live in this society with his own beliefs. Ones that dont offend half the fuckin planet and mind fuck the other half
12,"For guys who want a girlfriend, they ride that Tate dick pretty hard lol"
13,"what are they gonna do, dislike the video? lmaoooo"
14,Guaranteed they’re all under 18
15,These ksi fans have been abducted by some new mf named tandrew aate
16,I love how all tate fan boys comment as if what they have to say is important and people are listening
17,"He is just cleaning the toxic 12 yr olds out of his community

Imma sit and enjoy that"
18,"We need just to ignore them. More attention we give them, they will feel like they have more power"
19,He’s a slave to the matrix 🤓
20,"They always dick ride him I wonder how much longer till he is irrelevant in every way



If you're a Tate fan go suck your dad"
21,Just love out of all the clips in the video he picks the one where JJ is about to give simon a bj😂
22,"Woah, KSI is black? Never knew!"
23,Anyone else remember that one olddd Q&A where there was just like 10 tweets calling him the n word? I think that shit desensitized me to it honestly
24,"Nah mate, JJs comment have been like that for years."
25,Yo tobi is pregnant ;⁠)
26,That guy is funny if he thinks he was ever a KSI fan
27, The comment section on that vid is now infested with Tate fans
28,Tate fans are all braindead and mindwashed💀
29,Toddler Taters
30,Why are we pretending this isn’t the average ksi fan? You guys tormented black people in school days 😭💀 your literally no better
31,"If a dude has an American Psycho profile pic, you already know he doesn’t get enough love and attention at home lmao

33,Good riddance lol
34,The riding is crazy
35,There are 2 types of Lamedrew fans
36,Bro outta pocket 💀💀
37,"Ye well we don't care, JJ is a realist in the modern world but what tate is still living in the past not being hateful or anything but being a fan of both of them, tate needs to adapt in the real world... But the fact is that tate is not being serious all the time about what he says about women, that's what JJ doesn't know cuz he saw the things about tate on tiktok in other words ""EDITED""... What I'm trying to say is that tate is a good guy it's just social media that makes him seem so mean. But I support both sides... Cuz tate doesn't understands JJ and neither JJ understands tate. That's what I'm willing to make them both understand. HOPE THEY BOTH READ THAT 🙂👍"
38,I mean Andrew tate should know we dont take shit bout our fitneek by anyone else..
39,KSI is a W but Daz is an L
40,How is someone calling Ksi a sell out at all related to him being an Andrew Tate supporter. Stop reaching
41,With the hard R haaahahaha
42,"These people are npc L ksi W tate common L Common W, they are the same person"
43,Perfectly paused
44,The “fans” KSI should just filter out would make comments Section a better place
45,Wait till they find out that tate is black
46,"Andrew Tate fans are just 13 year old keyboard warriors. Doesn’t phase JJ at all, just funny reading these comments. Mindless Tate D riders"
47,Flashbacks from that mean tweets video lol

53,Fucking Dick Riders
54,Bunch of tates bald head suckers
55,That top comment is normal
56,"This is honestly sad. I feel bad for them (them before Tate) you may believe in some of the stuff he says, but any good he says means nothing due to his past in abuse."
57,Straight to the point lmao
58,"Slowly but surely, JJ is weeding out the shit followers."
59,*sorts by controversial*
60,"If there just going to leave all the sudden like that and change up they where never a fan

94,I'm 💀💀💀💀💀💀 with that top comment
95,Tbh some of them could just generally be hate comments I’m sure he gets a load of them but I’m not standing by the message these comments are saying
96,"This is the same as what speed fans did to Jake Lucky on twitter after he tweeted about speed using that minecraft mod, I wouldn't mind losing fans if they're that mindless and can't make up their own opinion"
