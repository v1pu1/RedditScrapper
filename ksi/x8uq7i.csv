1,Jake always has to have an advantage to take a fight
2,So we gonna act like Anderson isn’t 50 years old and retired? Regardless of what he’s done in the past
3,He thought he did some💀
4,My man showed everyone that he downvoted!
5,Almost every single comment on this post so far has been made by a stupid KSI blind follower who can't think for themselves and just trash Jake because JJ does. They can find any excuse.
6,"My mans get out of this Reddit, and back to America with ur child marketer"
7,bro he sleeps everyone who is in yt boxing and he will make jake go night night
8,JJ just fought a rapper with no boxing experience and a walmart employee. Yall are fucking delusional nuthuggers lmao
9,"Not only is he arguably the greatest MMA striker ever, but he also beat a boxing champion last year. He’s by far the toughest opponent in any YouTube boxing fight bar Floyd Mayweather."
10,and what are jake dick riders doing in this sub 🤣
11,"I despise Jake Paul as a YouTuber. I’ve been watching KSI and Deji since 2012. I’m just honest about Jake’s achievements in boxing, and how his record is much more impressive than JJ’s."
12,Loooooooooool based on what
13,"Lol you’re getting downvoted, but KSI has beat a rapper he collabed with, two YouTubers and a “pro boxer” who was the worst fighter of the night. Even if you ignore Woodley, at least when Jake wanted to fight a pro boxer, it was Fury and Rahman Jr who both have good records and can actually fight."
14,How old was that boxing champ? Also retired?
15,jake didn't cared to save a event jj didn't do it on purpose he himself was disappointed by the pro fighter and shut up cry baby
16,"Firstly, just because we disagree doesn’t mean we have to downvote each other. That’s not what the button is for.

Secondly, the boxing champion Ortiz that Silva beat, was the same age as him. Silva easily beats all of JJ and Jake’s opponents."
17,"Yeah he was the same age meaning he is also 50 so don’t act like he’s in world champ shape anymore, also I didn’t downvote it was some one else"
18,Just because they’re nearly 50 doesn’t mean they’re easy fights. Floyd Mayweather was old and still breezed past McGregor. The fact that Silva beat Ortiz is impressive and I really wouldn’t be surprised if he beat Jake. It really isn’t an easy fight at all.
19,"Yeah I don’t think it will be super easy but the thing people make fun of Jake for still stands, especially when he was going to fight two real boxers who are young but cancelled both"
