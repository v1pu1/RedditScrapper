1,that bitch is one of the cringest mfs on twitterü§£ü§£
2,Silly bitch
3,"JJ does look pretty dumb, in what way has Jake tried to sabotage his event? Alex getting a concussion has nothing to do with Jake (Jake being involved is a theory with no solid evidence). 

Like sometimes JJ need to read his tweets before he posts. It doesn't mater because there are  people that will ride him even if he's wrong. It is what it is."
4,Jakes been real quiet since this
5,**Watch out he is gon block you ü§£ü§£**
6,complicated way of saying 'no one asked'

12,Goddamn.
13,"Alex signed under jakes promotion.
So maybe jake paid a bag to alex so he will fake a concussion, or alex just smashed his head against the wall after the face to face.
Either way there are planty of evidance showing alex is fine and he just wanted to ditch the fight last second so jj's event will be ruined."
14,glad ur sensible enough. jj's just making this assumption because alex wassabi has jake paul's boxing team advising him on his journey lol. wade plem legit confirmed to us that he knows that alex is injured. this reddit is filled with ksi stans who ride him to death.
15,If JJ agreed to fight Jake on august 27th Jake would have pulled out in the last second to cancel the event.
16,The amount of cringe fanboys generates iss ridiculous
17,"jjust factually incorrect. wade plem literally confirmed for us in the gib interview that he knows for a fact that alex is injured. alex decided to not waste his time and energy in a response showing medical records, private information cuz jj and his stans would keep pushing the false info that he got bribed or faked the injury cuz it prolly wont reach as much people who believe alex got bribed or faked it according to jj and keem."
18,"Bitch please, alex had no buisness stepping in the ring, he didnt promote the fight, he was scared shitless and didnt want to be there. And of course he is injured, he used all his training for the fight to smash himself in the head as hard as he could."
19,he did promote the fight but whatever... its clear you're a diehard alex wassabi hater. its impossible to convince the likes of you to stop the hate from clouding the reality.
