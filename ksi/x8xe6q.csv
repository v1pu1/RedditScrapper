0,Mad to think at that time Anderson didnâ€™t know his biggest pay day will be from that little rat on his right
1,why does jake look like the pokÃ©mon go kid
2,"Did you know, Anderson had his first pro boxing match when Jake was a year old."
3,How do people find stuff from years ago just casually? Nowadays I'm beginning to even worry that somebody is archiving stuff I do or say on the internet just to post it like 10yrs later
4,Jake always seemed to be on the spectrum
5,Why does Jake look like that special kid in the class.
6,That poor sweet kid. He doesn't realize he's going to grow up as a douche :(
7,"Damn, it's a small world."
8,More history than Swarmz and JJ
9,Thatâ€™s actually surreal
10,A
11,I might get downvoted to oblivion but how does this relate to ksi
12,Anderson was probably 37 when this was taken
13,"Wow, I remember his vine videos, they were okay but now he's far worse than he was then"
14,Silva never knew what was coming lmao
15,TfðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
16,Hm
17,Fuck Jake Paul
18,yeah he was their favorite fighter growing up
19,"Everyone by november
"" see That little boy on the left? 
  He knocked out that guy on the right"""
20,Who took the picture bro
21,Bro ðŸ˜‚
22,who is that PokÃ©mon??
23,Jake a dickhead for this fam. Silva really out here doing them a solid. Years later Jake Finna put him in a coma bro.
24,"I remember when this was r/ksi and not r/paulbros, r/andrewtate, ect."
25,Oh wow lmao
26,Hate to be the one but that grammar....
27,Wow bro that declaration of half you shits a but harsh bro...fuck I wanted him to win now I'm not so sure on that
28,Another fun day and the jake Paul sub Reddit here
29,Can't believe some people started tolerating these guys ðŸ¤®
30,this age wekk
31,That little weAAAZAAL
32,Thatâ€™s acc crazy when u put it like that
33,Bro thinks one of the best mma fighter ever is gonna get his biggest payday from jake paul lmao
34,I doubt this will be his biggest pay day .. dude was collecting millions from headlining ppvs and collecting ppv money and he was sponsored by Nike
35,"Speaking of that kid he still makes music. It's genuinely very decent. His name is Misha, go check him out"
36,As someone on the spectrum I approve this
37,because he is that special kid
38,Jake Paul always had a douche he look in his face even as a kid
39,I honestly donâ€™t care about no storyline there I just loved Swarmzâ€™s show
40,"35, the pic is 12 years old"
41,"what? Its just a fight bro, relax. People fight their idols all the time its a form of respect. You acting like Silva was held at gunpoint to accept this, he will be paid well. I donâ€™t get why this sub is disrespecting Silva, he is a MMA legend and he has great boxing skills, this isnâ€™t an easy fight for Jake. In fact, Jake is the underdog here some would say."
42,How's Jake a dickhead for giving him the biggest paycheck of his career
43,"""Your BROTHER'S IN MY DMS"""
44,MMA fighters dont do any money compared to boxers. This will be his biggest payday or atleast very close to it
45,I think he meant from a fight it might be his biggest check..although knowing his stature i am still skeptical
46,How much did he pay you?
47,No thank you
48,The irony is he was the bully
49,Well Disney kids usually do
50,But Silva 47 years old though
51, he earned a lot in ufc pre reebok deal from sponsorships
52,Nothing. I just find his story extremely interesting
53,"Heâ€™s also 

A. A pro boxer, and he ainâ€™t Pineda thatâ€™s for sure

B. Anderson fucking silva"
54,Nah still peanuts
