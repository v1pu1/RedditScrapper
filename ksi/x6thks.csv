14,The Kangaroo would win 😮‍💨.
15,That's a Vio 😂🤣
16,He’s fucking gigantic for his height holy shit won’t his cardio be negatively affected by the muscle mass etc
17,Now that’s funny
18,his ribs i guess
19,Gib proven to be good in the ring so he isn’t like fousey in that respect
20,Aint it a compliment tho
21,"No, he’s not much bigger than he was before, just really lean so he appears larger"
22,I saw online it said he was 194 so I just be mistaken if that is 194 plus at 5 7 or 5 8 which is apparently his height then he’s a beast
23,"He's nowhere near 194, he would be chunky the he's 5""8"" and most likely around 180-183 lbs"
24,My bad I looked it up he’s only 85kg and holder fight he was only 170 something
