0,"People seriously think silva was just some old random mma fighter. Silva is arguably one the greatest mma fighters ever.

Insane striker and has boxed professionally as well already plus he beat julio chavez jr in a boxing match few months ago, that too convincingly."
1,Who said Silva is losing this?
2,The OP of this is literally brain dead
3,"People make a good point and a contructive comment.

&nbsp;

OP: Silva boxing skills are shit"
4,“With kids” literally most elite fighters have kids
5,I bet Silva will still look better than both opponents KSI fought lmao
6,Tbf tho if anyone was running it was tommy.
7,The disrespect people give Silva is kinda sad. I mean you probably never watched him in the ufc nor any of his boxing fights. He is way better than anyone jake has ever fought
8,"I know Jake Paul is an extremely hateable guy , but you guys need to put some respect on Silva's name , man is 47 but wil still probably beat both Jake and KSI"
9,i fucking hate this subreddit sometimes
10,Lmao yall already making excuses for him if he wins
11,Anderson silva can take both Swarmz and Pineda at the same time blindfolded. This is better than both of KSI’s recent fight.
12,"I think that these are kids making these posts. And know nothing about Silva and have never heard of him before and now hear about him for the first time when Jake is fighting him. As hard as it is to admit it, but this is a W in Jake’s books. Doesnt matter the age of Silva, he definitely still has the fight in him, and he is still LEGENDARY in the fighting scene. 

Same could be applied if Jake fought Tyson, would it still be an L? Just cause Tyson is 56 years old? (And no, im not saying Silva is same level as Tyson, especially in Boxing alone) but yall get what i mean."
13,Your guys boxing knowledge sometimes shows lmao. Anderson silva is the toughest opponent jake has faced. hes not only the greatest mma fighter and striker but he also has a boxing record of 3-1. peoples argument will be well hes 47. yes while that is true he still beat a boxer who was WBC middleweight champion with a record 53-6 just last year. Any unbiased person will say this is a good fight for jake. he will gain a lot of experience. I don't really understand this whole fight a pro boxer thing anyway. He could fight a nobody like pineda but nobody would care about that. all the known boxers who would bring big numbers are most likely too good for jake.
14,"Rahman just didn't make weight. Jake never ran, rahman signed an Agreement to fight at a weight and failed to make it there."
15,"I’d take jake fighting a 47 year old that can actually box over a 25 year old who’s never boxed and given just two weeks to prepare against jj

U can’t rlly talk shit about Jakes opponents after seeing jj’s opponents"
16,"You Have to be braindead to shit on Jake fighting Anderson Silva ,after the 2 joke fights JJ had.
Braindead or under the age of 15."
17,"I dislike Jake, but saying he ran away from Tommy or Rahman is a bad take. 

Rahman was the one that shot the fight, he said he could make weight but he didn’t. 

Tommy had visa problems and the Furies were all over the place with their information, one person says this, another says that. 

Yes he could’ve fought Rahman at a higher weight, yes he could’ve moved the fight to another country. But saying he ran from both, especially Rahman is a bad take"
18,If ksi was doing what jake was yall would hype him up
19,"Jake cried here bc he was fighting for his security guy who died right before the Ben Askren fight, this is in poor taste OP"
20,"Lol people here are delusional Hassim knew what he had to do, he signed the contract and didn’t plan to honour it. Tommy’s team could not make it in the US the 2nd time and the 1st one he was injured I believe. Jake Paul as much as I dislike the guy isn’t the reason why it didn’t happen. Now he is fighting Silva who was winning fight as recently as last year and I heard they were big fight so I feel like people here are just 12yo kids who like everything to fit their narrative, no wonder why that bald misogynistic chicken legged douche bag was so popular here.

Legit Jake didn’t fight and yet he still upgraded opponent compare to the 2 previous guy he was going to fight.

Like him or not, Silva would knock anyone in the YT boxing scene in his current state."
21,"Whoever made this is an absolute idiot and knows nothing about the sport of boxing at all.

You delusional KSI fanboys keep on spamming that he's 47 years old and ""he's not a real boxer"". That's all a bunch of BS!

Silva is arguably the greatest MMA fighter of all time and the greatest striker. Regarding your ""He's not a real boxer"" BS, he beat a 35 year old Former World champion boxer with 61 fights to his name last year. But you JJ D - Riders will still make up that excuse. Silva is a bigger Challenge than Fury and is better than most of the pro boxers our there. 

I honestly don't know why Jake is taking this fight. It's a lose lose situation for him. If he wins all of you will make those excuses and say Silva is shit. And if he loses you will mock him and say he lost to a grandpa and all that shit.

You're acting as if the guy is 60 ffs. Foreman was world champion until he was 48 and went 12 rounds with a prime Shannon Briggs. You don't suddenly become useless. And Silva proved that by beating that Julio Cezar Chaves jr last year. Oh and by the way, Chavez went 12 rounds with Canelo. 

Dana White himself recently said Silva is the GOAT and a very good boxer. He said Jake Paul would never call Silva out because he's too good.

I swear you pathetic little dick - riding kids wouldn't be happy even if Jake Paul beat Canelo. You'd make up some other excuse and say he should fight Tyson Fury. Realize that JJ isn't in the same realm of skill as Jake. They're uncomparable. Jake is an Average BOXER at this moment - the words of Eddie Hearn, promoter of AJ and Canelo. JJ is a good YOUTUBE BOXER. He's not nearly as good as Jake. Jake could easily just fight YouTubers but he's actually fighting real fighters, not some rapper with 2 rounds training and no experience or a 2 - 5 ""pro"" boxer who's only wins were over an 0 - 5 fighter and a debutant. And stop with the whole ""It's a warm up fight"" BS. I can assure you JJ's sparring partners were way better. He could've fought a much better opponent. Even Tyron Woodley offered to fight him.

It's as if you are stuck in some sort of cult and JJ is your god. It's really as if you're worshipping him or something. 

I've always liked JJ and never liked Jake, but these toxic fanboys and JJ's humongous ego are making me like Jake more and more. I truly believe JJ needs to get knocked tf out to bring him back down to earth. He really thinks he's some type of god. And looking at the comments on all his posts, I understand why. You really see him as your lord and saviour KSI."
22,"OP and all the upvoters casually ignoring the fact that this 47 year old would ASSASSINATE the two guys JJ fought


Quit making fucking excuses 🤦"
23,"You can't judge Anderson Silva by age. The Guy beat a Former ""Boxing"" Champion in his last fight. Jake is definitely the Underdog. Give credit were it is due."
24,KSI fans are legit delusional. They are trolling Jake Paul who is literally fighting arguably the best MMA fighter and who has beaten a 35 year old dude who has 53 wins and 32 KOs in boxing. Where as Ksi is fighting a rapper who was never even fought anyone and a kid who he randomly picked up who is apparently a Professional boxer. Stfu for fuck's sake.
25,Keep that same energy when JJ fights rappers and lanky kids
26,"You idiots can't get credit this time. Silva is way better than any opponent Jake has EVER fought, even right now. Yet if Jake wins, although that'd be an amazing feat and prove that he's one to be reckoned within the Youtube Boxing space, you dumbasses will still find excuses.

The fact that this has this many upvotes proves how many of you are blind JJ followers who can't think for themselves."
27,I don't like Jake as a person but put some respect on him. Woodley and Silva are far better contenders than anyone KSI or anyone in the influencer scene has fought so far. Yeah he's being a little bitch by dodging prime fighters but to say Woodley and Silva are nobodies is wack.
28,"Istg, i love jj, but y'all are major dick riders. Except the 2 logan paul fights, all his fights were shit, the opponents were shit, Jake has fought tougher opponents, woodley being one of them who he knocked. And istg if i see anyone calling anderson silva weak, or an easy fight because he's 47, I'll personally buy you a new brain because it seems the older idiot brain of yours got fucked by stupid."
29,Bro everyone talks about how jake paul fans are disrespecting anderson. Nah bro its KSI fans. Anderson would destroy ksi. Its insane that people think Jake will win let alone do it easily.
30,Ain’t Anderson the same man that beat Chavez last year or sum
31,"The disrespect of silva is crazy I get it you don’t like Jake Paul but putting down his every achievement ain’t it,"
32,"Does anyone here actually know anything about combat sports? Anderson Silva is in the MMA goat discussion. Yes he’s over the hill age wise, but he’s one dangerous motherfucker. He beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by decision in his home town of Mexico about a year ago. 

Basically - there’s a good chance Jake gets knocked the fuck out."
33,Jake didn’t run from either of them…
34,jj after he couldn't even manage to sleep a fat deliveroo driver and a starving Mexican child....
35,"The amount of disrespect ksi fanbase is showing to Silva man ,c'mon man just watch this video(https://youtu.be/BLzMPtFRxrs)  of Silva and then atleast think about what you're saying ,you have no clue who he is if you think Silva is an easy fight."
36,genuinely not sure who will win tho
37,No matter how tough of an opponent jake fights everyone’s gonna still find a way to bully him lol😂
38,"Silva would send ksi to a hospital 

Ksi can’t even knock out 2 bums

Tkos aren’t real ko’s"
39,U do know that Anderson Silva smokes Tommy fury and beats Hasim handily right
40,"So many people prove how little they know in this space in here. I don’t like Jake, and yes Silva is old and not what he used to be, bit he’s still very good. He just beat a 35 year old Chavez Jr who is 53-6, was a 46-0 with multiple defences champion, albeit back in 2012, and only a few years ago was fighting Canelo and Jacobs. 

Jacobs for all of the people who don’t follow boxing, was middleweight champ a few years ago and had only lost to Canelo and GGG in the last decade or so. 

Jake may be a twat, but he’s some YouTube/Vine/Disney kid who has just flatlined a former Welterweight champ known for his KO power, albeit in MMA, and is about to fight one of the greatest kickboxing heavy MMA fighters ever, who just beat a very high level boxer in a boxing match. You’ve gotta give him his due, I just hope Silva sparks him."
41,The disrespect to Silva just shows how little y’all know about combat sports lmao. I don’t like Jake at all but I give props when they are due. And this fight is something to not scoff at. Silva is a force to be reckoned with
42,You lot are disrespecting Silva
43,has jake really been running from tommy?
44,"Jake fighting one of the best MMA fighters out there…LSI fighting swarmz and Pineda, the guy who didn’t know how to box 💀"
45,"Silva beat a 53-6 boxer last year, he's not an easy fight even at his age."
46,I get the Jake Paul hate but dont disrespect Anderson Silva.
47,"Anderson Silva is a fucking beast and anyone who disagrees knows nothing about the dude or his background in combat sports. At one point he was legitimately the most dangerous man alive at his weight class, I’m talking about best in the fucking solar system. STFU about him being old and shit now, he’s still a highly skilled and trained KILLER. Yes Silva is going to be boxing for this fight instead of MMA but that don’t mean shit. If you try to say “Oh well Askren is an MMA fighter and he got knocked out so it’ll be the same thing” well I got news for you. Askren is a chump compared to Silva on the MMA scene, in fact Askren has never been a great all-round MMA fighter, he just knew how to use wrestling to his advantage against opponents who couldn’t wrestle for shit. Goddamn man idk how Silva is getting talked down on in the comments, he deserves way more respect and people should respect Jake for fighting him regardless if you think Jake is a moron or not (he is btw). Give credit where credits due guys c’mon"
48,Bro tommy pull out the fight 🗿
49,Silva would dick down ksi
50,Yeah instead he should be fighting against malnourished Mexican and a dude who's been boxing for 2 weeks
51,"OP has no idea who Anderson Silva is. The spider, the goat. Boxing record speaks for itself, and is very impressive given his age and what his body has been through. 

OP = 🤡"
52,Silva>>KSI’s Two Opponent and that’s a fact
53,Yet ksi couldn't knock out a twig and a ballerina dancer.
54,He looking like he’s taking the biggest shit ever
55,"Some of y’all really don’t know who The Spider is, huh?"
56,Silva is gonna beat the shit out of him
57,"Lads, this isn't some random 47 year old fighter. This is Anderson Silva one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time. Now I hate Jake Paul A LOT, but fair play to him for picking the toughest opponent yet. I could see Silva winning this fight, UNLESS there's something hiding in the contract that we don't know about."
58,Silva vs Izzy you should see that silva is massively valid still
59,Silva runs through ksi lol
60,"Crazy how many people know nothing about the fighting scene. It’s fine for people to start following UFC and Boxing because of influencers now but for them to make posts acting like they know anything about someone like Silva is laughable. I’m obviously a KSI fan, and will route for him in his fight will Jake, but respect what Paul has done for the sport and try to remain impartial. People make excuses for KSI constantly when he picks pathetic unknown opponents but when jake picks one of the most ruthless mma fighters of all time people say he’s scared. Its ridiculous to insinuate that this fight isn’t gonna be tough for Jake, Silva is an animal and has been training boxing for years now. Many of the greats carry on training and excelling in sports into their 40s and even early 50s.. Tom Brady is 45, Mike Tyson is 56, Tom Cruise is 60 (not a sports athlete but still a good example of how people are constantly redefining what it means to be young and fit). Don’t sleep on Silva, he could easily win this."
61,jj is gonna slap him up
62,Op is biggest dick rider
63,"There is a lot of people defending Anderson Silva here. But, the thing is that Jake is actually a very good boxer. Not a world champion as he would like others to believe, but quite possibly more skilled than spider Silva."
64,Tommy is ass jake would’ve knocked him out inside 3 rounds and hasim well idk bout him
65,Thus subreddit is delusional 😂. Pumping up JJ after he fights two of the shittiest opponents ever in YouTube boxing while shitting on Jake Paul after fighting two former UFC champions KOing one.
66,"Ya really going to talk about Anderson fuking Silva like he ain’t shit and the add on “with kids”  it just trying to hard 
Ya remember JJ fought swarmz and Luis both the given 2 weeks to train , try to hype them up as a tough and pro boxer and both gave the worst Performance ever lmao"
67,Silva beats Fury
68,The worst part is that he thinks he had done something 💀💀💀
69,Some of you need knowledge about boxing. You calling Silva some old man
70,This meme was posted on Twitter lol and silva is a good fighter. the disrespect is real ong
71,selling custom feet pics for 50% off dm me rn !
72,Silva beat a prospective Julio Ceasar Chavez who was rumoured to be fighting Jake. This believe it or not is not an easy fight.
73,Not JJ’s childarmy discrediting Jakes opponent like their hero didn’t just bully a chopstick of a fucking kid in the ring. Silva is an insane fight for someone this early in their career and there isn’t a clear winner at least - making it an actual fight instead of someone agreeing to be a punching bag for money
74,nah man ... i respect him if he doesn't cancel tho! lmao
75,"Silva isn’t losing this, Silva may be old but he’s the real deal."
76,Plz Silva beat him
77,idk why but when I read the title I thought that jake was running from TommyInnit and that made it even funnier that he's scared of an 18 y/o minecraft youtuber
78,Bro jake is loosing to silvia
79,Guys guyss jokes aside Silva is very credible and if jake manages to match him or even look good and land few clean shots.. I would actually be surprised 'coz Silva got that craZYyyy head movement.
80,Happy cake day
81,these dudes are genuinely just getting paid for a good nights sleep at this point
82,"I know we dislike jake Paul but this is actually a good fight. Besides his age, Silva is in good form plus his combat IQ is unmatched. Bro is in the GOAT conversation for UFC. I don’t think Jake wins this easily or even wins at all"
83,He didn’t run from either of them let’s stop the cap
84,"Silva is much more dangerous the fury in my opinion I havent seen much from rahman but Silva is a top tier striker, he has my respect for the other fights but this is his first real challenge against someone who’s hungry"
85,9 year old Me crying coz my mom didn't buy me the limited edition Spiderman underwear
86,I think we shouldn't really be talking when jj fought Pineda and swarmz 💀
87,OP = ksi meat rider
88,Andersons son is older than Jake
89,"Bro the disrespect is crazy. I don’t like Jake but I gotta respect him taking Silva, he got hands (watch his last fight). Just cuz you hate Jake don’t mean you have to discredit his opponents."
90,"Put some fucking respect on Anderson silva he is a million times better then any one ksi has fought, Anderson silva is a amazing boxer who has beaten a former world champion very convincingly"
91,"I’m a KSI fan but…..”

You’re not"
92,"If silver fights hard and shows good technique and jake wins
Kudos to jake
If silver fights Like an old man and gets slept immediately
No credit given
Its not always about track record. It depends if the fighter actully shows up"
93,He looks like he's taking a shit...lol
94,3-0 (1 KO) in boxing since he retired from MMA. This will be a good fight
95,"Was arguably one of the greatest, but everyone ages, even though he had a good boxing record after retiring from mma, still a 47 yo won’t be able to take punches, not saying he’s gonna lose, but you definitely cant be sure that he’s gonna win"
96,"It don’t matter bro, Messi and Ronaldo are the best football players of all time let them back into the competition 10-20 years later they will be lucky if they even touch the ball"
97,Silva is easily better then tommy fury
98,How do people say he is one of the greatest mma fighters ever? I'm genuinely curious. His record is 34-11. A lot of people have a better record than that.
99,Silva boxing skills are shit
100,"If you look into Chavez he has being doing terribly, silva beating him was definitely on the cards considering Chavez’ recent drug issues and failure to meet goals.

Yes, Chavez *was* great, he went 50 wins with minor losses, but don’t forget, he had a HUGE fall from grace. He’s lost 4/6 of his last fights"
