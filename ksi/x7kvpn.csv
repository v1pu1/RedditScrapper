0,Isn't It the water weight they lose that make the skin thinner thus making the muscle seem more prominent? I thought I read something along those lines.
1,"Suddenly everyone is an expert about steroids even though they don't know one person that takes em and are just going off what is trendy rn. If you have to have surgery and are in and out of the hospital with the doctors telling you no stressful activity you lose your muscle definition, plus water weight added back on. Small chance it's steroids, look at Joe Weller. That's steroids."
2,"While the joke is funny, this is not uncommon for pro fighters. Just look at Paddy Pimblett, he goes from ripped to dad bod within days. Itâ€™s very easy to regain weight after a fight, for a variety of reasons."
3,Man looks like a deflated balloon
4,Bro turned him from the wolf to the cat
5,"He is still physically very lean at like 15-10% bodyfat.
If he didnt just eat a meal, was under better lighting, wasnt drinking as much water.
He would probably still have rock solid abs maybe not as clear as before tho.
Having no abs doesnt mean your fat kids."
6,Ayooo!! The olatunji's really do hit hardd...
7,HOLY SHIT ðŸ¤£
8,Ayoooo
9,Deji did a number on his nose though
10,The Tank blew up the Wolf
11,"Forget the roids, deji knocked this mans jaw so hard that his beard fell offðŸ¥¶"
12,Itâ€™s probably bc fousey canâ€™t train or workout when heâ€™s injured probably advised to eat more etc not to mention all the pics he takes have social media illusions like a pump most people the same when Iâ€™m on a deload for example no working out etc I wonâ€™t be as pumped up etc and will look a little out of shape in comparison to before hand
13,"Yeah theyâ€™re quite dehydrated making weight for the fight. 

Once the weigh in is done, they hydrate and put on most of the lost weight. Then after the fight, they eat a lot"
14,Years of yinkaâ€™s beating i guess
15,na even joe weller is a bit of stretch he's on roids cuz he just seem pissed that jj was trying cause a ruckus when he was hired to be there part of the broadcasting team.
16,Joe constantly displaying roid rage symptoms is what makes me believe you
17,true. just look at deji after the jake paul fight lol.
18,"Paddy willingly overeats. Heâ€™s free to do what he wants but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s healthy for your body to constantly shift weight in such short time. Most fighter will gain like 20 pounds after a fight, paddy literally becomes a heavyweight fighter"
19,No. This is not real. I cant believe you people believe this. Since when??
20,use punctuation
21,"I 100% agree with you, not a fan of what Paddyâ€™s doing. Itâ€™s probably fine while heâ€™s young, but itâ€™s gonna  cause problems later in his career."
22,"Angles pump lighting is what most fitness models use to looks as good as they do if you try it yourself you will look a whole lot better fousey canâ€™t workout us heâ€™s injured and likely is eating more during recovery from
All the injuries on top of that heâ€™s not pumped up or working out just letting you know"
23,How is it possible to gain weight so fast and lose muscle?
24,"He didnâ€™t lose muscle, not a single pounds blood is just not flowing through them and heâ€™s eating more so water weight, etc gives the illusion he lost a lot of muscle. 

Go looks something up about social media illusions or better look up a fitness model or athlete whent ehya re taking a break bc of injury and see how they look considerably worse even if itâ€™s 2 weeks.
Fousey still weighs 175 still has a load of muscle but he is not training etc so he has more water etc and is likely in a calorie surplus for recovery combine that with bed rest ofc he isnâ€™t gonna look like a shredded fitness model. 
Do you workout if youâ€™ve worked out done resistance training and took a break you would notice bro."
