0,"Just really needs to let Tate go. He’s already been deplatformed. He’s been handled.

Letting Tate into the ring legitimizes any views he has. If you let Tate into the ring, people will go and see who this guy is and they will find more than just his Romanian Sex trafficking stuff. They will find the the dehumanizing woman hating incel talking points, adopt them and start preaching that stuff again growing that ideology more. That ideology did not start with Tate and it did not end with Tate, but it will grow more prominence if you give it a platform."
