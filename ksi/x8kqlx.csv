0,It's almost the end of 2022 and this is based off of 2021 >\_>
1,Bro you do realise this all estimated. No one knows for sure how much they earned lol.
2,How many monthly listeners on Spotify?
3,Reddit mfks deciding who earned more money 💀
4,"Biggest cap lmao, Mf had so many deals this year including Adidas"
5,This was probably before Prime started. Prime most likely skyrocketed both Logan’s and JJ’s net worth
6,Can someone explain to me why JP has 57.3M followers? I can't even watch his videos for more than 10s
7,"Forbes are wrong af and it showed quite easily with their “ksi got his start in 2019”

JJ 100% made more than 10mil. He has so many side businesses than just YouTube and my bet is that’s where they’ve calculated his money from just his YouTube earnings. They’ve taken Jakes boxing earnings but ignored everything KSI has done from sidemen products to his own sponsorships and deals."
8,"Not even tryna suck the dude of but JJ earns way more money than that. Think of all his businesses, boxing company + his boxing earnings, prime, xix, sides, adidas sponsorship, sidemen clothing, YouTube channels, side+ and his music career (just went on a tour). Bro is clear"
9,Definitely fake lol
10,"In 2021 maybe, but in 2022 id say ksi."
11,I think jj has a net worth of at least 25-20 mil by now
12,Jake does not have 53 Million follows💀 WTF is this???
13,"The thing about JJ is that he doesn’t make money just because he wants to make money. He pursues at whatever he’s passionate about, and in turn it makes him money. Jake on the other hand, does everything FOR money. He did try to scam people a lot of times, most recently using NFTs so we know where his allegiances are."
14,JJ can only beat jake if he opens fifa packs 🔥🐐
15,"""Lets check his monthly listeners"""
16,JJ's contract with BMG made him lose money from his videos and jake has been busy boxing and shit while JJ is out here giving us the best contents
17,"Ik has sidemen,sides,xix vodka,prime a deal with ardidas and a record deal their is no way he’s only at 10 M the man lost a couple Mil on crypto I think he would be a bit more upset if he lost 20% of his networth"
18,This is definitely outdated as of right now JJ’s net worth is easily over $35M I could only imagine what it is now after seeing how much of a success prime is not to mention his sold out shows/ boxing events.
19,Looks kinda obvious that someone is using bots 👀👀👀
20,"I mean jj manager himself said that jj has rejected almost 150-200 million in offers, so this doesn't really matter."
21,because of crypto obviously 🙄
22,Net worths are probably fake for both of them
23,He made more than 10m lol
24,American magazine favours american person in shock decision.
25,Jake is higher
26,10mil in one year is still insane I don’t get why you guys think everything he does has to be better than jake although I don’t see how jake earned that 45m cos it certainly wasn’t his boxing ppvs lol but if it’s legit fair play
27,It’s wrong Forbes literally came out last yr and said jj made 19+ million just from his music
28,These things are not reliable
29,It also says jj has more engagement
30,Ffffff
31,I feel like this is oncorrect...
32,Does tate too featured???
33,"Who just decided ""yeah ksi made 10 million this year""?
Did they ask JJ or just guess."
34,Who cares
35,lol incredibly irrelevant
36,At least JJ is happy doing what he’s doing. Jake is an empty shell of a person who’s only interested in materialistic things
37,"It may have been like that in 2021. But this year Jj unveiled prime and got it affiliated with arsenal , has released charting tunes, done music performances at large venues and ran a successful boxing event that sold out and it’s only September like. We’ll have to see🤷‍♂️"
38,"I get that America is wayyy bigger than the UK but it still baffles me that Jake has more followers than JJ, when JJ engages with his followers far more than Jake."
39,American influence on yt is bigger than uk.
40,Good match
41,How is jake making his money?
42,He has more engagement
43,who cares bro
44,Utter Bullshit
45,Anyway look at the engagement score proves people get bored of jakes ‘content’
46,Not surprised after jj lost most of it in Crypto
47,"All the did was google “ksi gross YouTube earnings” and that’s what came up, the way he hands out money shows that 10 mil is maybe from 3 months of not so solid work lmao. Thing that to my knowledge he’s making money off of: sidemen (all related channels), music, boxing, sponsorships (adidas, that headphone brand) prime, and there are probably more im not thinking of, all Jake has done is scam his followers and back out of fights"
48,"for someone who doesn’t earn income off of his own youtube channel, that’s still a lot of money"
49,man; 2023 is goin to be something big for either of them......BIG UP 2023!!!
50,Ksi clears i dont care about money
51,"So one of these dudes is scamming people and being just a general piece of shit and the other one tries to create content and inspire his fans for free. Moneys not important in their case, it's who can better sleep at night"
52,"Jake's such a good guy if you get to know him and follow him, I mean you don't see JJ making websites to scam, I mean teach his fans then deleting the website after everyone pays and running away"
53,I'm  BROKE...soo.... I can't pay attention to this
54,Earning is going to change since he's going to start making money off his videos this September onward
55,"Hey guys here’s a swell idea, what if we don’t measure how “top” a creator is by the amount of money they make? Because Will Smith would always be on top"
56,only 1 of them lacks knowledge strength and integrity
57,Impossible he lost 3 mil on Luna he isn’t gonna gamble away 30% of his worth
58,Check his monthly listeners bro
59,He’s not a creator tho. He just has fake fights.
60,KSI has more total followers than Jake. This list is fucked.
61,I think that jj values his fans as people and not numbers
62,JJ said he lost 5m in crypto itself there is no way he only made 10m
63,"Jj does half his content for free and Jake gets mad views from clickbait, and his scam university"
64,"If I wanted to watch 2 pussies Duke it out, I'd just go to your moms"
65,I swear the followers are supposed to be more on jjs part
66,Heard something about jake paul did a scam of some kind not sure though
67,Does it really matter?
68,That entire list was garbage lmao. But at least they put Mr beast in first place
69,This is based mostly on followers
70,Wasn't this in 2021..?
71,BRO THE QUEEN JUST DIED
72,Some chump’s opinion and the actual YouTube numbers and everything else really don’t determine who’s really higher 🙌
73,"I’m not surprised jakes engagement rate is lower, most people are too afraid to show they’re a fan of Jake Paul, even though I guarantee a huge percentage of JJ’s fans enjoy watching content Jake is part of"
74,Jj loses so much money i say the money part is accurate HAAHHAHAHA
75,Common ksi L
76,i believe JJ is ahead in all except for total earnings
77,"Jake Paul has WELL diversified his income. He co-founded a sports betting startup which has raised over 50 million dollars from the likes of Travis Scott and Simplebet and has tens of millions of dollars invested in numerous start-ups And that isn’t even counting his fights which he earned millions from their pay-per-view on top of his initial payout. 

TL;DR: Jake is making more money as a businessman and boxer than he did running his failing content house."
78,It’s not all about the money it’s about the fan base
79,Are Jake even uploading videos?
80,"Something in that list has to be wrong, I doubt that Jake has more money than JJ considering that JJ seems to live a more humble lifestyle + JJ has plenty of businesses (Sidemen, YT, Music, Prime, XIX Vodka, etc.)"
81,Who really cares though? At least JJ doesn’t have to leach off of other people’s fame in order to stay somewhat relevant.
82,biased AF
83,This is all nonsense anyways
84,"Guess Jake’s the A-Side, sorry JJ (I’m not serious at all but I need him to come to America so downvote the shit out of me if it helps you sell it better.)"
85,Hm
86,"They got it wrong how is it only 10M when he actually wasted around 10M in crypto, he must have made a-lot"
87,"ksi has over 75 million followers between his main channel, second channel, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. Jake Paul has just about 60 million across the same platforms. how did they get that so wrong?"
88,"1. How do they mean by engagement
2. Why tf is jake high than him
3. What does it mean by entrepreneurship and how does jake have the same amount as jj"
89,whos more liked by the people 🤷‍♂️
90,Jj will earn more this year I think (if Jake Paul doesn’t have other methods of income) but jj didn’t earn from his channel till September so idk if Jake Paul fights in October and not December then jj will earn more
91,Jake will shit on ksi (wrt Revenue made in 2022) when he fights silva.
92,People getting mad at estimations because Forbes estimations doesn't match their estimations.
93,Jake paul:Alr Less check the most hated celebrities list then?
94,the real question no one dared to ask
95,Lol
96,Suck his dick while youre at it
97,Exactly they both rich so ima be salty regardless lmao
98,Probably included his crypto loss lol
99,his own hydration drink and so many sold out concerts and a whole o2
100,Idk if you seen it says 2021
