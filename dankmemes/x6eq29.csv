95,"In Japanese you say ""hello"" as 'ohayou' which is pronounced just like Ohio. 

Assuming it is in the morning, there's different greetings for different times of day. And you'd probably want to say ohayougozaimasu, because otherwise it's weirdly informal."
96,"Hey! I am learning to speak Japanese and I like to see proper stuff 

Incidentally I am also a weeb but... ah crap I got nothin'"
97,"Nah, just you."
98,I'm pretty sure non weebs would be much more likely to know konnichiha than ohayou
99,"So true story, I got stationed in Japan when I was in the military and went over not knowing a word of Japanese other than arigato and konnichiwa. 

So first day there and I went to get a haircut. Super nice Japanese lady, I say ‚ÄúKonnichiwa‚Äù and she says ‚ÄúOhaiyo‚Äù because it‚Äôs like 9 in the morning. 

Me, being from Michigan, no shit responded ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs really close, I‚Äôm from Michigan, not Ohio. How did you guess?‚Äù 

Was a very embarrassing moment when someone explained that Ohaiyo means ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù vs konnichawa meaning ‚Äúgood afternoon.‚Äù"
100,If we beat ohio state this year I might cry tears of joy
