1,"Government be like ""nooooo dont raise wages, it goes against our austerity plans, we want to fix the economirnooooo by not doing anything"""
2,took me forever to learn that this template was from DS3 Yhorm the giant fanart
3,Ironically this gives me hope. I beat that boss.
4,"My accounts in the negatives for the first time in my life and honestly I've run out of fucks to give. Like what are they gunna do, take my remaining zero dollars? Force the one slice of bread out of my stomach as collateral?"
5,"Meanwhile some kid playing with toys on YouTube is a millionaire. I don't hate the kid, good for him.

But sometimes I wonder why am I even trying."
6,"I just learned that in the UK there's a grass roots movement happening where the goal is for 1million people to not pay their energy bills because energy companies are profiting more than ever in a time when the people are being told ""resources are scarce"". If that were true, profit would stay the same while prices increased but profit is at an all-time high. We should keep energy companies in check in the US as well."
7,I legit don't understand the fact that hard working people get paid so less these days.... You can't buy even single house even though it should be common sense that even with minimum wage you should be able to live well but no... That's not the case.... Study for 22 years to get a job that's going to make you work insanely while paying you 10% of what you make for their company
8,Meme explaining Estonian life
9,YOU DIED
10,Aahh yhorm the giant good fellow
11,"Hope you don‚Äôt live in Germany. They‚Äôre about to have a verrrry cold, expensive winter."
12,Cant you just dodge roll and evade the bills or you're still new to this?
13,Well if you want it worked I‚Äôm sure you find that in this dark corner of the internet.
14,I second this. Know so many good hardworking people even with uni degrees and skilled jobs that cannot get by in the current climate. The rich get even richer while 90% of us are going through hard times. Hate to see it :/
15,Don‚Äôt worry if you have 2 jobs you won‚Äôt be home and thus don‚Äôt need to heat it. Also you will be tired enough to sleep even when freezing.
16,"‚ÄúYou will get your ass worked, and you will love it‚Äù Klaus Schwab or any other rich tiggaf."
17,Energy company phoned me after I cancelled my direct debit and told them ill be paying it manually only for how much I could afford and they said if you don't pay your  ¬£600 debt then they'll charge a constantly increasing fee. I told them when will that be due and they said nothing for 4 minutes and just hung up. I've stopped giving a shit to this bs.
18,"Why do Americans call petrol ( or diesel ) ,which are liquid fuels gas?"
19,I‚Äôm gonna send this to my boss
20,"and then there‚Äôs always that gen x/millennial that‚Äôll always say that we have it lucky since we get a minimum wage that‚Äôs a few dollars higher, and if you adjust for inflation, technically our pay is almost worse, plus gas prices and all the other lovely bills"
21,"You know whats worse.
Its gonna take atleast 30 years for shit to calm down again.

We're so fucked."
22,"Me living in turkey: heh, first time? Amateurs."
23,"Simple solution, just adopt kids, get them jobs, steal their money, abandon them /s"
24,I'd work your ass
25,I'll work your ass üòè no homo üòâ
26,How do people cope with slaving some shitty jobs when there's dumb kids making 10x with silly social media or ethots or 'influencers'  . Think about the importance of nurses and how low they're paid or that recent vid in nyc minimum wage fastfood workers slaving for shit wage just to get harrased by some monkeys twerking and throwing stuff around . Rather suicide or be on welfare if i was in their position than slave for nothing.
27,"Stop working, and eat the billionaires for energy. Then redistribute their wealth and we can all live happily ever after. There's not even that many of them, it could be handled over a weekend."
28,"The world isn't ready to shift off of fossil fuels but the government has decided we will anyway. This is literally what people have been asking for, and now they're mad that supply is low and energy is expensive because the alternatives aren't mature enough yet. If we don't produce, then nations that Americans hate, like Russia and Saudi Arabia, will dictate who gets power, which is almost unbelievably stupid."
29,Thats why I quit my job and life on the state. I aint paying to work. I earn the same without work as when I work and pay for fuel
30,Wrong use of meme. Yhorm gets his ass whooped.
31,What is the source of this image?
32,"This meme is backwards, unless this some kind of flex of how good your job pays."
33,The boss in the image yhorm is actually really easy to kill haha
34,Biden
35,"Real talk, the jobs exist. Apply for jobs that pay more. Learn required skills, gain required certifications. BE WILLING TO RELOCATE."
36,Gain a better wage lmao
37,"Those jobs we don't want to do, because of shit pay and working conditions, they used to be filled by travellers and migrants. Covid paused our intake of what were basically slaves and we should be wary of starting that up again."
38,Vancouver right now
39,"Well, my username begs to differ"
40,Increase wages is negated by inflation. What Americans actually want is better social support and services and deprivatisation of essential services.... Otherwise you can rise minimum wages as much as you like with no long term impact
41,Yhorme need to make more money.
42,"I just realized something, Isnt this yhorm the giant from DS3?"
43,That's why i found job and i'm supporting financially my family
44,"They gave us all a 45 cent raise at work yesterday, then I get home and see Hulu is having a price increase from $12.99 to $14.99. There goes my raise lol."
45,Yhorm was a easy fight tho
46,I got pay waaayyyy more in the 80s than what jobs are advertising now. Nobody wants to pay anymore.
47,I was just reading 'lying still' movement in China where they refuse dictators Xi call for national pride to slave for xinas tech rise  or whatever nonsense the party spews and opt out of work force. Tho they created even more insectoid worker society of competitive long hour work days with only promise of slightly better consumerism opportunities . When consumerism is your best ideal to hope for then you arent even a human being.
48,Capitalism and it's failures.
49,"Life is more than just these things, my friend. I know it can seem really daunting and unfair (and a lot of the times it is), but take it at your own pace. A brighter tomorrow is there, just keep pushing"
50,"Americans ranting about how bad their country is nowadays, have you guys ever considered this situation is the ""good times"" for people from Latin America and merely a dream for people in Africa?

I mean, Gas nowadays is hard to come by at R$7 in Brazil, normally it's around R$5, the most basic cars here are costing over R$60.000, just my living (apartment, water, eletricity, internet, building maintenance) is more then R$1000, I have lunch everyday at my university because it's R$4,70, the food is terrible, but if I want to go to a cheap restaurant around here it'll be around R$15, and buying food is hard because I live next to the university, which is almost outside of the town, if I want to go to a good market the bus is R$6 and just a few things will be over R$100, a packet of rice is R$15, beans over R$20, meat (cheap) around R$25 a kg, here we work more then 4 months to the government, as they eat these 4 in taxes, which btw, are also a joke as YOU have to calculate them, and if you calculate them wrong, you're screwd.

Btw, I said all those prices because minimum wage is R$1200 a month, if it wasn't my parents getting 10x this they wouldn't be able to sustain me here."
51,just invest in $BBBY and you'll be fine üôèüèºüê∏‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
52,"Sounds like a California meme, things are pretty even over here in Florida"
53,U guys have it too easy
54,If you're American shut the fuck up
55,"It's not about hard work. It's about valuable work. If you can't afford your expenses, either spend less, or find more valuable work to do."
56,Oh man let me introduce you a country called Iran.
57,"Genuine question for you OP, how old are you?"
58,Living should be costly so that there will be fewer people who can afford it and stop doing it in order to stop overpopulation and ~~global warming~~ climate change. Eat ze bugs for they are cheaper and own nothing so you can be happy.
59,"LeTs RaIsE tHe MiNiMuM wAgE AgaIn, ThAt WeNt So WeLl LaSt TiMe..."
60,Try something other than cashier
61,The US of A already does that for me every day.
62,"Damnit, I came here to say that lol, cheers"
63,I posted my comment and was immediately met with yours... I actually felt a rush of depression. Oh well...
64,I will ass your work
65,Commas are important people
66,imagine being broke
67,"""If wages go up, prices will go up.""

This is only an absolute because we as a society refuse to challenge it in any way. There's an obvious relationship between wage costs and prices, but it's not 1 to 1 and it should not be treated as such.

Can't be posting all these record corporate profits then complain about hiking wages."
68,Oh they do plenty. They just keep on printing and investing for their own benefit
69,Yep. Tried beating him without the storm ruler playing that game. Gave up and just cheesed him.
70,There are no Storm Rulers in this version tho. Gg.
71,"They will one day send a dog to your house. Yiu will instinctively get attached to it. Then few months later they will take the dog away, just to hurt you."
72,"Nah they'll just charge you more and more overdraft fees because if you already have no money then fuck you, pay me for being broke peasant."
73,"Influencers, braindead drama content creators, ethots etc... or irl  criminal immigrants . Why dafuq would someone cope and bother with legit work just abuse welfare in such a clown world."
74,It‚Äôs about to get lit here soon. There are riots happening in 101 countries atm or over the last quarter.
75,In the US energy companies cannot raise prices at all unless the government approves it. Government regulated monopoly. Our 240v 30A chargers are still contracted at $0.07/kWh
76,"Please tell me more?

And show me where you found this out?"
77,">resources are scarce"". If that were true, profit would stay the same while prices increased but profit is at an all-time high. 

Why?"
78,Some guy commented on a post about min wage about how hes worked 22years in a trade and is only making 18 hr so its not fair that Wendy's had 20hr positions.
79,"This housing bubble isn't helping either. It costs too much to get a house, and if lawmakers try to lower housing prices, they immediately lose the vote of most people who own houses because their property values and resale values will drop. Double edged sword."
80,"> hard working people 

Your wage is directly proportional to how hard it is to replace you.

What's not to understand?"
81,0.1% *
82,"It's sadly the case in basically every country.

Working multiple full time jobs doesn't cover everything."
83,I almost chucked my controller until I finally used that weapon you grab in there that I thought was worthless
84,"I live in Italy under the alps. It is even worse, at least most of them can afford gas as they have a working economy"
85,We try but we keep getting one-shotted and sent back to the checkpoint respawn
86,"Only 90%? Wow

Skilled job in electricals, get paid nothing and I'm overworked"
87,Sounds more like a scam operator
88,"Gasoline. Petroleum. Same same but different. They're not calling Gas because it's a ""gas"", it is short for Gasoline"
89,"It really depends. Some young people (not rich kids) are doing very well in today's economy, and some aren't. I don't know enough about the majority-side to make a judgement."
90,"Yeah while influencers,onlyfans ""Content creators""(you know who),tik tokers and etc get Money for doing nothing we have to bite the dust"
91,You just invented capitalism
92,"Places like California are getting rid of their fossil fuels and then telling people they need to buy electric cars, and then shutting their pants and telling people not to charge said electric cars because there isn't enough electricity."
93,"Oh my god someone who isn‚Äôt a total fucktard, take my up vote sir."
94,"I think you're reading the meme wrong. Yhorm is towering over the ashen one here so he's much bigger than them, similar to how bills electricity is much more expensive than what wages give"
95,"You aren‚Äôt 100% wrong just like 98.9%, I have marketable skills and an education, along with military service and just 2 weeks ago finally got a new job paying $20 hr (I was previously making $14) that pays for my apartment and utilities (I‚Äôm an apartment maintenance tech) it took till I was 32 (I lived in poverty the past 10 years barely paying my bills on time or floating them) and I had to move 3 hours across Pennsylvania‚Ä¶ the jobs do exist, it‚Äôs just not easy to get them like you are implying (I had to apply to over 150 jobs over 2 years just to find this one lol) companies can pay more they don‚Äôt want to, this isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù it‚Äôs about the giant corporations who are exploiting and abusing working people"
96,It shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to just be able to be alive
97,"Easier said than done especially if you‚Äôre already low on time/money. You also have to invest in knowing how to play the job application game because it‚Äôs just getting more and more complex.

Like, you‚Äôre not wrong but that advice is pretty tone deaf."
98,"Yeah fuck those guys getting paid minimum wage, so what if they're essential and if they all got better jobs then we'd be fucked?"
99,"True, poor people just need to make more money smhüòÆ‚Äçüí®"
100,gain a life lmao
