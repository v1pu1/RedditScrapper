4,Honestly ... i couldn‘t care less about ukraine/russia BS ... Your government should care about the people of your country and not some bombed shithole filled with russian scum. Same goes for my country ... Fuckers want to keep sending money there and what about us ? jack shit i guess.
5,Lots of corps used Ukraine as tax shelter and for sweatshop labor. Thats why they want to get it back its one of the wests cheap labor zones.  They had to scurry out like cockroaches when the tanks crossed the border and they are mad about it.
6,"The biggest irony i find is the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" ... the irony ? It was made by a War Thunder Youtube/streamer to sell merch. xD i've been playing that game for almost 10 years XD."
