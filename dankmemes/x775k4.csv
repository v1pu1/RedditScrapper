0,"Cats usually come back thanks to food and love (in that order), dogs that have been restrained do flee, but properly educated they do come back too. I always left the door open for my dogs and they always came back.

I have a question for you, what is the natural habitat of a dog? A house? A garden? A forest? What is the natural habitat of an animal that nature is in no way responsible for the creation?"
1,"So you wouldn't want to escape a lifetime prison, just because the guard is friendly?"
2,"Also they get told where and when to shit or have walk, they are bored most time of the day because the owner is at work, they can not hunt neither live in their natural environment or live under their own species.
Little bonus for some dogs who are suffering constant pain because humans think they look cute, so they were bred to be disabled.

Ya i don't understand why they want to escape that."

8,"We have a 40-acre farm and the animals are free to roam. Even the horse rarely left the property when he unintentionally became free-range after a gate broke. As a plus, we were able to teach the dogs to poop in the woods."
9,"Yea, dogs die in the wild when alone. Pretty much always. They are reliant on humans, or at least other dogs. But you see how stray dogs look. Not very happy nor healthy."
10,"And don't forget, humans chopping their pp off."
11,"Cats are meant to be outside as much as a dogs. As in, they can be perfectly happy inside as long as your house isn’t boring to them."
