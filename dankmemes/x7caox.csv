0,Twitter in general is festering cesspool of garbage
1,Do you guys know Persona? How evil people have their ‚Äûpalaces‚Äú where they think they are king and spread their hatred? Twitter is that palace.
2,Imagine using twitter...
3,"Twitter anyone terrifies me to be honest. 

Twitter straights are just as bad as twitter gays in my experience."
4,"I'm bisexual in an extremely conservative school, and I've never had a problem. Why? Because I don't announce it to everyone I meet. I'm out, it's not like it's a secret, but I don't daily do stereotypical ""gay"" things. Sure I'd love the school to be more accepting, but I also understand that's not exactly something that I will change by being annoyingly obnoxious with my gayness."
5,"As a black man, black twitter is also horrifying. They remind me more of the KKK than activists tbh"
6,"twitter gays and tiktok transgenders. don't ever listen to them, they are such an embarrassment for our community.."
7,"It‚Äôs the Twitter anything that are the problem, Twitter is the problem"
8,"It's the twitter ~~gays~~ that are assholes


(almost everyone on twitter is)"
9,FINALLY SOMEONE REALISES THAT
10,"Everyone on Twitter sucks. The straights are just as bad as the gays over there imo. I'm gay though so maybe I notice the discrimination from the straights more than y'all do. Something about the way Twitter works just attracts the worst people & gives them a platform/following. Only place worse rn is 4chan for toxicity. Reddit has some shitty parts too, but I'd say with confidence that Reddit is less toxic than either by far."
11,"I get what your saying, and I agree"
12,"~~Gay and trans~~ people are completely fine, It's the twitter ~~gays~~ that are assholes"
13,why is this sub so political?
14,"And some people, I would argue a lot more than homosexuals, make heterosexuality there whole personality.

A flamboyant gay guy who‚Äôs proud of being able to express his sexuality without discrimination is 100 times better than a fat redneck with a nutsack on his f150 pickup truck."
15,"""oh so gay people can't be on Twitter now? Cuz that'd make them twitter gay and they're an asshole?"""
16,"Some gays have the gayness as a part of their personality. For some the gay *is* their personality. Twitter gays are neither of the these, for while they spend an awkward amount of time screaming their homosexuality into the internet, Twitter is an absolute cesspool and using it regularly requires you to either be trash or a human raccoon"
17,Both bad
18,Someone had to say it
19,\[deleted\]
20,I agree with this. The worst of the bunch are the ones found frequenting forms of social media. Twitter and tik tok being the worst
21,This‚Ä¶ this makes me happy :)
22,you have to remember. twitter became the cesspool that it is because they ran from tumblr
23,I think everybody agreed with this
24,Agreed
25,"I have seen the dumbest, most ignorant and toxic takes there and the stupidest part is that their followers agree w them"
26,Great game and great theory
27,"Somehow the palaces of great, intense malice are more understandable than twitter."
28,[deleted]
29,I use it to laugh at people and their low intelligence takes
30,So twitter users?
31,This isn‚Äôt even political?
32,No because I really don‚Äôt care how much you love sucking your own gender off and the so called redneck is going along with being heterosexual since it is normal in about every country
33,"Truer words have never been spoken, twitter people are nothing but vermin, no matter who or what they are."
34,"And some people, I would argue a lot more than homosexuals, make heterosexuality there whole personality.

A flamboyant gay guy who‚Äôs proud of being able to express his sexuality without discrimination is 100 times better than a fat redneck with a nutsack on his f150 pickup truck."
35,corporate America doesn't  (yet)
36,I recently play Persona 5 Royale. It‚Äòs awesome and my dumbass overlooked it for too long because i somehow thought it‚Äòs a Beat ‚Äòem up
37,What‚Äòs that
38,"Being homosexual is also normal. You know what‚Äôs not normal? Hanging nuts on the back of your truck and buying products marketed as manly to proof how much you love women. 

I bet most of these are over compensating homosexual thoughts, like a good portion of homophobes‚Ä¶"
39,Maybe to you that‚Äôs obnoxious but never once did he announce how straight he is and how proud he is to be straight and have a flag and have a month dedicated to him for being straight. He‚Äôs living his life.
40,I mean truck nuts are pretty funny but ya know y‚Äôall gotta get offended at everythingü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
41,"Never once did the straight guy get called a slur just because he's straight. He didn't have to live years of his life in shame or anger because he was born different to a lot of other people. Pride month exists because so many people in the lgbtq+ community feel alone, especially young queer people. I've never felt more welcome than around other queer people during pride month. And the flags? What's even wrong with them? It's an easy way to let others know that you're a part of the community and personally I love my flag. I am trans, always will be trans and I'm proud of it. I spent years in denial and I'm over that, I'll fly my flag proudly until my fellow trans people aren't dying before they get access to the hormones and support that they so desperately need."
42,"Buullshit. There are soo many people who do EXACTLY that. You‚Äôre just in a bubble.

And straights don‚Äôt need a month dedicated to them. They haven‚Äôt been opressed. What a shitty argument."
43,"It‚Äôs just weird af and childish. I am allowed to have that opinion, and im allowed to think that you look ridiculous and probably have a small dick when I see your pickup truck with nut sacks. If that opinion angers you‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs the one getting offended?"
44,"Straight people get called names too, sexuality is just your personal low-hanging fruit."
45,I‚Äôm sure there are people who do that. And it‚Äôs obnoxious. Just like everyone else.
46,Don‚Äôt have a pickup truck but I‚Äôm also entitled to my opinion about you getting offended as well I mean it goes both ways
47,"As you said, just like everyone else. So why do you present obnoxious people as a gay-related problem?

Furthermore, the stuff that‚Äôs considered ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù when it‚Äôs done by gays but is perfectly acceptable or ignored when it‚Äôs for heteros‚Ä¶"
48,You‚Äôre entitled to have a stupid opinion yes. Doesn‚Äôt make it any less stupid
49,I‚Äôm not associating it with all gays. Just like I‚Äôm not associating it with all straights.
50,I didn‚Äôt call your opinion stupid but here we are with you getting offended again
51,Commenting it under a post about ‚Äúannoying gay people‚Äù is directly associating it though‚Ä¶
52,"Sounds like you‚Äôre pretty upset about me calling your opinion stupid. 

What do I expect from someone who thinks hanging nuts from a pickup truck is not extremely cringe."
