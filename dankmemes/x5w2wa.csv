8,"I'm virgin by choice

9,"Thank you like bruh I had the option to lose mine like 2 times but I’m 17 and they were both druggies, making decisions that you think are bad shouldn’t be a requirement for adulthoods 

Edit: a social requirement"

28,"Sex isn't good enough to compromise who you are and who you want to be, a committed relationship can be amazing, sex by itself just feels good and we both know you can do better with your life than hedonism"
