1,Jeffrey Epstein when his whiskey has aged 18 years
2,I'll take that 9 years old please
3,So what's going on with him?
4,I like my whisky like how i like my women.... 12 years old
5,Lol who gives a shit
6,"Actually, regarding whiskey or scotch, I wouldn't want anything over 18. hahah But seriously, the taste gets very general and loses a lot of character when you age whiskey or scotch over 18 years. I generally buy one that is 14yr to 18yr."
7,"Here my Grace, a 12 year old girl

Viserys: hell no I have standards bring me the 14 year old one"
8,"I literally laughed out loud, thank you for this."
9,"Real question, why is his face so wide??? It gets wider with age. Is it alcoholism???"
10,"To be fair, If I was an famous award-winning handsome multi-millionaire actor I would definitely be doing hookers and cocaine all day every day so I really can't fault the man for at least trying to have a somewhat regular relationship."
11,u/savevideo
12,"I mean, they all had to have known they wonâ€™t last past 25 with him. They both got what they wanted from each other. 

I think itâ€™s kinda gross he does that, but heâ€™s not breaking any laws is he?"
13,[everyone who makes these memes about Leo and his stunningly beautiful young girlfriends ](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/096/564/2f7.jpg)
14,People need better things to focus on. Who cares about a celebrities dating life. He likes what he likes. Who cares
15,I mean I'm 24 so...
16,Iâ€™ll take 4 roses ðŸŒ¹ please
17,Peter Pan complex much?
18,His publicist is going to have him date a 40 year old woman for a couple months. Mark my words.
19,We need a meme of Leo dropping off the door after asking Rose her age.
20,Why do these fucking Leo memes seem older than the women he dates?
21,I like my women like I like my whisky... aged 14 years with a little coke.
22,"""Hey bartender, can i get an angel shot please?""
""Who?!""
""You""
""*shoots himself*"""
23,He is slowly approaching a creeper territory imo
24,I'd like to imagine the reason we're suddenly being bombarded by all these memes is because his most recent ex-gf paid for them to make fun of him.
25,Stop giving Leo shit and start laughing at the girls who fall for his bullshit.
26,Leo knows whatâ€™s up.
27,Leo is already scouting the 12 year olds for when he's in his 50's.
28,Leo likes his women like I like my cars. 19 to 25 years old with lots of undiagnosed issues
29,time to burn this man to the ground.
30,"Sorry Leo, you're starting to creep me out with the dating women under 25 thing. You're in your late 40's man...

Edit: I see I've angered the Leo fans. Sorry not sorry. It's creepy dating someone 20+ years younger than you. It's also very creepy that he won't stay dating a woman that's over 25. I'm aware they are ""consenting adults."" It doesn't make it any less creepy."
31,"Whiskey*

can't forget the e."
32,Man does Leo have it made
33,Say you donâ€™t have a girlfriend without saying you donâ€™t have a girlfriend.
34,When a woman turns 25 her brain realizes she doesnâ€™t want a gross old man like Leo
35,He doesn't like women that have fully developed brains.
36,Ok its a well done meme so I'll upvote but I'm over the Leo hates 25 year olds bit.  From now on automatic down vote for this shit

81,"Hell as long as theyâ€™re over 18 more power to him, Iâ€™m sure not a lot of consenting adult women would complain about being with Leonardo DiCaprio"
82,My man living his best life
83,"Good for him. People act like he's fucking children. The man is famous, let him enjoy the not-so-ripe fruits of his labor. I'd be doing the same exact thing."
84,"If the man can get hot young pussy at his age, more power to him. Seems like a lot of jealous men and bitter old women posting these memes"
85,That bloated pizza faced blob ain't no spring chicken
86,You misspelled 16
87,"Yes officier, this comment"
88,This guy whiskeys. But aged 10 years is where it's at
89,Matt Gaetz  likes his booze like he likes his women; 12 years old and mixed up with coke
90,"I'm Chris Hansen, why don't you take a seat over there"
91,"Right before the double digits? 

Good taste, that's they are soft and smooth. The older the whiskey gets the stronger and rougher it tastes."
92,I like my women like I like my whiskey. Aged 16 years and mixed up in coke.
93,I'll take my women like I'll take my scotch. 15 years old and handed to me by Matt Gaetz.

96,"Look, after all the people who came in and out of hollywood and then went on podcasts and talked all the absolute depraved crimes against God level stuff they saw people in the Hollywood machine do, I'm pretty surprised Leo is sleeping with women over 18 and not 12 year olds"
97,"He just broke up with his gf after she turned 25. Not weird, but he happens to have done that quite a few times before, so there seems to be a patternâ€¦"
98,"There is a ""leonardo dicaprio girlfriend chart"" that shows none of his many girlfriends was older than 25 during their relationship."
99,A couple years ago someone on Reddit made a chart showing that Leo has broken up with a girlfriend after they turned 25 three times. Recently he broke up with another girlfriend right after they turned 25 proving the post completely right.
100,I canâ€™t help but wonder if heâ€™s incredibly immature and too much to deal with. I think back to my experiences at 25 I matured a lot and set myself on course for where I am today.  Maybe his girlfriends are simply reaching the magical age where they donâ€™t want to put up with his shit anymore.
