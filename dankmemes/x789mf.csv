0,"Social media too

Edit: shit"
1,My man is really trying to justify his pr0n addiction
2,"Honestly a lot worse. In any country with actual sex education, this is barely a problem. We’ve all learned how actual sex works and know how unrealistic porn is. But the amount of young girls having completely unrealistic expectations of how dating and relationships have to work I mean my god… “but in all the romantic movies it works that way! You’re just lazy/bad/unromantic/whatever…”

Edit: oh god all the nofap cultists here… fuck off"
3,Yeah so many little girls see Disney princess movies and think they need that perfect prince
4,"They all have unrealistic expectations. Remember that what you’re reading/seeing is likely (mostly) made up/edited in some way, shape, or form. Thus, I wouldn’t take that kinda crap seriously"
5,"(outside of romance/relationships/sex) even though i know it isn't how it works in real life, the internet has ruined how i think people will respond to me in person, especially Twitter."
6,Romantic movies are more of an appropriate fap.
7,True. Both are bad.
8,"both are true, but porn is much less healthy, and it only gets worse the more you consume"
9,"S teir meme. The concept of love and sex is constantly fucked by ANY media, not just porn. Couldn't agree more lol"
10,"Ah yes, wanting an emotionally stable connection with your partner is ABSOLUTELY the same as wanting to bang your step daughter. 


OP, I will die on this hill."
11,The top panel isn’t incorrect just because the stuff in the bottom panel is bad as well.
12,"Pop music, anime, deodorant commercials"
13,100%
14,"Just say you're a coomer

Also ""drowning boat"" haha"
15,Whose gonna tell him what the unrealistic exceptions are referring to?
16,But he drew her before the boat sank?
17,this is the biggest cope i’ve seen today
18,Don jon ?
19,"Honestly it's everything in realization that when it comes down to it, it's not realistic."
20,Lol coomer.
21,Ah yes watching a girl with traits I specificity searched for getting raw dogged is the same as watching titanic
22,Oh shit
23,U stupid?
24,And some people TV addiction
25,"No, he's just saying that porn isn't the only cause of this problem, there are more causes, porn being one of them (or at least I guess. I'm not OP)."
26,"Well, he made a convincing argument."
27,"""What do you mean a guy won't chase me around and stand under the rain holding a boom box telling me how he is going to marry me after we move to his castle in an unspecified european country?"""

29,"Now that's Twitter for ya. If I went by their standards would nobody stay around in my life. But some do for some unknown reason. 

Just enjoy the ride while if lasts, and avoid Twitter"
30,"Instructions unclear, I'm now banned from AMC movies"
31,Why’d I read “costume”
32,"Of course, because having unrealistic expectations of your partner is just more healthy for you as it is for your partner than porn."
33,"Don't mind him, OP is a porn addict trying to justify his addiction"
34,That is not what he said at all
35,I swear man these fucking deodorant commercials need to be stopped
36,?
37,Yes
38,Nah I'm not
39,And you guys your Reddit addiction.
40,Rejection.
41,if thats what you like then why not
42,Are you trying to say porn doesn't give unrealistic expectations for a partner?
43,"No he is saying that there is not only porn that change the video view of sex and romantic interaction by setting impossible standards. And while we talk about how unrealistic and unhealthy it is, we don’t talk about the constant 24h of “perfect” people the media bombards us with."
44,Dick sizes and women cumming as soon as you touch them
45,What’s 9+10
46,"No, I'm saying that both things are on the same level and not that something ""less"" than the other"
47,We show us always the most beautiful and “happy” person in ads or tv series and that also ruins love relationships and sex by setting impossible standards.
48,"Oh, the airbrushed perfection of social media is also unrealistic and sets bad standards.  I agree completely.  

I do think that lumping all romantic literature together and saying it's just as harmful as porn is untrue. Have you read any romance novels? Any that have been written in the past ten years?


*edit: a word"
49,21
50,"I beg to differ, that's a very naive take. Portrayal of love and romance is a form of art and it is expression and reflection of how people perceive love. And setting impossible standards, by making chessy movies doesn't ruin other relations just like how writing a great poem doesn't ruin other poems. Dude is comparing a scat art on a dumpster with painting.


But it depends on your perspectives, so I guess debating this won't lead to anything productive."
51,I didn’t talk about romantic litterature
52,You stupid
53,"I was talking more about the impossible beauty standard than the Romeo and Juliet type romance. Even if we don’t want it, beauty is a very toxic thing for teenagers now."
54,Nah
55,">I was talking more about the impossible beauty standard than the Romeo and Juliet type romance.

Understandable. I was talking about the latter. 

>Even if we don’t want it, beauty is a very toxic thing for teenagers now.

I am in my 20s. So very unacquainted with the teenage culture."
56,I am still young but I know not to hangout with those type of people. They are toxic and I see way too much of them.
