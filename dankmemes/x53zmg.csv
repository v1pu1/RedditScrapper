1,What game is this
2,"Is that my boy Raziel?! More Soul Reaver memes, plz."
3,I don't understand the structure of the meme
4,I only came here because I was trying to remember what game this was.
5,"I know this is Reddit and a meme *but*:

Monkey pox is spread through physical contact, not exclusively sex.

You can give someone a hug and catch it, probably.

However, it‚Äôs true the homosexual male couples (or more specifically anal sex that they are likely to have) cause STD to spread more easily than oral or vaginal sex due to how fragile the inside of the rectum is; it‚Äôs more likely for a STD to get into the bloodstream through anal.

Sex Ed could help fix that, though. 

TL;DR: Monkey pox isn‚Äôt an STD.

Edit: since people are still replying to this here‚Äôs a CDC article about [Monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention/sexual-health.html)"
6,This meme is a confusing mess.
7,"According to some news I saw most of the reported cases were gay men.

But the biggest problem with calling it a gay disease is not only that the ""gay community will suffer prejudice"".

The biggest problem is that people who are not gay will think they don't have to worry about it at all. And also, if an heterosexual man catches it he might be be ""afraid"" to let others know because""they will think he had sex with men"".

So yeah, while gay people might suffer if we call it a gay disease, other consequences can come from it, neither of which are good"
8,I'm still waiting how two kids and a dog got monkeypox üòî
9,"even if he was tactless, it is better to aknowledge the groups most at risk for catching and spreading the disease than to stigmatize talking about the relation. men knowing this and avoiding promiscuous activity with strangers or partners known to have it will reduce the spread of monkeypox. stigmatizing it will mean less are informed about the risks"
10,Steven's three brain cells were working really hard to come up with this diarrhea of a tweet
11,God damn. Crowder is so ignorant
12,"Most of the news articles etc. I've seen have said that monkeypox is spread primarily by MSM (""men who have sex with men"").

The reason they don't call it a ""gay virus"" is because that's offensive and not helpful. They don't call measles a ""dumbass virus"", even though it's primarily spread by dumbasses"
13,What is the name of that video game?
14,"I did not expect to see Legacy of Kain, well at all again to be honest."
15,Is this legacy of kain?
16,Anal isn‚Äôt inherently gay. Straight men and women do it
17,"It‚Äôs spreading almost exclusively among gay men‚Ä¶*for now*.

That‚Äôs the key people are willfully blind to. You might feel completely safe from Monkeypox until there‚Äôs a kindergarten outbreak of it because the kids spit in each others faces, and *then* it‚Äôll be in the general populace"
18,"It's the fucking 1980s Reagan era AIDS/HIV pandemonium all over again.

For the last fucking time this isn't a gay disease, homophobes/bigots are just cherry picking data from researchers findings to solely place the blame on the LGBTQ+ community!"
19,"I can't believe I used to be a kid in middle school who thought Steven Crowder spoke ""facts"". Looking back, he really was just a guy who picked on college students who didn't know any better."
20,Man Twitter isn‚Äôt usually funny but hell it has its moments
21,monkeypox is a disease
22,"None of these idiots lived through the 80's aids hysteria I take it.  On second thought, they are that stupid."
23,Idiots like this guy genuinely make me fear for the day the first children get infected
24,Right wingers are cringe frankly
25,"Louder with Chowder


I prefer clam"
26,"STD means sexually transmitted disease. It doesn't mean it can't be spread via a non sexual way. The last stat I heard was 95% of the spread was from gay sex.

Corona came from China so I'd call it a Chinese virus.

Stop having so many orgys. Just a few."
27,"For the love of god Steven, come out of the closet already.."
28,How is all that people verified damn
29,Honestly every time I see Steven crowder I lose brain cells
30,"If it's called monkeypox and affects primates, then why does it affect humans? Checkmate Christians."
31,Wouldn't Crowder be the mothership of monkeypox?
32,I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶is that KANE THE SOUL REAVER?!
33,"Fuck is that soul reaver, now I feel old."
34,Ok thanks reddit
35,"The fact the world is recovering fron covid, then comes along monkey pox. The world cant even catch a break"
36,Absolutely outrageous
37,Its spread through anal so either you want aids or your gey
38,"Yes it‚Äôs technically not a ‚Äúgay disease‚Äù or ‚Äústd‚Äù, but HIV is also neither of those but that doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that (so far) the primary recipients of Tori‚Äôs have mainly been gay men and in most cases it seems to be a very specific subsection of highly promiscuous gay men (at least from a large portion of be personal stories I could find)
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs homophobic or anything to focus resources or attention on the primary population  been affected by an epidemic, that‚Äôs just common sense for an epidemiologist.
Like, if a disease was primarily spreading among nursing homes it wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúageist‚Äù to focus resources there or ‚Äúracist‚Äù if an disease was priming affecting a minority population and we tried to focus on treating them first.

When a disease happens and has a general ‚Äúmost likely to be infected‚Äù group, avoiding talking about it or focusing on it only make things worse in the long run. In the 80s conservatives avoided talking about aids because they were homophobic, now progressives want to avoid talking about it because they don‚Äôt wanna be seen as homophone. Both positions hurt gay men in the long run and are thoroughly anti-science positions
Also before anyone jumps down my thrown I‚Äôm a member of the lgbt community"
39,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver or maybe part 2 idk but thats definitely Raziel
40,"The structure is: Conservative said thing, thing is bad, hurr durr.

The statement is largely true, and more a matter of optics and opinions."
41,"same, you end up finding put? artstyle looks interesting, and the quote intrigues me"
42,"Like. It has spread almost exclusively through anal intercourse. 

It's not the only way it spreads, and can spread. But it's basically the only way it's currently spreading. Similarly to HIV. HIV does not only spread through intercourse, but that's historically how it has spread.

I'll say that, if it chiefly spreads through sex. I'm not worried for myself.

Why?

Because I use Reddit."
43,"If that is the case, do herpes count as STD? What about HIV? Not challenging you, just curious about the definition of STD. According to this logic, since most commonly recognised STD have a non-sexual way of transmission, they can no longer be classified as STD."
44,"It's also relevant that the gay community is generally more sexually promiscuous, and they have more sexual partners than straight counterparts. They also use protection less often. All definitely contributing."
45,"Wait a second, if a disease can be sexually transmitted, would that not make it a sexually transmitted disease? Reddit hive minds at work."
46,"Wtf I've been fooled by news that it only spreads via sex

BTW do handshakes count?"
47,"AIDS is spread through contact with an infected persons bodily fluids. Not just sex. Does that not mean it‚Äôs a an STD?   

Both are majority spread through sex."
48,"its also condoms, gay men aren't given enough sex ed in schools because of conservative fear mongering about child indoctrination, and as such they aren't taught to wear condoms, even if there is no chance of pregnancy (as in male anal sex). this is what spread aids so vigourously in the gay community"
49,"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/06/monkeypox-cdc-report-gay-men-lgbt-spread-infection-outbreak/

I‚Äôll just leave this here"
50,therefore it must be a ‚Äúgay disease‚Äù (what the hell is a gay disease?)
51,"2 men can't have sex that's why it isn't an std DUH...

It the idiot sticking shit in their asses...thats why"
52,https://youtu.be/d7v638YqMUE
53,"The biggest problem with calling it a gay disease is...that it's not true? It's prevalent in gay people because anal intercourse is statistically more common amongst them, which makes them more vulnerable, but a straight person who does a lot of anal will be as vulnerable as a gay person who does a lot of anal. And of course, as you said, there are the possible social implications that aren't great at all"
54,[deleted]
55,"I used to be a hardcore republican and admired him. How fucking stupid I was, he is such a hypocrite and not to mention almost everything he spews out of his mouth is blatantly false and easily disproven."
56,"Good lord, how did me manage to grow two more!?!?"
57,Yeah lol
58,"Considering that the transmissibility is extremely low for non sexual activities, if there was a kindergarten outbreak, I'd be investigating the teachers for abuse."
59,It‚Äôs not a gay disease it just mostly spread through the gay community
60,cool üëç
61,Sexually transmitted disease***
62,Already happened
63,Pretty much anyone that points out an entire huge group of other people and calls them a 'cringe' is pretty fucking 'cringe' too.
64,What about bird flu? or swine flu? Or mad cow disease? Or chickenpox? That all affects humans too? Help me to understand your thought process here‚Ä¶
65,His name was Raziel
66,The game is old enough to drink
67,"Kayden, get off Reddit and study for your quiz next week."
68,Both times it was conservatives that framed it as a gay STD and screwed things up.
69,It's definitely soul reaver 2. My god i miss the legacy of kain series.
70,https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/x53zmg/you_must_hate_them/in0nh0m?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
71,Same
72,Gotta love it when Reddit bros with diamond hand avatars are the leading experts on epidemiology and virology
73,"The disease has been around for decades and has never been considered an STD until it spread in the gay community, chiefly because a super spreader event happened (gay rave were it spread a lot and gave it access to a lot more people fast). The event could have been any kind of human gathering where people get close, it happened to be a gay rave. Would it be called an STD if it spread in a church event? Would it be called a Christian disease? No. People are pushing for it to be associated with sex and gay men so that when it infects children they can say gays are raping children without saying it, as it has already happened with cases in the US"
74,"I believe one of the things that sets Monkeypox apart is just how infectious it is without sex.

Monkeypox patients develop these rashes that are highly infectious when touched before the scabs fall off. Merely hugging or shaking hands with the infected individual will cause someone to become infected if contact is made with these lesions. This is why people who deal with Monkeypox patients need to be wearing contact precautions. Plus, the rashes for Monkeypox tend to occur on the face, hands, and feet - not your genitalia. 

You can easily contrast this with HIV. You can hug and shake hands with someone who has HIV just fine without having to worry about becoming infected."
75,"Pretty sure that for a disease to be considered a STD it has to almost exclusively transmit through sexual contact. HIV can only be spread through unprotected sex or direct blood infection like with sharing needles. Monkeypox has far more ways to infect, it's just that sexual contact is much more effective"
76,Here‚Äôs a [Link](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention/sexual-health.html) to an article from the CDC if you want a source.
77,"Yes, shaking hands would count if you managed to make contact with the pustules while they‚Äôre still at their infectious stage. 

When the scabs fall off, then they‚Äôre pretty much no longer contagious."
78,Maintain basic personal hygiene and it is unlikely to spread through non sexual contact
79,The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention/sexual-health.html) says it not an STD.
80,"That‚Äôs bs. Everyone is taught to use condoms. Nobody says condoms should only be used for heterosexual intercourse. Don‚Äôt just make up things here. Nobody is purposely not instructing the poor gay men to not use them over fear of child indoctrination. Everyone learns about protection, some people just choose not to use condoms."
81,"*no one* is given enough sex Ed.

Everything I‚Äôve learned about sex comes from concerned me looking stuff up on the internet while bored, schools did nothing idk if it was even an elective.

It‚Äôs a serious issue, and I swear people don‚Äôt realize that plenty of kids are going to know what sex is by middle school so it‚Äôs not ruining them anyway."
82,"I could agree if yoylu said that we should inform people that anal sex has a higher risk of transmission than vaginal sex, but it's not like gay people are removed from the classroom whenever condoms are brought up.  Sex ed is generally lackluster, but everyone has been told to wear a condom. They could however go more in depth as to why, beyond just saying ""STDs"""
83,"Makes sense, people touch during sex. Another comment said the LGTBetc. Community has more sex than heterosexual ppl and I believe it."
84,"The thing is no ‚Äústraight man does anal as much as a gay man.‚Äù Gay people are at the 90th percentile when it comes to both of those things. Nobody has sex more than gay men, and nobody has anal sex more than them. It‚Äôs the natural side effect of two men being involved in the sexual intercourse instead of a woman who wouldn‚Äôt be as easy to sleep with. 

It‚Äôs not a gay disease, but it‚Äôs 99% found in gay men. Why play around with semantics when everyone knows gay people are in much greater danger and should be particularly warned about it because their lifestyle choices?"
85,"What the fuck are you on about, anyone can get AIDS including heterosexual people. Nothing about that is false. Do not spread misinformation that has potential to harm.

There is such a thing as fear mongering, and over selling fear on something but that is seperate from ""we shouldn't worry about unlikely diseases""."
86,"You‚Äôre an idiot lol

EDIT: in case you‚Äôre wondering the dude I replied to said only gay people get aids and that they don‚Äôt have to worry because it‚Äôs not an ‚Äúeveryone disease‚Äù"
87,Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted it‚Äôs admirable that you admit your mistakes
88,"Yeah i almost got red pilled in like 2015, trump and my girlfriend both helped me nope the hell out of that one.

I remember one of the things he said a lot that always was weird was how proud he was that he had never used a condom, very strange"
89,"Easily disproven? Disprove him, go on a debate with him. Im still waiting."
90,Those Alex Jones brain pills or some shit
91,"The transmissibility is so high for sex because it‚Äôs prolonged, *very* close contact. Of course if you‚Äôre grinding your sores up against someone‚Äôs skin and spitting in their mouths you‚Äôre gonna get it. But it hasn‚Äôt exclusively spread through sex, and it could easily mutate slightly to spread in other ways, including non sexual highly close contact like between kindergartners with no boundaries"
92,Now. The disease has been around for decades spreading through all kinds of people without being considered an STD or associated with anyone.
93,sexually transmitted benefits
94,"So I guess if the armchair medical experts in the comments are correct, those kids must have all done butt stuff in order to get infected."
95,Crowder‚Äôs type are pretty cringe.
96,So you're cringe too
97,"Knew I was wrong, didn‚Äôt Google anyway."
98,Tf is kayden
99,"dank, thanks"
100,happy cake day!
