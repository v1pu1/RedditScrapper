1,English is hard
2,Wut?
3,"Boy, I sure looked hard, but I still couldn’t find who asked"
4,"My cousin doesn’t know anything about how reforms work and which party is promoting them- she thinks college debt elimination is a “woke” issue and therefore, unimportant to the country. However, she thinks free school lunches are the utmost priority, even though the GOP has cut funding to them time and time again - including this summer because they didn’t want LGBT kids to eat food. 

People are idiots about politics and taxes - paying taxes is necessary for reforms like school lunches AND college debt, and Democrats are supporting both, but because of the GOP’s deflective propaganda, Trump supporters ignore that the GOP doesn’t spend a dime on reforms."
5,Wow.. I did not get that at all from the meme.
6,This ain’t it. This ain’t it at all.
