3,I heard your mom knows a lot about german trains.
4,Y'all clearly have never seen the absolute *pinnacle* of railways that is the Romanian railways. You'll grow a beard before getting to the destination.
5,‚ÄûInformationen zu RE7 nach Berlin Hauptbahnhof √ºber Berlin Ostkreuz Abfahrt 12:30 heute etwa 72 Minuten Sp√§ter. Wir bitten um Entschuldigung‚Äù Wir lieben es.
6,"Bruh, y'all have no right to complain. Just a couple countries east, you'll find the M√ÅV and the CFR. Worst railway systems in the entirety of Europe BY FAR."
7,"I agree,

It was a lot better 90 years ago"
8,Dieser Pfosten ist nun Eingentum der BRD
9,Can't be a late train if it's always cancelled

19,We don't say *trains* in Germany. We call it *VERKACKTE DRECKSBAHN ICH KOMME SCHON WIEDER ZUSP√ÑT WILLST DU MICH VERARSCHEN HALBE STUNDE ICH KAUFE MIR EIN VERFICKTES AUTO WAS SCHAUST DU SO BL√ñD BRAUCHST DU EINE AUF DIE FRESSE ODER WAS*. And I think it's beautiful.
20,"hey don't just talk about trains, all other public transport sucks equally"
21,Cancer > Deutsche Bahn
22,Basiert und fick-die-DB-pilliert
23,Bro all of Germany has train systems. Other countries only have train systems in their biggest cities if they even have one. Wir m√ºssen dankbarer sein.
24,Yeah the German economy is probably gonna tank big time within the next few years. Got to love that Deutsche is giving out sub prime loans like it's candy on Halloween.
25,Db is relatively pleasent when you can't get internet connection 3km out of the city
26,I‚Äôm British. Should I move to Germany?
27,I've been to many countries in Europe. When I arrived in Stuttgart and reached the train station and saw the cardboard paper with the codes and shit... I thought I was back in the stone ages.
28,"it'S bad, but the us train system is even worse"

43,Economy not for much longer i fear. gasüëç
44,Is germanys rail system bad? I lived there the last couple years and it generally worked for for me. There were a couple upsets but I did use the train a bunch
45,Now do one for the US. If it gets any worse we‚Äôre going to have a desperate need for Chinese and Irish.
46,German Bundeswehr: Sad doge
47,"The roads are very nice to use, compared to neighbouring countries"

57,Inch verstehe nur Bahnhof
58,Thank you for traveling with Deutsche Bahn
59,Same for America honestly
60,"German fact part 2: ‚Äûumfahren‚Äú is the opposite of ‚Äûumfahren‚Äú. it depends on where you put the emphasis. *um*fahren means running over, um*fahr*en means driving around. also you can tell them apart in a sentence; while ‚ÄûI drive around smth‚Äú means ‚Äûich umfahre etwas‚Äú, ‚ÄûI run over smth‚Äú means ‚Äûich fahre etwas um‚Äú"
61,Yo image sauce pls
62,"They said theyll be Finished with their Part of the North South Axis Railway before we Finish the Gotthard Tunnel.

We are done with our Tunnel.
Not one piece of rail for that was completed in Germany."
63,Kein 9‚Ç¨ Ticket mehr :(
64,I‚Äôll go in a couple weeks and everyone was telling me how awesome their trains were. Was that some kind of German humor that I didn‚Äôt get?
65,Is this how you summon the Germans?
66,"Just be glad you aren't here in Canada. Our government is like ""you people all have cars right?"""
67,"No economy anymore, after their energy costs 20x because they shut down all their nukes and made themselves dependent on Russian gas that they can't get."
68,Germanys economy is decreasing. So soon the train system and economy will be even.
69,That's so that when I'm on vacation I may enjoy driving through the autobahn.
70,"Yeah DB is pretty bad, but at least Germany isn't that desperately designed for everyone using their cars"
71,Fools we all know that both economy and train system are carried by German science being the world's finest
72,You have a train system? Laughs in American

96,"oh, is his mom jewish or something?"
97,"I know this is really REALLY old, but, ‚ÄúI like trains‚Äù"
98,"Last year I was waiting for hours on some backwater village in sub zero temperatures at night: ICE broke down, regionals just stopped for the day. By the time a train arrived I was frozen solid and going home with the early commuters of the next day.

On that station, I started researching about car ownership, cars and all."
99,Why are the train systems in Romania and Hungary so bad?
100,"Would you like to talk about ~~our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ~~ Albanian Railways?

Like seriously, you can't beat that. I've been to Durres a year ago and on the station I saw some pretty beat-up, ex-German suburban coaches. ""Probably scrap or part donors"", I thought. A day or a week later 2 of them dissapeared. ""Maybe they finally cut them up"". What a surprise, both of the missing cars came back with the first morning train.

Not to mention that the cars were often missing glass in the windows and locomotives sometimes didn't have headlights. And signals on the station were most definitely non-operational, hard for them to be when they were missing basically everything that could be sold for scrap."
