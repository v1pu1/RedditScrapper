6,When this happens in a one on one conversation my crippling social anxiety takes over and makes me think that they think I’m boring or that they don’t care about me and sometimes that’s why I ask that question. Other times in a whole group I think that maybe this person is feeling overshadowed by all the other people so I like to check in and make sure that everyone who wishes to speak in a conversation can get their part.
