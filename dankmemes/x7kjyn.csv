0,"Races as in elves hobbits and dwarves or race as in white people, black people, and Italians?"
1,"Tolkien was not a racist! How hard is it to understand that?
How tf do people get black people from orks? Because their skin colour? Ever noticed that the skin colour of orks is their least important physical characteristic?"
2,"Had a fun chat in another sub, the end result is ""if you don't like the new rings of power, you're racist"".  Then the comments got locked."
3,Wasn’t LotR literally written to essentially be a British or European mythology since Tolkien was disappointed they didn’t have their own? Like it makes sense why he wrote a highly European looking cast when you consider that
4,Amazon owns IMDB. They are literally deleting 1 star reviews.
5,"Usually people who compare current events to the novel “1984” haven’t read enough to find a more appropriate metaphor, if they have even bothered to read that book at all. 

(Animal Farm is WAY better)"
6,Got downvoted and called a nazi for bringing this up about The Witcher show.
7,The last thing I care about right now is skin color. I just want a good fucking story man.
8,"""Quietly confronts"" all I've heard about this new show is how it's ""fixing"" Tolkien's racism."
9,"Progressives read Tolkien and came away convinced that actually, the orcs are black people, and somehow *you're* the racist if you don't agree."
10,"I saw what Amazon did to the Wheel of Time, and as a result have net negative interest in any fantasy series they produce."
11,"I have no dog in this fight bc I do not give a shit about LOTR, but looper said it has 25 million viewers, so I don't think that's a flop..

""The Rings Of Power Viewership Numbers Confirm What We Suspected About Amazon Prime's Historic Bet"" https://www.looper.com/993579/the-rings-of-power-viewership-numbers-confirm-what-we-suspected-about-amazon-primes-historic-bet/"
12,"Ah yes. The typical media ""we're fighting racism by nitpicking racism stereotypes in every piece of mainstream entertainment"" moment."
13,What's actually bad about this? I've seen the first episode and it's fine. It's not amazing but it's not like it's garbage either. Why does everyone either want to hate or praise this?
14,"I actually thought it was ok so far. Not really the best, but definitely a bit more than watchable. I don't really see why people don't like it?"
15,"Look i can deal with allot of shit, but god dam give that dwarf a massive bushy beard or get the fuck out"
16,"Tolkien is rolling in his grave so hard right now he could become the next energy efficient power source, what with his entire legacy and all of his property and worldbuilding that he's done being torn down to pave way for whatever you call this bullshit."
17,"I’m a minority and I don’t understand the problem of having an all European looking cast. Isn’t European mythology have a big inspiration on Tolkien. Why does every show etc new to have a black, Asian, Hispanic, etc. And actually Asian and especially Hispanics are underrepresented while blacks are over represented. 

I find it annoying how they focus on representation more than the story. I can enjoy an all white show or movie like Friends or an all black cast like fresh prince. I could relate to those characters and the story because it’s well written and I look pass the their skin color. The annoying thing is now the representation is more important than the story, vision, etc. And there’s almost always a political message it’s getting annoying."
18,I don't understand the hate for the show.  People made it sound like it was the worst thing ever.  I've liked it so far.  Still a bit early to scream hate from the mountain tops.
19,"""QUIETLY""?"
20,"I sorta like it, sorta don't. I think I am just happy to get more lotr stuff. I would rather have a animated series with Angmar and the witchking but one can only dream."
21,I am a racist. I never hurt anyone for the color of their skin or ethnicity. But my old fashion way of thinking makes me racist. I should have known better when I wrote my novels. Please rewrite my novels but please take my name off of it when you do.
22,"The gate keeping is sooo stupid. 1: There are black people in the books... or you know at least presumed black (The haradrim).

2. There are canonical Half-elves... its totally reasonable to think there could be black half-elves (if you notice in Rings of Power, the elves that are definitely ""high elves"" are actually all white anyway so they're lore accurate haha)

3. It's set in the Second age I'm pretty sure after Morgoth messes up middle earth a bit... its totally reasonable to assume that this displaced people of color from their homes forcing interaction with other people and races.

Use some critical thinking people"
23,"As a casual LOTR fan and person of color I could honestly give a rats ass about the skin color of the actors. Elves are white cool, elves are black goes against lore but if the stories good who cares. At the end all that really matters if the stories worth watching this focus on race is kinda odd."
24,people who see race everywhere are racists themselves
25,"Tolkien was not racist and in fact opposed racist ideologies like the Nazis this is clear in the friendship of Legolas and Gimli two people who become the best of friends despite the history their races have,some people point out how he uses the word black saying that orcs have black skin but it’s literal,then there’s the Haradrim who are described as having dark skin,yes they are villains in the story but it’s stated it’s because their leaders were corrupted by Sauron and after the events of the story they become staunch allies of Gondor

All that being said I have been enjoying The Rings of Power"
26,"Honestly, the reason I'm not watching RoP is because of people who will call me racist/sexist if I don't like it. So much other content to spend my time on. I'll check RoP out when it's completed or cancelled."
27,TBH if the color of an actor's skin is bothering you in a fantasy setting where willful suspension of belief is key to enjoyment... I think you're watching movies wrong.
28,"It's strange how companies still haven't figured out that no one cares if you play around with the appearance of side characters or throw in one oddball casting but when you start ignoring the original designs for so many major characters, the fans will understandably be upset."
29,This post is about to end up on terrible facebook memes this is indeed a boomer moment
30,"Funniest shit is how you judge the show after two episodes. Also this: [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/lotr-rings-of-power-day-1-record-viewing-amazon-1235211790/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/lotr-rings-of-power-day-1-record-viewing-amazon-1235211790/). We changing the definition of flopping, or?"
31,OH LAWD
32,What the fuck is racial determinism
33,These things aren’t related. 1/10.
34,"That's what modern entertainment is, people hire activists instead of writers and then blame the inevitable flop on the fans by calling them every ist and phobe imaginable. Then act surprised as thr fans now hate the franchise who hates them.

Honestly I have not watched Rings of Power and am not going to. I am not gonna sit for hours watching unkilled writers who has not read a word of Tolkien butcher all my beloved 1-2nd age characters into parodies of themselves.
The similarion books will always be better than whatever soulless Tolkien flavored crap amazon can shit out.

Also where the duck are my bearded Dwarven ladies?"
35,"I watched the first episode and it was a snoozefest. They skipped over all the interesting parts and gave us boring dialogue scenes instead. I dont remember anything racist, unless you mean the humanoid races/species have unique characteristics -- like in every fantasy lore."
36,I think it's pretty good so far fwiw
37,Isn’t having races in Lord of the Rings the point for having realism and exploration of interactions between different groups rather than ignoring the idea and hope we don’t be zealots to anything not human?
38,"I'm not saying that disliking rings of power makes you a racist. You can dislike stuff. You can like stuff. You can even disagree on liking something! 

I've had some discussions about the show in other places about the plot, setting, pace, writing, etc. And some people likes it, including me, and some didn't. That's fine.

That all being said, it's very telling that most discourse about the show under this post is about a black elf, and a black dwarf. But not the black proto hobbit, because that would require actually watching the show since they didn't show up in the trailers lol."
39,For anyone who thinks Tolkien had a prejudiced bone in his body: https://www.elephantjournal.com/2011/08/what-j-r-r-tolkien-said-to-the-nazis-when-they-asked-if-he-was-jewish/
40,\> 1984 is when a private company makes economically motivated decisions for profit.
41,"Idk I thought the first two episodes were pretty good. dosen't fall far from the movies.

Edit: imma get downvotes fro this I just realized. But I really didn't think they were that bad. I enjoyed them"
42,"Gotta say I enjoyed the first two episodes. Felt like an adventure was happening instead of a yawn political, family soap opera...Sue me."
43,RoP didn’t fucking flop it got the same numbers as house of the dragon
44,"I don't know why people & companies talk about race at all. You diversified the cast. Fine. Everyone can see that (except for colorblind maybe). Talk about the show not the cast colour 

If you like the show, give your opinion about that. If you don't give the reason why. What does it have anything to do with the colour of cast. Why blame the ""wokeness"" on bad content. You can be ""woke"" and still have good content. Just blame the company for the bad content not it's drive for diversification. How can diversification be blamed for bad content. There's a fuckload of bad content out there so why is this any different. 

Also why can't people just honour an opinion without thinking it's based on prejudice. The counter to criticism can't always be ""you are racist"". I mean there are a lot of people who really are prejudiced but you can't just assume and accuse the person of it.

Companies have different departments for casting and story writing and direction. You can't blame the shortcomings of writing department on the casting department."
45,I mean they literally forced racism into the script by allocating the opposing factions new different races... 🤯
46,Mordor is the USSR imho
47,"One of the main points in LOTR was about overcoming racial differences between elves, dwarves and men"
48,"Idk if anyone here is complaining ab black actors, I just think it’s funny that people can tolerate fire-breathing lizards and snow trolls in their fantasy world but not more darkly complected people. 

It’s not that big of a stretch that there may be some skin color differences."
49,"Ill be honest, when i think of orcs, i think of the middle east."
50,"Elves don't exist anyway and it's not super hard to believe that there are some with different skin colour.  But the real reason is probably that those actors simply were the best during casting. Remember, it's not an animated series where you can create any skin colour you like, you have to take real persons."
51,Well if we go by tolkiens vision all the dwarves would be played by Jews and I’m guessing y’all would be mad about that too
52,"OP, based on your post history you seem way more bent out of shape about Rings of Power than the MSM"
53,It's confronting it quietly because nobody is seriously watching it.
54,"No Skinner, you're out of time, I'm out of touch."
55,"“Feels like we danced into a nightmare
 

We’re living 1984”


-Back to the future, Bastille"
56,"Orwell believed that books would be kept from us and the truth hidden from us. Huxley believed no one would want to read books and the truth would drown in a sea of irrelevance. 

Now living in 2022, one can see that a mixture of the two is happening in the world rn"
57,I don’t like the rop because it implies that before the third age there was some type of massive racial genocide
58,"When I first saw the first 2 episodes of rings of power, I didn't think much bad of it. I mocked the swimming until the ""miracle save"" of Galadriel, but I didn't fathom how poor the show's writing truly was until I was thinking about it again. Someone shook me away through the mention of the swimming scene, extended it to the ""casually travels to dwarfs"" and got me poking through all the poor writing in the story.

&#x200B;

After thinking about it, very little made sense. The elfs arriving at the dwarf city looked like they walked for 5 minutes (even wore the same clothes as the earlier scene), while the map showed a multiple day journey (also the wilds of middle earth is dangerous but they travel with just 2?). I never got explained why there's such a tight time schedule behind the forge plans. Galebrimbor also only asks about the rusty relationship with dwarfs when they actually arive, quite a dumb timing. Durin had a rightly grudge, as a proper dwarf, but the woman is just a bit to sassy ""marvel style entertainment"" for such a high fantasy setting. 

&#x200B;

But what perhaps frightens me most about the beginning of the series: Until now I was able to recognise poor writing quite easily. But for this serie it seemed good in first instance. Having the lord of the rings slower conversations was like a 'memberberry' effect, making me wrongfully think it could hold a candle to the lotr trilogy. They are either getting better at hiding poor writing, or the years have dumbed us viewers down enough that we are starting to become unresponsive to poor writing."
59,"It's cool that people of color are in TRoP. I don't mind. It's fine. I like some of the actors to boot, especially Durin's wife.

It's just kinda dark to think they probably all die out by the time of the Third Age"
60,"Netflix: Contains too much brainwashing narrative and people dislike it, let's continue with another."
61,Am I the only one hating on the white actors they cast for elves…like where all the Orlando Bloom or Lee Pace go
62,"Well, there is the concept of racial superiority in-universe. 

* The elves are pretty much better than everyone else at everything. 
* Also, if I remember correctly, there was this primordial human race, the Numenoreans, that were as good as the elves. At the time of LOTR, the purer is a human's Numenorean descent, the better they are. This does ring a bell."
63,It’s not crazy that a white guy wrote exclusively white characters.  People would lose their minds if a white dude tried to write a trans sci-fi epic.
64,I couldn't care less about diversity an this show. I only care about story.
65,Political Correctness Was a Mistake
66,Why is everyone talking about shit like this? A lot is happening in the world and people are busy getting mad about insignificant stuff... Tell me you are a sheep without saying it out loud.
67,"I honestly don’t understand what the problem is. The show isn’t a 12/10 but it’s nice. The costume looks like shit from time to time and some dialogues are terrible but it’s okay. Also, the original book is like 100 years old and had thousands of pages and the original Movies take around 10-12 hours to watch 3 of them. The pacing is fine, and everybody who complains about poc dwarves and women dwarves needs to touch some fucking grass"
68,"Its forced diversity. Some characters fit, like darkerish Skin Elves since they are Wood Elves. We dont have to talk about dark Skin Humans since they are lore in LOTR but Hobbits and Dwarves? Call me racist all you want but thats almost as bad as dark skin Vikings in the new show."
69,"I'd watch it if it wasnt on amazon, bezos can fuck right off"
70,"It's fine to have legitimate criticisms of the show, but like 80% of mainstream criticisms ARE racist. So many people hate it not because of writing or anything but rather because there are black dwarves. So basically, hating it doesn't make you racist, but hating it for a racist reason does make you racist."
71,Well they can manipulate IMDB. But if people get bored they won't watch it no matter what. This is a season 2 cancellation.
72,"I do believe there is one instance where Tolkien was pretty racist. And that is of the description of the far Haradrim coined with the gondorian nickname for them “half-trolls”. Although this may not be Tolkien’s beliefs very much so, but instead an enforcement of Gondor’s own demonisation of the Haradrim."
73,Or maybe its just a serie that was ment to entertain people but was decent instead of entertaining
74,"Unpopular opinion: I like ""Rings of Power"", and it has nothing to do with race."
75,I like the show. I am enjoying it.
76,"Ahh yes, it's definitely flopping because of the source material and not the implementation/not wanting to give Amazon money.

That's why Jackson's LoTR did so poorly as we remember."
77,It flopped? I watched the first 2 eps and thought it was decent.  *shrug*
78,I’m getting seriously pissed off at the fact there’s so many news outlets saying everything is racist. It’s truly annoying and I think people have just lost the meaning of racism. They think it’s to only Black people now and not to every other race in the world.
79,"They should've just made a sequel not a prequel.

Jump to the future, let's say 500 years. You can write black elves into the story as most of the elves went to other continents by that point. You can make new races if you want. Respect the source material and the fandom will probably go with it."
80,"Its actually very succesful, the series just gets bad reception"
81,So is it good or bad?? Just heard it announced and heard noob else.
82,Tolkien party wrote the books to have a mythical history in the UK because they lost their stories.
83,Black people can’t exist in fantasy world it’s unrealistic right
84,If u think that orcs are a depiction of black people im afraid YOU are the racist sir
85,Hollywood is now the alt left feminist woke mind’s propaganda machine
86,It’s fucking LOTR. If you diss it you are wrong. It’s a fact
87,I hope the guy who crashed to middle earth is one the Blue Wizard's it's most likely Gandalf but I hope its one the blues.
88,Damn why has this sub been infiltrated by ex-GG failsons.
89,"Only watched one episode, i dont hate the show, but I dont like it, no enjoyable character. For someone who hasnt read the books, story is confusing, (i know a bit of lore but mostly about morgoth (sauron master), the giant dragon and spider. I truly have like no idea what is happening, but i should rewatch it cuz i was also tired as heck."
90,"The problem is not in black elves; the series is just mid. Yes, it's got cool visuals, stunning cinematography. But actors? Most of them are emotionless (especially the black dude; sorry it's just a coincidence). And the script is pretty shitty.

Call me a complainer, but this is not 1$ billion series."
91,"Man... I was actually kinda hyped for the show, is it actually that bad?

A very close friend of mine and me have loved LotR since we were young and would always chill out speculating about the movies and the books, and we were somehow optimistic for finally having a decent show, even if it has some weird outstanding decisions that don't really fit the actual lore from Tolkien's Silmarillion but whatever, we actually don't mind if things don't ""make sense"" and were expecting a fun quality show.

Please don't tell me they ruined this too."
92,"I personally enjoyed the first two episodes, and will be continuing to watch the entire series."
93,Bruh...
94,Is there a show this sub doesn’t hate? My god every week it’s a new bombardment of shitting on a show
95,"Rings of Power didn't flop

Literally who thinks it flopped? It's doing great"
96,The modern idiocrazy for tolerance = acceptance. #NoHopeForHumanity
97,"It's boring and the main character is incredibly unlikeable.

Could have been a new fantasy, but they know they'd get even less viewers.

Why pay 1 billion dollars for an IP with a loyal and die hard fanbase, then just piss them all off?"
98,"If you look the user reviews on IMDB there are only left reviews with a 6 or higher, idk if this is ""literally 1984"", but at least it's pretty sad."
99,"I swear these media companies are so busy navel-gazing at the sheer awesomeness of their creations that they forget they're making it for an audience.  Then they get pissed off when the audience rejects their works and blame the audience for sexism, racism, etc.

Just write a good story with good characters and STFU."
100,"I remember once when I was a kid, attending a meet and greet with Tolkien in nazi Berlin in '69. It was roughly at 4:20 pm (I noted this because I fainted and looked at the clock as I was falling) that Tolkien said, and I quote: ""F#ck them n@#*ers"".

Yep, Tolkien was a big old racist.

Source: trust me bro. 





Oh, yea...
