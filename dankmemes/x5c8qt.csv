1,White lives matter
2,I have a dream...
3,We all take turns being slaves in history.
4,"What would the equivalent of the N world be for white people?? ðŸ¤”  
Mean no disrespect to any one"
5,Hwip me daddy.
6,They would of done it if we didn't first
7,This wouldâ€™ve been a much better version of history
8,i think this might not be true because in 1800s there were no colorful high quality cameras and cottons are not black. my theory is that somebody took this picture in a close history
9,must be another universe
10,Almost like a premonition
11,"Seriously, it happened to all races. Move on people. Now we're all equally slaves under capitalism. Yay."
12,Isnâ€™t it cracker? Or is that specifically old crazy white people
13,There really isn't any in a society where white people don't experience that type of oppression. There are insulting terms for being white but they don't pack the same historical context that the n word does
14,Get out
15,"Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop -Â yes,Â IÂ amÂ aÂ bot, don't botcriminate me."
16,"No? Dude, you do realize that they imported slaves from Africa (maybe more), right? The people in Africa didnâ€™t have the means to make ships, travel to a (sorta) developed country and somehow manage to kidnap white people, who are heavily guarded by the military btw, and then bring the back to Africa"
17,no wonder your racist ass was downvoted
18,The cottons are white in this pic tho
19,"Yes the Pontiac Premonition. Don't forget the Oldsmobile Inkling or the Hudson Hunch. ""I got a feeling"""
20,"The world can be your prison or your playground,but the only person who can decide that is you"
21,Good bot
22,This kinda cool tho so thanks
23,ðŸ¤“
24,Omg!! A down vote!! How will ever go on with my life ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”
25,"To me it's a prison because this existence is forced and the only exit is through death. However, on the mirco, you can view it as a playground, which is a healthy way to cope."
26,"That's not capitalism though,that's life. Food and water is still required no matter what political or economic system you live under."
27,"I agree...Never said the sole reason was capitalism. This reality has the same laws for all humans, no matter where you live."
