1,"I liked when Rick said ""It's Rickin' time"" and Ricked all over the place."
2,I love that Rick n Morty fans get so upset over a game of Catan
3,"It’s not as good as lovers say, it’s not as bad a critics say, that all there is"
4,You couldn't understand most of the jokes on rick and morty unless you are very smart and superior - average rick and morty fan
5,I like Rick and Morty but it’s a bit over hyped by people.
6,"Rick and Morty is okay, but no she hulk"
7,"Come on, these days this would apply to telling anyone anything that goes against their opinions.  Fandom has devolved from a fun form of tribalism to a level of toxicity that rivals politics and religion."
8,How could it be when one piece exists ?
9,Rick and Morty fans when you tell them being a nihilist doesn’t mean you’re smart:
10,"Okay, but they have this episode with pickle Rick, funniest shit I've ever seen"
11,This is on point
12,Marvel fans *
13,Actually it's marvel fanboys after you criticizing She-Hulk
14,Rick and Marty went downhill after season3
15,Xavier Renegade Angel >>>>> Rick and Morty
16,I kinda liked the first 3 seasons
17,"Somebody’s sugar must be low…. Wait, never mind"
18,It isn't though
19,Literally every cartoon fan
20,you must not be an intellectual /s
21,The first 5 episodes where great. However couldn't keep watching a nihilistic asshole like Rick not grow as a character episode after episode. Just like bojack horsemen or the walking dead. If it's all negative tragedy then I stop caring about the characters. Things have to go right sometimes.
22,Rick and Morty fans could easily be warded off by Xavier: Renegade Angel fans.
23,"As a rick and morty fan, I second this"
24,Personally I like it but I can understand that people have  a different opinion.
25,"Pre covid meme vibes,"
26,Jojo fans when you tell them part 3 isn't a gift from god.
27,"i mean... it's not the greatest show ever made, but i think it's good and enjoy watching it"
28,Futurama is 10 times the show rick and morty is
29,It's definitely not.
30,Unironically people who aren’t Rick and Morty fans when you tell them you don’t think it’s trash tier.
31,Fuck y’all and fuck your plumbus too
32,Rick and Morty got kinda bad after season 3 tbh
33,Idk why but I never liked the show.not even a bit.
34,Undereaction to be honest
35,Honestly Rick and morty is awesome
36,"The best show it's the wire.
Have you guys heard about the wire?
Best show on tv, it's simply a master class on storytelling.
I wish more people would talk about the wire. Because that's the best show ever made."
37,Its arcane btw
38,I have a friend who forces me to watch Rick and Morty says it's better family guy  and I say family guy is better but I haven't watched Rick&Morty Noe has he watch family guy . I want someone to settle this debate who has watch both.
39,That's me I guess
40,"It is really shit, tbh"
41,Did you post this because Rick and Morty lost last night?
42,Lolololol cause they're all obese.
43,these kids have tempor issues i swear
44,It used to be better :(
45,GoT fans when you bring up season 8
46,It's not the greatest but it's such a great show.
47,Were they playing poker
48,"Its a bit over hyped like a few shows out there, but Its still okay, just some of jokes got very stale. (mostly from the internet overusing the shit out of them)"
49,"as someone that liked early R&M seasons, it never was!"
50,Gintama is better
51,Excuse me. Have you ever heard about our lord and savior Breaking Bad?
52,"The show
Is aight 
Next to she hulk"
53,"""GuYs yoU jUsT dOnt gEt iT"""
54,Show is good but not the greatest
55,"i mean, its a good show yes but the greatest show ever would need to be vor everyone not just peoples that are dumb like me and think that edgy is funny, take gravity falls for an exemple, kids can enjoy it, adults can enjoy it, this is a great show, same thin for gumball, maybe even star butterfly"
56,Okay but what is the context of this gif
57,Have you seen it 🦧
58,Breaking Bad
59,The new season starts tonight and I will not have this kind of slander
60,"Fr, it's just this awesome"
61,Don’t dis pickle Rick
62,You should see op fans
63,"It's pretty normal I also do that if you hate me

The only difference is I'm much calmer"
64,Do those people still exist? Feel like it all died down really.
65,as for the gif- I get being that mad over catan lol that game madd
66,"even you did this, still not

unless you eat the table"
67,What ever happened to that guy from the meme? I cant remember his name. I remember him losing a lot of weight and then some controversy around him and then he disappeared.
68,"It was good,now just a family drama."
69,"I mean, it’s really not lol"
70,What do you mean by that😑🤨
71,They all think they're Rick but most of them are Jerry.
72,u/savevideo
73,I watched it. I liked some of it. It is not the best show ever made.
74,Par mee see yen
75,It’s funny how now you simply can’t say you like Rick and Morty in public without everyone cringing. It’s a decent show but the fan base ruined it
76,Same reaction with Ms.Marvel and She-Hulk.
77,"You may think this is dank, but that smell is just must. 2018 called - They want their meme back."
78,u/savevideo
79,"Wait, it isn't ?"
80,It's aight. 🙀
81,"I think you mean (insert show) fans when you criticize (insert show). the last I time made fun of (insert show), (insert show)’s fans went fucking apeshit."
82,"Go fuck yourself.

And take my angry updoot too."
83,Except it literally is the best show ever made
84,Rick and Morty fan here: Arcane is the actual best show in existence.
85,"No they aren’t, shut up. I implore this sub to try to make memes that are just light hearted and funny. We don’t need to straw men people or roast shows to be funny."
86,It’s picklin’ time
87,Rick and Morby
88,"I just get annoyed that people treat it like it's somehow a show that's depth comes from it being ""scientifically complex for tv"" like the Expanse or even like Silicon valley was at times. 

R&M is literally nothing more than a parody show for mocking old overdone sci-fi tropes. It just an't that deep."
89,"perfect way to describe it. as a fan, I love/am mildy annoyed by it"
90,"i had the feeling, that fans and sceptics universally agreed that the show lost it's magic. they had a good run, but the pickle rick thing was a turning point... the hype had it's peak and it was cringy enough that many fans stopped talking about it. also, the weak/bad episodes became more frequent.
i, for example don't track release dates an missed the last season because i didn't see relevant discussion about it online or irl..."
91,"When Rick sings ""shit on the floor"" and it's actually a deep criticism of society, nobody understood it. I did. I have 163 IQ though so you know"
92,"I remember my friend telling me about rick and morty when the show went famous. He told me hey bro do you watch rick and morty? I was like no whats about,he then explained it was about adbentures in space and told me but you know, you need a high iq to get the jokes and understand the show. Till this day idk if he was joking or what cause he said that very serious..."
93,You would have to be pretty smart to understand all the jokes the first time - someone who definitely did not understand all the jokes the first time lol
94,"But that’s the genius of the writing, and why I think it is one of my top shows ever. It makes you feel smart. It’s like playing Portal, the game is actually holding your hand the whole way, but it makes you feel so good when you solve a level, or perfect a technique."
95,"To be fair, 😆😆😩😤you have to have a very high IQ 💯😏🤓😜to understand Rick and Morty. 😤😩💦❤️The humor 🤣😂👍👌is extremely subtle, 👉👌😻and without a solid grasp ✊️💪😫🍆💦of theoretical physics 👁😱😤👀most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. 😉😚😌💯👏👉👍There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, ☠️😬☠️😵which is deftly woven into his characterisation 😑🙌😼🥃- his personal philosophy 🤓😎😒😔draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, 💯😩🍑🍆💦😫for instance.

96,Or unless you have humor akin to that of a middle schooler
97,Smarter than the average Rick*
98,"Yeah, my buddy told me that it made more sense when he was high. As I was watching last season I had to take weekly breaks after each episode… that’s how fucked up that was"
99,"POV Rick and Morty fans when someone says “god bless you”

Seriously, I’ve had enough of this shit. I’m a Hindu-Buddhist and I’ve had enough of the cookie cutter arguments these fuckers give me. One time I straight up just said that juice wrld was resting easy up there and guess what happened. Please, I don’t want to bother anyone, I couldn’t care if you’re lgbt or part of another religion, just leave me alone"
100,Morbius is the surperior one for sure!!!
