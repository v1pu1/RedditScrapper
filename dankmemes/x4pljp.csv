7,YO this meme is so interrestinggg
8,What gamemode Are they playing today? Tdm?
9,"There was a rifle range in my JROTC classroom. Originally it was used for .22lr rifles, but when I was in the class it was for pellet guns."
10,That's too much fun if you ask me...

17,"You know it's funny how there's a ton of countries that dont do that and still have low gun violence rates. Truly comical, comedic even."
18,Imagine if they just couldn't get the guns even.
19,Yes
20,Never gets old apparently
21,Yes
22,America ‚òïÔ∏èüî´
23,"Ah, we have a good ol' Silverhand in our midst."
24,One main difference is the fact that the US and Mexico already have an extensive firearms black market and the criminals aren't going to give up their guns just cause everyone else did.
25,Not possible even if every citizen gave up there guns there would still be black market military weapons. Only reasonable solution is train everyone in their proper use and to be responsible.
26,Read it out loud up until the letter  c in the word decided
27,"But you act like every random person just immediately has access to the black market. That's just not the case. Same as drugs. Sure, you can just walk up to random people you assume are selling, but just doing that's likely to get you hurt more than a sale."
28,That happens with things like drugs because people get addicted. I don't think that guns are capable of replacing the positive neurotransmitters in your brain and forcing you to fire off a few bullets every day or else you'll go through withdrawal.
29,"You obviously can't think past the consequences of disarming law abiding citizens in a world where we have criminal cartels, who do have easy access to black market weapons, that won't bat an eye to exploit unarmed citizens."
30,"The black market isn‚Äôt an organized structure, let‚Äôs say Joey buys 10 pounds of tilapia from Tommy which Tommy caught illegally. Joey and Tommy have both just participated in ‚Äúthe black market.‚Äù There actually millions of black markets , even in the US where guns are legal there are black markets for guns, if we to hang all firearms those markets would just exponentially grow."
31,"Criminals don't use guns because it ""makes them feel good"" it because they can use to them to force others to do what they want by threatening them with them. You can't really be this nieve."
32,"Somehow, it works perfectly fine in many countries though. Weird how there's a near endless amount of evidence that supports gun restrictions, whilst in a country with very lax gun laws, shootings continually happen. Honestly, do you really think organised criminal cartels and such will just go around attacking people simply because they are unarmed? Absolutely ridiculous. If anything, they'll just focus on shooting each other."
33,"Well that's a false equivalence. I'm sure you realise that weapons have a significantly higher profile than most things, including drugs and such. Not to mention that it would be significantly risky for anybody to sell a weapon to somebody they don't know, meaning incredible price mark ups to make the risk more acceptable. It's not as simple as ""I cant buy them legal so I'll just walk down the street and ask for some illegal ones."" It's ridiculous to assume every random person has access to them and the ones that do, probably aren't in the mindset to just go randomly shooting people."
34,"All the evidence shows is that if criminals can't get guns they use trucks, knives, and bombs. Allowing citizens to have guns give them a greater chance at protecting themselves against those who would try to harm them."
35,"Again black markets aren‚Äôt these concentrated points like you‚Äôre thinking, in the uk for instance how most criminals get a hold of guns is because someone‚Äôs grandpa‚Äôs left them a pistol from before the ban they kept hidden and they fell on hard times and sell it under the table. Again an example of a black market. That‚Äôs because 99.999999999% of people aren‚Äôt in the mindset to just randomly go killing people. In the US right now there‚Äôs 3 or 4 types of illegal gun owners, the apathetic guy who just wants to shoot shit in the woods with a machine gun, the reformed felon who wants to protect themselves, the ignorant one who doesn‚Äôt know their gun is illegal, and the malevolent one generally an unreformed felon who owns a gun to keep doing crime."
36,"Well there's alot wrong with what you've said. For one, a gun isn't going to protect you from a bomb or even a truck to some extent anyway. For two, both bombs and guns are significantly inferior tactics for killing people in mass quantities. (Bombs are difficult to make and difficult to conceal. Trucks require a very specific situation to be considered as a weapon and it's not that difficult to prevent, literally just a concrete barrier and you're safe.) For three, give me literally one example of trucks and bombs being used as often as guns are in the US to harm people. For four, you can't protect yourself with a gun effectively. The bad guys are shooting first, always will be the case, so it's best to take away that opportunity as opposed to fighting back after the fact. Treat the disease, not the symptoms and all that. Even in an actual shoot out, you're better off just getting the hell away from the danger. You're at more risk if you stand there and shoot back."
37,So you bring a gun to a bomb fight? How well does that work?
38,"Again, I never said or meant it to be a single concentrated point. Which is exactly what makes it significantly more difficult to access. Smart people don't take risks selling weapons to people they don't know."
39,"Again like I said it‚Äôs not some rando. Most black market transactions aren‚Äôt done between two strangers usually it‚Äôs some you have a previous relationship with or somebody you are close with has a previous relationship with. It‚Äôs your cousin your neighbor, your aunt‚Äôs friends son. It‚Äôs exactly like drugs. Every weed dealer I‚Äôve ever met won‚Äôt sell to you unless they have some level of trust with you, a lot of them will even make you light up in front of them if they‚Äôre wary. Your thinking of it all wrong."
40,"Which is going to be a very limited amount of people, instead of every random psychopath who decides to go postal. I'm not sure why you would think this situation would be worse. Less deaths would occur, that is certain and that should be the main goal."
41,You mean just like banning drugs has decreased drug use?
42,Are you saying that drugs being illegal has had zero impact on deaths due to drugs?
43,"[drug deaths](https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) continue to rise and so does usage. It‚Äôs more lucrative to run drugs now than ever before thanks to big daddy government. And you seem to forget the majority of Gun owners have never even fired on another person. The majority of gun deaths are suicide, of the 45ish% that‚Äôs homicide the majority of those are from existing felons or those associated with existing felons. The amount of legal gun owners to the rate of gun homicides in America might as well be a computing error. So no banning guns will not solve the problem #1 because getting rid of any significant amount guns in America is about as realistic as trying to get rid of any significant amount of mosquitoes in Africa. #2 criminal will continue to obtain firearms illegally as they have for decades. And #3 the attempt alone run a significant chance of sparking a civil war in America, 620,000 people officially died in the first how many do you think that would be today?"
44,Drug use goes up because more people exist in poverty. Not because they are illegal. Lmfao.
45,"Really huh? did you know that after the drink age was changed to 21 in 1985 the underage drinking rate went up every year until 2005. You have no concept of reality, you‚Äôre a fool."
46,"Omg. You see a number and immediately cram it into a ""fact"" that meets your own agenda. Google yhe term ""conformation bias"". And you call me the fool. Yeah, you're totally right. Nothing should chsnge, people should just keep getting shot. Because crime??"
47,"Crime and murder will always be a thing. Look at fucking Europe, especially Eastern Europe. There‚Äôs thousands of solutions that don‚Äôt involve trying to disarm the people."
48,"Take a look at Australia. They had a mass shooting. They took away the severely dangerous guns. (Bolt action and lever action are still legal but restricted in many ways). Guess how many mass shootings have happened since then? In like 30 years? I'll give you a hint. Absolutely fuck all. But you're right, it totally doesn't work. Get a grip on reality."
49,Australians are so cucked that they banned gelsoft guns. Their government gets more authoritarian with each year and Sydney and Melbourne‚Äôs knife homicides are almost 3 times higher than New York and Chicago‚Äôs gun homicides. And now on top of all that the Australian people are now defenseless should their government betray them further.
50,"Their government is authoritarian? Are you joking? They literally just had an election and changed governments. The knife homicides committed are mostly gang on gang violence anyway, but whatever conformation bias you need to sleep at night lol. If they could get guns, they'd be using those instead and more innocent people would be getting caught in the cross fire. Defenceless against their government? Now I know you're a moron. Also, what the hell do the gel guns have to do with this argument? They're only banned in 1 state also, like, what the hell are you on about?"
51,"The majority of gun homicides are gang on gang. Why should we deprive every American of their natural rights because of the actions of a few? you can‚Äôt make the argument ‚Äúmuh mass shooters‚Äù and then acknowledge mass killings are incredibly rare. Also do you not remember all the massive protests the last couple years. How about how in Russia their conscripting their young men and forcing them to be killers. You can see tyranny in real time and still be oblivious to the fact that it can happen to any country. I brought up the gel guns to make a point of just how far government will go in disarming their people, to the point where toys are outlawed for resembling guns. [gel blasters are illegal](https://www.ldp.org.au/gelblasters#:~:text=Toys%20Aren't%20Weapons&text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the,under%20attack%20from%20new%20legislation) in all but two Australian states. You‚Äôre either a fucking idiot or a fucking liar."
52,What aboutism. Pathetic. I'm done wasting my time on your feeble mind.
