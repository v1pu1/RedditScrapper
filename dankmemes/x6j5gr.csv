1,shouldn't comment all the times ?
2,"ok. ( didn't actually comment, this can be used as some kind of silence comenting or actually not a comment . since I was going to move off sub , the ""ok"" came or would come handy as some way to provide closure to this comment thread entry in a manner in which any reader would know that it would be less than probable ( even if this doesn't really get anything to be actually be less than ""probable"" , because how can something be less than a probability since probability isn't actually a number,so really this here goes to say that it didn't actually mean something but you could extract what I mean from the feel ... ) that I'd comment at least on this very post . )"
