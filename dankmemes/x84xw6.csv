1,"Even for coyote pups, which people raise as dogs, you don't abandon. You let that mf run wild, and you do it with him"
2,Yeah i mean once they're out of their cute phase they're no use. Right ?
3,"My dog is 16 now and still going strong, granted she's blind, deaf and her brain is well and truly melted. But she still thinks she's just a puppy."
4,"What do you mean once they grow up? My pets are still babies to me, even if they're 8-10 years old"
5,Where are these folks that abandon their pets? *grabs brass knuckles*
6,That happens?!
7,My collection is the same as yours except you have that last one too
8,"Sir that's all well and good, but you still can't be running around the Walmart parking lot naked while howling at the moon"

10,"Saying this is like saying ""I mean once my child is out of their cute phase they're no use. Right ?"""
11,"Yup, read a article once about how this family dumped their dog at a pound or shelter, I forgot, cause it got ""old"" and wasn't cute anymore. Then they went back the next day to adopt a new dog. Tried to find the article but it was really old, but did find new articles about similar asshats."
12,Oh I had no idea this dog would grow into a 120 lb rottweiler. Now that I have raised it as poorly as possible I'll surrender the dog to a shelter.
13,"Trick question, kids never have a cute phase."
14,Right
15,Yess exactly thats why they have adoption center.
16,"I remember it from the news, they didnâ€™t allow the owners to adopt a new dog so they ended up adopting there old one bc the children wanted it back so much"
17,Thatâ€™s despicable
18,ðŸ’€
