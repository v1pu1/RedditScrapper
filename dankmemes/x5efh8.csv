5,Man I just wish I could get that far
6, “no plan survives first contact with the enemy”
7,When they don't go according to the script smh the attitude of some people
8,"I know this is meant to be funny, but I’ll be honest: writing the questions you wanna ask/topics you wanna discuss down isn’t a terrible idea. I’ve done that in the past and told my date that “I’m really nervous and have a terrible memory” so they wouldn’t be weirded out by the paper. Almost every time, I only got like 1-2 questions in before our conversation naturally evolved on its own, and I didn’t need the paper anymore."
9,Shit this reminds me I need to think of convo starters
10,"""wow! Great tits"""
11,Honestly that is probably a good sign that you are compatible. The pheromones are wrecking your mind.
12,This Tom & Jerry episode creeped me the fuck out as a kid
13,That's just your inner introvert strangling you.
14,She leaving the date the same way
15,"Perfect ice breaker “if you to choose between drinking a litre of saliva or eating half a pound of human hair, what would you choose?”"
16,Just write them down on a note on your phone. That way when you get to your date you can go on your phone and start scrolling through social media and forget why you went on your phone in the first place and subsequently forget about your date in the process.
17,Should have recreated the entire bar in a warehouse to get the full practice experience.
18,"I have never in my life had an issue with conversation, dating etc, because luckily it just came naturally to me.  
I also never shut up in general, so it's uncommon for me to have nothing to say. 

But I swear to god when I would talk to my ex I lost all words and thoughts. She had this effect on me and I would become such a dumbass around her.  
That feeling's some real shit."
19,"“But the cat came back, the very next day..”"
20,"As a female woman I can relate.


Yet as a male man I cannot."

34,u/savevideobot
35,"“Sorry, I had a list of interesting topics to talk about but somehow I forgot everything after meeting you, how about a drink first?”"

49,"I'm boring so I say some dumb shit like how was your day or what do you do for fun but if they give a proper response, it can lead to an actual conversation."
50,You mean the intense social anxiety
51,Do you mean hormones?
52,"Same, glad I'm not the only one. It was legitimately terrifying."
53,Man the sack of drowned kittens is seriously fucked up
54,Jokes on him.. I will do that my self
