1,"Mourning.

Sorry for your loss. Better luck next time."
2,"Inheritance tax is the biggest legal scam in the world.
People worked hard for that money to leave some behind for their kids when they pass and paid taxes their entire lives.
And when the time comes,they tax it again..."
3,"Good morning, the loss of my mother"
4,You in the US? Because if so you are getting over 5.4 million and whining about the tax bill which is 17% on the dollars over 5.4 million.

6,Thatâ€™s a weird way to spell government
7,"The thing is,as per usual this doesnt affect the rich nearly as much as it does to the average person.
But you think getting taxed twice for the same money is okay?"
8,"Dudes right, if you have enough money for the inheritance tax to apply to have no sympathy. 10 million tax free before the tax even starts to apply."
9,Based

11,"I see why there is a misunderstanding.
Where i live (belgium,europe),inheritance taxes are paid by everyone.
There are 3 different brackets depending on the amount. But the max percentage taxed is for 250k and higher. So for the super rich it doesnt change anymore."
12,"I agree the usual taxes should be higher for the rich.
But inheritance taxes fuck over the average joe more than them.
Percentage wise we pay a lot more than them,while need the money more to just live our daily lives."
13,"Ah, well my bad on my previous comment. We have a lot of dumb fucks in my country who make the exact same argument but as I pointed out above, our inheritance tax only affects the very wealthy. One of our political parties has managed to convince a concerning number of people that a small carve out on multi-millionaires and billionaires inheritance to their families is going to negatively impact people who make under $50k a year and don't even own their home."
14,"I didnt realise it was so different in the US.
If its only for the super rich then i can get behind it.
But my issue with the way it works here is this.
People work hard,get taxed on their income and get taxed at the end of the year,right?
And when they saved some money for their kids after a lifetime of work and pass away.
The government asks a tax (on money that was already taxed before) which is just crazy to me."
15,Yeah I agree it shouldn't be applied to anyone in an ordinary income/wealth range. In my country the kind of people who are subject to it already have so many loopholes and tax evasion strategies I'm inclined to root for anything that makes them pay more.
