1,"I'm fairly sure I read a writing prompt about this but with chess, and the concensus seemed to be they agreed to a draw"
2,"Wouldn't the mind reader be able to read the Seer's mind and find out what they saw, then counter it?"
3,"If we think of the standart seeing the future, They would Just see That no matter what they choose the other guy wins. It would go You check the future ,he checks you, you move. Even if there is a paradox it would go: you check,he checks...,you check, he checks, you move 

Seeing into the future That you're currently changing creates a paradox on its own witjout the mind Reader. Are you seeing the result of you seeing the future, or the future in which you didn't check the future?"
4,So this is just Edward and Alice Cullen playing chess but with rock paper scissors. It's explained in the book that pretty much the entire game happens in their heads and one of them just gives up eventually with maybe 2 pieces actually moved.
5,"You, my friend, have just stumbled upon part of one fundamental concept of computer science. 

For people interested, it’s called the “halting problem” for Turing machines

For people who don’t care that much: computers cannot predict the future because a “mind reader” (or someone who reacts to the prediction) could always counter the future it predicts (and therefore, it predicted wrong)"
6,The most epic battle.
7,"that will crash the game, enters infinite loop and eventually a segmentation fault.."
8,"They would stop trying, and talk privately about knowing each others ability."
9,Ask Task Master how his fight with Deadpool went.
10,"Read ""Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors"" manga"
11,"This is not a writing prompt, it's in the Twilight books. Edward And Alice play chess sometimes, and it's explained that pretty much the entire game happens in their heads and eventually one of them just gives up."
12,"I think the idea here is that, then the future seer would see the counter and counter that, ad infinitum."
13,"That's what I would conclude as well. However, if the seer see's the exact future (not just possibilities) then no matter what the mind reader does, the result would be the same."
14,"But then the future would change and so the mind reader’s read, and so on. The match will get soft locked, and the game will crash"
15,The right answer.
