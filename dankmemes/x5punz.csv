1,"I thought we wanted to end racism, not restart segregation."
2,"For the last time, Muslim isn‚Äôt a race nor ethnicity lmao"
3,I had completely forgotten that pewdiepie existed
4,Black people spend a century trying to desegregate schools only for their children to try and undo it.
5,"Only a matter of time until someone unironically says ""separate but equal"" on that line of thought"
6,What about the Asian kids or are we just picking and choosing the disadvantaged minorities now
7,"Ah, segregation, the only way of stoping racism. You can't be racist if other races are not around amirite?"
8,"People don't think anymore. This isn't an opinion, it's a fact. They just forgot how to connect multiple thoughts together and come up with a reasonable solution"
9,Segregation go brrrrr
10,They probably fell asleep in class during the lesson on segregation.
11,I think we already tried that...
12,"Mmyes my favorite race, Muslim."
13,People think human history is a line when in reality it's a circle.
14,People becoming so woke they want to bring back segregation. What a weird world we live in.

There are at least 3 issues with her understanding of either, maybe 4"
18,People think by being racist to white people they're helping to end racism
19,Hahahaha imagine your ancestors working tirelessly to break segregation for your grandchild to bring it back willingly. This generation from twitter is a new kind of stupid
20,"Discriminating someone based on a skin collor.....  
Isn't that a definition of racism?"
21,This sounds like segregation ~~With extra steps~~
22,"The problem with ""separate but equal"" thinking is that reality never plays out like that. *In theory,* you could have separated schools without inequality between them, but in reality, that just doesn't happen."
23,We had that and The National Guard was called in to change that at gunpoint‚Ä¶
24,ENGLISH MOTHER FUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT?
25,"You hear that?

That's MLK rolling in his grave"
26,Muslim is my new favourite race now
27,"Where are you gonna put all the white kids? In a white only school?

Wait a minute‚Ä¶"
28,"I've suffered more racism than some of these ""colored"" people and I look white.  
Bunch a fucking cry babies that are just as racist as the ones who treated me wrongly.  
Segregating anyone only because of their ethnic background is racist, and anyone who says you can't be racist against white or any other race is a racist themselves.   
Disgusting, I hope people like her never reproduce, but sadly they will, dumb people tend to have more children than the smart ones and that's just a fact."

37,"Black people in the 60s: We need to end segregation!

*Government passed The Civil Rights Act of 1964*

Black people in the 60s: Bruh"

41,White Spaniards and white Muslims playing on easy mode
42,Hey mate can I borrow your Muslim colored pencil real quick?
43,I fucking hate American woke cultures way of treating all people with darker skin like they are one big group. Even right here you can see she is so ignorant she put ‚ÄúIndians/Muslims‚Äù as if that is one category

53,"""One who doesn't learn from history is bound to repeat it"" or smth like that."
54,"This could be seen in 2 different ways and both are bad. Going back to the old days when whites were seen at better than the rest, or now it‚Äôs just racism towards white people cause according to this person all they do is cause problems."
55,Holy shit I did not know anybody was capable of coming up with such a bad idea
56,"No R2, we need to be going up, not down!"
57,Funny how people think racism only exists between white and etc‚Ä¶ goes to show how little they know of the world.
58,"Oh yeah, the Muslim race.

Dumbass bitch."
59,White girl confirms that there are no ‚Äúnon-coloured‚Äù muslims
60,She's campaigning for segregation?
61,As well racist it‚Äôs incorrect. Muslims aren‚Äôt a race
62,The funniest thing about this to me is that those races don‚Äôt get along well with or without the whites involved.
63,Welcome to the 50s kids
64,We tried that a while ago and the results were pretty bad
65,sEpArAtE bUt eQuAl
66,Isn't that just racism
67,We did that and it didn‚Äôt work üòê

82,andddd this is what happens when you don‚Äôt pay attention in your history classes at school.
83,Omg we need a system that bans dumb people from the internetü¶ß
84,The fact that she slipped Muslim in there...
85,I love the color Muslim.
86,So where do white Muslims like me go?
87,Tiktok moment
88,so you mean bring back white-only schools? smart ‚Ä¶
89,"Some schools actually have started to self segregate, people send their kids to schools with people who have similar cultural values."
90,We are evolving back to the 1900s
91,I thought prison already existed...
92,"""well thats just racism with extra steps"""
93,Muslim isn‚Äôt a race‚Ä¶
94,Muslim? So a white Muslim bosniak is considered poc?
95,"As a Muslim, I disagree"
96,Wouldn't that be devolving?
97,"We used to have that. We also used to do it with water fountains, among other things. 

Do people just not get taught this anymore?"
98, remember that time when that evergreen college in Washington had a ‚Äúno whites‚Äù day? Then held their principle hostage.
