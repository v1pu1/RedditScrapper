8,I remember seeing a video about this. It even went as far as explaining how even our languages evolve and we forget certain symbols and stuff. They went to explain how our fors of communication and understanding of sounds may differ from an alien. They may not be able to hear our sounds and vice versa. Our sounds of peace and tranquility may fear and death to them. Who's to say for sure ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9,"We can't hear most of the stuff we send out we use instruments to code or decode the information. If they are advanced enough to find the transmission chances are they will be able to figure out how to listen to it. The understanding it part is a little more complex and that's why we usually try to use the Rosetta stone method of sending these messages in more than one script and sometimes using symbology to try to represent the data with more universally understood things.


The biggest part of your question can be distilled into ""do others experience consciousness in the same way I do?"" And the answer is we don't even know if humans experience consciousness in the same way. We have no idea if what I see as blue you see as my yellow, but you've just been trained to treat yellow with all the same qualities as I have been trained with blue. That being said it took a couple billion years for us to evolve all the weird sensory crap we use and look how many crabs happened along the way. Chances are the aliens are crabs I guess is what I'm trying to say."
