10,"Regarding that the Fog World and Otherworld are localized to the city of Silent Hill, or in some cases to people who have a connection with the city, I'd be pretty well off, considering I live in Europe.

In the ReVerse you are constantly under threat of a bio-terrorism attack in any part of the world. If we're talking games, I might have a chance by being lucky. If it is movie universe, well, we're all fucked.

If, by world, you mean the setting of the games, however, well... I've got deep psychological trauma, so SH is gonna fuck me sideways, but if I survive I might get out with a deeper understanding of my own psyche. In Raccoon City, I'll just be bombed at the end, if I survive at all.

Either way, Lisa Garland, I'm coming, baby!"

16,No its a hellish place where the person who does some weird ritual can make it to whatever he or she wants it to be. Basically manifest their evilness into the physical world which is why there's weird monsters. Also the world can be altered at any moment in Silent Hill like one second there's a door the next it's disappeared and the walls have turned into bloody flesh or grows eyes and a mouth. The player is just stuck in there and has no control over these changes unless they stop the person who's doing them.  [ This is a short game trailer for Silent Hill 4 for example. This particular hellish world was made by a serial killer named Walter Sullivan who did a weird ritual thing and changed everything. You play as Henry a person who just lived in Silent Hill and realized he's now trapped inside his apartment and must find a way out while facing these monsters. It was not Henry's personal hell it was Walter's the Serial Killer. ](https://youtu.be/GW_is7yL6_U)
