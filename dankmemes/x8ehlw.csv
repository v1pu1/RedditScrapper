1,"I‚Äôm fucking tired of this shit. It‚Äôs the same cycle *every single time*.

>‚ÄúNo you can‚Äôt form any opinion on [media] from the teaser. No you can‚Äôt think negatively of the [media] from the trailers it‚Äôs too soon! No you can‚Äôt dislike the [media] after watching several hours of it the story isn‚Äôt done yet! No wait you can‚Äôt not want to watch [media] because there‚Äôs another season and it‚Äôs only gonna get better and more fleshed out! Stop being such a bigot and consume all of the [media] and it‚Äôs supplementary comics, books, behind the scenes, and director‚Äôs commentary before forming an opinion!!!‚Äù"
2,"Is the show as bad as some say? No, of course not. Is the show good? No as well."
3,"25% of anything is a sizable chunk. No one is obligated to consume 100% of anything to form a valid opinion of it. Can I not say I hate bagels if I only have a bite and it makes me gag? Equally can I not say that I love corn after only a bite? 

I don‚Äôt hate the show. It‚Äôs not summer heat garbage tier but I also don‚Äôt love it so far."
4,""" You can't judge the show from the trailers""

"" Two episodes? That's not enough ""

"" Just wait for season 2 it gets better. ""


Yeah no. Show is ass."
5,To answer the title: Yes.
6,This is might be  the stupidest opinion ever
7,"Dawg I watched the first 30 mins and there was so much wrong with it in such a short time span. I value my time, not gonna voluntarily waste it further on something bad"
8,"If 25% of anything is shit, it's shit. Something is good not for having good moments, but by being consistently good."
9,"I watched having not seen lord of the rings (shamefully) for near on a year, and yea no it's not fun, I wasn't going in expecting it to be as good as LOTR, but I at least expected some good stuff, I can't find anything positive to say about it, it's not even the writers fault, it's the fact everything these days needs to follow a formula to be more inclusive, LOTR is a magical world, I don't need to know about diversity or anything, I just want to see cool magic shit, with cool fight scenes and amazing lore. That's why I loved the original series (gonna go off on a tangent here, sorry in advance) I don't care whether someone's gay, I don't care about their personal lives, I just want to learn enough about them so I can find them relatable, nothing else."
10,"I seens it before i tells you hwat.  Just like the Halo show, I knew it was bollocks from the get go, but i just had to he certain.  So i kept watching, and the tomfoolery just would not stop I tells yeh."
11,I haven't even seen a trailer or episode and I already know it's gonn be shit
12,I don't need to see the entire turd to know it's shit
13,"I‚Äôve been enjoying it. I‚Äôm not a hardcore lotr fan though, only seen the films and the hobbit films once"
14,What? I guess I‚Äôm alone in really enjoying the show!
15,Ringo Power purists on their way to shit on a show after seeing 1 of the actors melanin levels
16,I‚Äôve never watched lord of the rings but decided to watch rings of power and I‚Äôve been enjoying it so far
17,I'm personally hesitant to watch it because I've always been a Tolkein fanboy and from what I know of the show it goes against a lot of what he wanted for the franchise and even changes some of the world building (which I just don't get because I feel like most people can agree that LoTR has some of the best world building out there)
18,i havent seen the show but that is some flawed logic if a show doesnt have you hooked by the second episode then its ok to say you dont like it. its fine if you do but a show is a huge time commitment compared to a movie so its fair for them to judge 2 hours worth of a show which is generally equal to the length of a movie
19,What‚Äôs wrong with them wanting to hate a little. If their having fun hating and other people are having fun arguing with them about hating then that‚Äôs all that matters. Everyone who doesn‚Äôt like it can just ignore it and go about their lives.
20,"You... absolutely can judge a movie after seeing 25% of it. Sometimes things turn around, or are slow burn, but othertimes you can just *know* they're gonna suck 10 mins in."
21,On their way to said that the show sucks based on a 30 second clip.
22,"Feels familiar....

Maybe because She-Hulk had the exact same thing"
23,"That‚Äôs all you need to know they completely disregarded the lore üòÇ

When she jumped in the sea was cringe af"
24,"I agree with most of the honest reviews, they nailed it for integration of black actors. The story is .. great but still early to really say. The graphic design is nice, different from Jackson but accurate enough. You should watch, at least the first 2 -4 episodes"
25,"Yeah, it's somewhere in between. But I hope it will get better"
26,"Two reasonable arguments followed by a fictitious one that no one has ever used for this‚Ä¶

Good job buddy"
27,Why exactly is it ass?
28,"To be fair, the first two episodes could definitely lead up to a great series. It will definitely not be as good as the original trilogy, but I don't think anyone really expected this anyway. It could be on the level of game of thrones though and as long as it's better than the hobbit it's fine imo."
29,The problem isnt even oh black people nobody has a problem with it if anything she was one of the best written characters in the series. Its just that the show is dogshit and golden shit is still shit
30,"Not by having a few good moments, but by being consistently good."
31,"The thing is, the first two episodes are not shit. They are by no means on the level of the original LOTR trilogy, but could definitely be the start of a great series. They could lead to a series of the niveau of game of thrones or even better.

The problem is that everyone has/had too high expectations. It was absolutely obvious that it wouldn't become as good as the original films."
32,no it's gud
33,"I like it. But then again, I tend not to fuss with political BS when I watch shows. I'm there for the story, as long as the actor's are portraying it well enough for me to get into the story, I'll probably enjoy it, regardless of if there are ""supposed"" to be black dwarves or what not.

When my kid watches a show, he isn't hung up on why one or two characters don't match the original lore of bla bla bla. Why should I? I'm here to be entertained, I come in with that frame of mind instead of the frame of mind that I have to not enjoy something just because a bunch of dorks are mad at one actor's skin color not lining up with lore.

What a weird and sad hill to choose to die on when there are way better, more important hills."
34,Poor guy is getting downvoted for having an opinion
35,"If you're enjoying it, great.

I tried.  The dialog is bad and the characters are bland so I can't bring myself to watch any more of it."
36,How dare you?
37,"The problem is that people are Review bombing a show that's not really bad. This way they might stop people who originally wanted to see it from actually watching it and denying those who enjoyed it a second season.

If you don't like it and write a bad review, that's fine. But if don't give it a chance from the beginning, you shouldn't be surprised that you can't enjoy it, it's a self fulfilling prophecy."
38,Agreed. Had very high hopes for this. Slightly disappointed.
39,"The outcome is inevitable.  People WILL defend the show by the end of the season praising season 2 will be better.  Don't be naive.

Then the cycle will continue. You won't be able to criticize the trailers and you won't be allowed to review it for the first few √©pisodes."
40,"Bad writing.  The ""tell rather than show"" is gratting.  Would have been better without LOTR tagged to it. Expectations are high and they can't deliver.


Edit : small typo. Without LOTR."
41,Bingo!!
42,Bad reviews are just another form of marketing called ‚Äúnegative marketing‚Äù half of them are actually paid for by amazon to drum up interest in the show. Some people will say they will never see the show because of it. However the discourse will reach a much larger audience than traditional ad campaigns and entice the people who could care less about the arguments into checking it out. Don‚Äôt worry about Amazon they know what their doing and these ‚Äúbad‚Äù reviews are actually helping them get more audience not less.
43,The problem is that everything is shit when compared to the LOTR trilogy. It's not their fault
44,I doubt they are coming from Amazon. Amazon blocked reviews for three days to counter review bombing after all.
45,Its definitely their fault i think none expected this show to be on the same level or better than lord of the rings but everyone atleast expected to be good cuz its from lotr they didnt need to beat lotr to make it good they just had to make it good
46,How can it not be their fault ? What. They spent √† billion on it .
47,Even if it‚Äôs not paid for by them it would still fall in the ‚Äúhype‚Äù category and have a similar effect. I was planning on watching it but was weary of it. Hearing the bad reviews about how far away it is from the original books actually helped me enjoy the show more because my expectations were lowered to consider it more of a very expensive fan fiction.
