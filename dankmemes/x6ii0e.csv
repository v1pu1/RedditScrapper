1,"If your girl tells you its the perfect size, it means 2 things.
1. She really loves you.
2. It's small."
2,"According to surveys, the average length preferred by women is about 6.4”. [[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558040/)]

The global average that men actually have is 5.3”. [[Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/average-penis-size)]"
3,How does she know big ones hurt🤨
4,"Lot of people here implying women say that just to make you feel better. A lot of women actually dont like then bigger because it hits their cervix and it hurts. I have had to back off in certain positions with my wife because it hurts her. Any toys we get can't be very big because bigger hurts her. I've had other partners it's the same. Just because she says this doesn't mean it's not true. Some women can just take a big one and it feels good. Others can't and an average size is actually the best feeling. 

Also, many women can only orgasm with clit stimulation. So even though the dick may not be S class, if that tongue and finger game on point you good."
5,Just tryna make you feel better bro...
6,"That is literally every woman.

If big dicks were optimal for fucking then they'd get bigger with each generation."
7,She loves my ego
8,This is why women hate me
9,You heard that little guy!
10,At least if it’s not a choking hazard.
11,Big ones hurt??
12,"This means two things :

One- she really likes you

Two - it's small"
13,Copium
14,u/savevideo
15,"When she comes at u grab ur dick, name it and she says she love it, then you can feel somewhat reassured about it, if it is not the case then i would say she os not the one"
16,To be fair… they do
17,my mum always said this when i was little
18,Watcha gonna do then?
19,So she is taking big ones too? Or is that past experience...
20,"""That means 2 things though
1. She likes you
2. It's small"" - Nordern; bald, funny, Norwegian, War Thunder gamer"
21,How does she know?? 🤫🤫🤫
22,This means that she had big before in her 🌚
23,I have won but at what cost?
24,Long ones are great. Sadly my ex took his when he broke it off.
25,Maybe only 2.
26,"Dear sir, what was the sample size for this survey"
27,6.4? It is time to chop
28,Sounds like some serious cope
29,More women should not judge size because 5 inch is the average the women who judge should learn to accept a man's dick either small and big
30,Previous experiences?
31,Toy
32,This guy fucks!
33,Sir you must spill the deets on ur size
34,Nah big ones hurt dude
35,"If you say it we have conformation that you think its small, just shut up about dick size and if you want to make men feel better just moan mor passionatly"
36,They literally have. Humans literally have one of the highest mass to penis size ratio out of any mammal. They have gotten bigger over the generations. Just because they aren’t all 10 inches long now doesn’t mean they haven’t.
37,Yup

39,"I can’t remember, I saw it on TV a long time ago."
40,"Okay, I just checked Google to back up my claim and I guess the results I have seen on TV are either outdated or false.

Multiple sources online claim the average preferred length by women is 6.4”.

Except for the “New York Post”, which states that 8” is the preferred length.


I will edit my original comment accordingly, I apologize for the confusion."
41,Also location
42,precisely! she got banged by a man with a bigger dong than you!
43,"I'm just average, man. I got a six shooter. It has never let me down though. I was insecure about it when I was younger cuz I thought you had to have the big dick. I'm sure there are women out there it wouldn't be enough for, and that's perfectly ok cuz they know what they like. When I realized sex wasn't just about penetration, it freed me from that insecurity, as well as allowed me to be more than just a one trick pony. Now my foreplay, kink, and head game is polished."
44,So then on behalf of the other male Redditors here. How big is too big?
45,"I mean this is Reddit, what'd you expect? Also I'm a dude so- just memeing. I couldn't care less. Not like I'm getting unvirgined any time soon. If ever"
46,"Go to your grandpa and ask if he has a 2.5 incher.

Yeah we got bigger brains in the past but that doesn't mean they'll keep growing. We've reached the maximum size. Any bigger would and it would be nearly impossible to give birth because the baby's head would be too big."
47,Objective science. Nobody lied.
48,EIGHT INCHES? That's porn-star dick wtf.
49,No way who the fuck wrote it lol
50,lol at the Post. As if conservative chuds needed MORE things to feel insecure about.
51,Typical sensational tabloid crap by New York Post
52,"Could i dm you? I wanna know how to overcome that insecurity too, although I'm at a larger size"
53,"I can say my preference but of course it'll be different for everyone, so keep that in mind. My perfect might be another person's too small or too big.

For me, I have to tap out at like six to six and a half inches. And I can only take that much if I'm aroused. My preference would be 5 and a half, just enough to feel full but not painful. I haven't had a problem with too small yet, but if I had to guess I'd say four or less would be *difficult* to work with, not necessarily non-pleasurable.

Having said that, I haven't met my size limit for the back entrance yet. I usually direct a gentleman round that way if he's packin serious heat."
54,"Technically same here but my god i have one tip for you,
Get. Your . Ugly. Ass . Out. There 

The best tip you will ever receive in terms of dating"
55,"
>Go to your grandpa and ask if he has a 2.5 incher.

That's not... how any of this works"
56,"My grandpa doesn’t have a 2.5 inches, but my 500x great grandpa most likely does. Also the reason that human brains aren’t growing anymore is because we no longer live in a society where being a bit less genetically gifted increases ur chances of dying by a massive amount. 

Just like penises, brains were growing too. Unless u think that since my grandpa has an approximately equal size brain, so do my monkey ancestors? Evolution does not happen that quickly. It happened, but slowly over the generations, hence why u have to look at monkeys to notice the difference and not ur grandpa. Also, just like with brains, penises won’t be growing as much due to monogamy, causing more people to be likely to reproduce, instead of a minority of men impregnating the majority of women."
57,"I think they actually measured them for that.

This means ""penis inspector"" is a real job."
58,I have since updated and edited my comment with more trustworthy sources. I apologize for the original mess-up though.
59,Gotta sell more F150s
60,Sure
61,Oh my. But you know what no. Fair play. Respect for actually saying this to a Reddit comment section
62,Ayo what I actually have a chance?!?
63,I mean. Despite all my mental health issues I have been going out a lot since I met a new friend. This week alone I'm going out to a party with a group of friends so there's that. Have a few other small things going on but not much. But I am meeting new people and friends and meeting new groups of people. Shits good... Despite that. I ain't got no bitches
64,"You sound very insecure, self projection much?"
65,"But if a minority of men impregnate a majority of women, that would cause a bunch of people in the next generation to have the same dad which would lead to incest. A diverse genepool allows the species as a collective to survive."
66,"And here I've been doing it for free all these years, I could've retired by now..."
67,Sample size of 75…that’s incredibly small (heh get it? Small? No…? Ok i will leave)
68,Was that TMI? Lmao sorry I was just trying to be honest for those curious
69,Depends. What's your dick situation looking like lol
70,"Give it time, with you out there as long as you aren't a dick head/incel, you will find someone. Bitches are hard to get, make friends first then work your way into a relationship."
71,"Man u really don’t know how society was back in the day and it shows. I’ll give u a quick example. Theoretically, I should have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents,  and approximately 4 trillion 40x great grandparents. 1000 years ago, was the population 4 trillion or greater? There was a lot of incest back in the day."
72,No that was extremely validating for a lot of guys who read it. Don’t worry.
73,No no I'm just surprised is all lol. Most women aren't really open about it I don't think. At least to Reddit. But hey I also don't talk to women irl so I wouldn't know lol... But the info is good to know as a general ballpark cause I've known women online who claim that 7 inches is still not enough and I'm like X to Doubt kinda thing.
74,You're not wrong but I recently got out of a 4.5 year ldr that wasn't the best... There's only one woman that I'd be interested in a relationship with rn but otherwise I don't really care. So ig I'm just going out for fun at this point
75,"Do you are have stupid? People have siblings. Just not so many that they won't have options outside of fucking them. Every person doesn't need their own distinct parents, humans can multiply. Just not in this polygamous, sexual hierarchy way."
76,=(
77,"I mean, for some that's true. But they have larger than average vaginas. Humiliation and big dick stuff is also just a fetish, so they could be playing into that for themselves or whoever else is into it. But body shaming is body shaming; IMO they should keep that roleplay stuff in dedicated subs so everyone can consent to that kind of degradation."
78,Yeah... Tbf social media and shit always makes me doubt myself but ik I'm fine even if people won't believe me especially online lol... But at the same time idk. Shits fucked yo. Not like it's gonna matter cause virgin for life yo!
79,Now im wondering what counts as a massive Vagina lol
80,"Fuck social media. You just need to find the right girl. Unless you wanna be virgin for life, in which case more power to you!"
81,I believe we have just found the most based woman on reddit.
82,"I don't want to be a virgin for life but I've honestly given up hope and also care. I just don't care anymore. If it happens great, if not, I'm not surprised. 

Only one girl I wanna be with but she don't want me back. Which is my life story in a nutshell. Always so close yet so damn far"
83,"Like I said, you just haven't found the right one yet. If she's not into you, she's not right for you. I know that hurts like hell to hear, but trust me it'll get better"
84,I really do appreciate those words but in terms of sex and relationships I've just given up. I don't care anymore. I've got shit to do and my career and dreams to follow. Everything else is just a distraction and a waste of time and effort. So if it happens it happens if not then not. I simply honest to God don't care anymore
85,"I respect that. I'm not saying you have to actively search, I'm just reminding you not to ignore the obvious should it come your way. You never know. In the meantime, keep rocking and improving yourself, cause you come first with or without a partner"
86,Amen to that. Thanks. And I'll keep your words in mind :)
