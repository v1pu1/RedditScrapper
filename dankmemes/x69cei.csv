Cool, you're a repeater node on the signal path of vaguely-funny memes. It's like playing Beatles covers on open mic night, except that would require you to have actually learned a skill and put in any effort at all. But even then people might go ""yeah cool"" and never really aknowledge that you exist. You want to be seen? Make your own shit."
