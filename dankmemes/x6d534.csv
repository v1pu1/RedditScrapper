1,Popular kids: Keep my table out yer motha fuckin mouth!
2,we welcome u brother
3,I need to give Brendan Fraser a hug
4,"As an old nerdy guy for any youngns reading this.

The popular kids that act like jackasses usually have horrible home lives, and are honestly very boring people.

They might look popular now, but unless they are heirs of multimillionaire families, life is going to slap them with the force of 30 irradiated will smiths.

Seen this dozens of times, I don't even consider myself ""seccessful"" by far, but my life is still far better compared to what the popular kids have been doing.

Don't hate on them, just ignore them and live life as best as you can, at least the ""steriotypical"" nerdy people playing DnD in the corner have actual friends to play with."
5,"I was too weird to be popular and high school was brutal because of it. But in college, I met a group of people who were too weird to be popular just like me.

And thirty plus years later, I am still friends with most of those weirdos. Once you find your tribe, popular just doesn’t matter."
6,as a man a love this man
7,"Popular kids don't do that, that's why they're popular"
8,Will Smith and Jada Smith have now become more annoying than the Kardashians
9,Aw hell no.  I glared at them for their past transgressions as well as the current one of thinking I'm desperate enough for friends that I'd allow my abusers to dine with me.  Approach me apologetically in a situation in which you have nothing to gain; THEN we'll discuss acceptance.
10,All hail the underdogs!
11,I'm just glad Brendan Fraser Is he getting any attention he deserves.
12,Is this for like generic 90's drama movies
13,Imagine actually having clicks set in stone in school
14,"Damn, this hit me right in the 2004 high school memories"
15,Brendan Fraser deserves to be praised
16,Did he sleep in that suit?
17,"/) \*Ahem\* As an American, I feel it is my patriotic duty to say ""The next day, none of the rejects showed up to school."""
18,Yeah when a new kid with 8 pack abs sits near em they couldnt do that (i actually have 6 because my dad sends me to basketball courses)
19,"Is there such a differentiation of people by popularitys in your schools?
I have never experienced something like that, that's why I wonder"
20,He eating the table or something?
21,"As someone who plays D&D, I gotta say I’ve met some of the my closest friends and strengthened the bond between existing friends through D&D, I definitely prefer it to “looking cool” to everyone else"
22,"I get called a nerd by some dicks in school for playing DnD, my favourite response is just ""thanks"".
It just stumps them and I really don't take offence in being called a nerd"
23,My g here
24,Same
25,"Yeah it's more of a cliques with people bouncing between 2 or 3 circles. Personally with some bias, my school's A-holes we're the theater kids, and the nicest group were the football nerds who went to practice and got home at dusk to play Titanfall."
26,"Eh, maybe in some circumstances, but there's definitely a sort of good chain in highschools that can be a bit aggressive as those who are on the top are kinda rude to assert dominance. Very mean girls-esk"
27,"I disagree from my stint of not being very old I can conclude that kids are cunts and that, maybe to you but not to a lot of people, the popular kids fit this description better than most. The nicest people I ever met werent in the pop group."
28,"Fuck off, plenty of people were popular at school because they were a sociopath or friends with one. I can personally confirm it because I was one of the latter."
29,You’ve gotta taste the table to make sure it’s the right one.
30,"DnD/Tabletop RPGs are awesome tools to making friends. =D  


I'm not even introverted but I moved cities recently, and I've been in the ""how the hell do I make friends after college?"" phase. My solution was just offering to DM on a local whatsapp group. I've made about 3 friends in a matter of a couple of months doing this."
31,"It's been a long time since I was at school. But if I got back in time I would probably just bully back, laugh and mock people for not having friends to play.

I dunno, I did it twice in highschool and it sort of worked. A dude asked me if I was into ""dwarves"" because I talked a lot about builds with my friends and he must have heard it.  


I just laughed at him because ""no, are you? eww why are you sharing your kinks with me dude? I know you LOOK like the kind of coomer but boundaries my guy..."".  


His friends laughed at him and I never had problems with the guy again... buuut I don't know if it would work with most people."
32,The nerdy athletes were always the nicest IMO because they had the widest range in perspective
33,"That's cool, but like actually cool"
34,"Me, a nerdy theater kid: I’m playing both sides so I always come out on top"
35,"Kids are cunts and by no means angles but you will never become popular with most people if you're an asshole to everyone. That obviously doesn't stop popular kids from being assholes to specific people, but not in general."
36,"Most athletes were like this when I was in highschool (some time before titan fall, but then it was dragon ball Z or SOCOM or Halo or whatever thing marketed at boys piqued their interest.


The story of unfriendly, insecure theatre nerds also checks out."
37,"Being in highschool myself and not being very popular at all I can tell you that somepeople are just dickheads for the sake of being dickhead. Being ugly myslef there are 5 people I have ever met, bar my parents, that have not judged me on that. Those 5 are the people I would trust with my life and everything I own"
38,"Yep, also the nerds who didn't do any extracurriculars at all. I remember them always being shocked that a ""jock"" like me dressed up as Phantom Menace Anakin for Halloween one year or loved Tolkien."
39,"Bullies exist everywhere, in every clique and every group. They just have different targets and bully methods"
