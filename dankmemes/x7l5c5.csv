0,"imo, because of that and because Hailee Steinfeld was much more likeable in hawkeye than Tatiana Maslany in she hulk."
1,"Cuz in Hawkeye they didn't have a female protagonist whose whole personality was ""Ooo I'm a woman! WORSHIP ME!!!"""
2,I was more upset when they replaced Edward Norton.
3,"While I agree we don't need to turn every super hero into a female (people on the internet can be very toxic),I don't mind She-Hulk because she was already a comic book character in the first place. What I don't like is She-Hulk's character. She's just very self-centered, and says to Bruce: ""oh, you're life is easier. I have it harder because I'm a woman. I get cat-called and hit on, which is worse than what you go through. I control my anger easily, because if I don't, I get called whiney and snobby and all that"". 

And I'm just like: ""shut the f up. You don't know half of what Bruce Banner had to go through""

It's characters like her who are so annoying"
4,"Plenty of fans are also mad because they actually like She-Hulk (the real one, from the comics)."
5,Hawkeye slander will not be tolerated.
6,Mark Rufallo is not as good as Ed Norton... Change my mind.
7,I’ve always thought hawkeye was a useless weak link.
8,Just don’t watch the sitcom if you don’t like it. Its existence isn’t harming you in any way.
9,Hawkwho?
10,Because the female is likeable
11,"I would say it’s because people actually like Kate Bishop, and she was well written, then again I know not everyone thinks the same and also I haven’t actually seen she hulk so"
12,">""Ooo I'm a woman! WORSHIP ME!!!""

Kate Bishop is to Hawkeye what Tim Drake was to Batman, in the best way"
13,">And I'm just like: ""shut the f up. You don't half of what Bruce Banner had to go through""

What makes it worse is that she knew what bruce had gone through, she just didn't care. For her getting catcalled is worse than having yourself hunted by military all around the world or having no control over your body."
14,I like deadpool. He’s a cool guy (:
15,"Oh my God, you're right. She just doesn't care. As harsh as it might sound, I would love to see her go through EVERYTHING Bruce Banner had to go through, even fight with Thanos, then see if she'd prefer to get catcalled or told how to do her job"
