2,Edible indeed
3,We know some normal and fighting type pokemon moves
4,Ah yes MatPat
5,"Humans can use splash, tackle, scratch and many more normal type moves"
6,ayo
7,"you mean ""punch"" and ""slap""?

I don't think that there have been any instances of humans using them in the anime.

also for some reason pokemon seem to be reproducing exclusively through eggs (although many of them look like mamals) and human eggs have never appeared in the anime."

9,Never appeared in the anime doesnt mean not-canon. It just means that it hasn't been shown.
