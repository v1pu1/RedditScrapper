0,"Scratch your balls. Eyes are usually drawn to movement so ""catch her"" looking at your genitals and call it a tie."
1,"Don't worry guys, even other women look at boobs."
2,Honestly I never intend to like sometimes just land there by accident
3,"Of course they know, I lick my lips and moan"
4,So I get to watch her chest + a woman looking at me? I see this as an absolute win
5,"Of course they know.

Boobs are like the sun, don't stare. Glance quick, get an idea of it, then keep eyes away."
6,Do they know that we spend exponentially more time trying not to look than we do actually looking at them? It‚Äôs hard work that we never get credit for
7,I also notice when I get checked out. It's not a gender thing It's a public awareness thing.
8,"She's welcome to look at mine as well, probably bigger than hers."
9,"Weirdly enough, this is the fourth ""women know when you look"" meme I've seen in the last hour."
10,"Man, i do understand this, but women also gotta realize its not always on purpose.

Sometimes i just be lookin around and my eyes swing past em, sometimes im just starin off into space thinkin about shit and people happen to be in front of me. I also sometimes accidentally make eye contact with people when im walkin down the street, its awkward, but it happens. I know im one ugly mf and you dont want me lookin atcha, but im not always payin attention to where im lookin.

Im not intending to do it, but it happens sometimes when you're like me and dont look at your phone 24/7."
11,"It‚Äôs because of ‚Äúboob time‚Äù. If you look a boobs for 1/2 second, it‚Äôs about 5 seconds in boob time."
12,"Wasn't there a study that says it's healthy for a man to look, the stress of not looking is bad for your health. Something along those lines."
13,"Ah yes, the ""Boob Time"" thing"
14,"There is a problem with this statement. They know only for the ones they've noticed. They think they get 100% of the stares, but what if they didn't notice one? They wouldn't know. They still think they see 100% of the stares, but they are wrong."
15,"And they ""know"" even if you didn't, so yeah..."
16,What if I wear sunglasses
17,I have eye contact problems so I am usually looking down when talking to someone. Sometimes during conversation I realize I‚Äôve been staring directly at a man‚Äôs crotch while trying to make a sentence.
18,"I have a wife and she has *magnificent* tits, and many low-cut shirts. 

I can stare all I want, and I do ;)"
19,"Imma start walking around with a cutout panel in my shorts so the base of my shaft is showing, then I'll get all angry at the women.

*\*AHEM\*  Ladies, my eyes are UP HERE!*"
20,Humans regardless of their gender or sexual preferences are all subconsciously magnetised to looking at bulges.
21,I‚Äôve been accused of this when i definitely wasn‚Äôt. Bit of a broken clock phenomenon
22,there's a reason Morphius is wearing sunglasses
23,I never do it on purpose tho.
24,Oh no ! Anyway...
25,This meme would‚Äôve been perfect if you edited a pair of tits in the reflection of his glasses.

27,Like I care ü§£
28,Oh fuck
29,"Weird, I've never been confronted about it."
30,peek?a true man stares
31,I know they know because my eyes become giant
32,Shit‚Ä¶
33,I was shocked when I found out
34,"Honestly, I don't even mean to do it either. Sometimes I be just taking in my surrounding and accidentally glance at some."
35,That‚Äôs cap
36,What if I told you that I don‚Äôt care
37,Women do it too.

39,"Why does this keep getting posted today? Is this some grand revelation people are having suddenly?

They've always known that people look, even women tend to take glances at other women.

Men also tend to take glances at other men. (Not that you could get them to admit it, but there have been studies on it)

Women also take glances at men.

This is all natural. It's when ur a creeper that it's problematic."
40,"Do people not realize eyes wander? Like sorry, if I want to look down I have to move my eyes to the left or right first then back oh pls.

No offense, if a woman is so insecure and looking for that kind of thing, then she needs a reality check. Just cause we look doesn't mean we stare get over yourselves."
41,"I intuitively smack lips and get an erection, so pretty sure they know"
42,"What if I told you, I know they know? 

And quick peek isn‚Äôt equivalent to staring. Some guys are fucking creeps and wonder why they can‚Äôt get any respect haha"
43,What if I told you.. I catch woman looking at my crotch when I wear gym shorts or sweats... we all human brosef
44,Insert pikachu surprise face
45,That‚Äôs enough internet for today
46,I.. impossible!
47,What if I told you that you can train yourself to see through peripheral vision?
48,Wait women knew how eyes work this whole time. No wonder they think I‚Äôm shallow üò≠
49,"This goes for women staring also. From what I've heard and my GF confirmed, women stare longer at other women's breasts than men do."
50,We know when you look at our crotch too.
51,"I bet if I walked around with half my balls hanging out, people would look at that too ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
52,"Y‚Äôall are pathetic. I‚Äôm able to have an entire conversation with any woman and not sneak a peak because I‚Äôm an adult and a gentleman and I‚Äôm waiting for them to turn around so I can peep those sweet, sweet cheeks."
53,If I get caught I give her a chance to peek at my ass cleavage to make it fair.
54,"They only know when they know. They don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know. They may have say the 1st and the 4th look but the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th‚Ä¶ etc. we‚Äôre lightening quick."
55,Thanks for the insecurities :')
56,Is this the official return of advice animals?!
57,"What if I said, I knew that and still took that peek, and still didn't GAF!"
58,Should have edited the reflection of neo into tits.
59,"What if I told you, I'm a legs guy"
60,Obligatory ‚ÄúWhat if I told you that the line ‚Äòwhat if I told you?‚Äô isn‚Äôt in The Matrix?‚Äù comment‚Ä¶ üôà
61,What if I told you that I want them to know?
62,We know you know. Cleavage is for everyone. Nobody wants to see testicles.
63,Then I'd tell you that Men know when they take a quick peek at their crotches.
64,"No they dont, because no one takes a quick peek
They take a long peek"
65,They don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know
66,"Sorry, a quick peak?"
67,This is a huge problem for me cause I hate look at people in the face and my eyes will naturally drift downward for men it's not a problem but anytime I'm speak with a woman I look like a huge pervert
68,"Now, follow up question

Do they know when you're looking at their tiddies or just admiring their shirt"
69,TRUE IT GET SO UNCOMFORTABLE
70,"Wears sunglasses ""how about now"""
71,"I didn't realize this til I got a tattoo and started noticing people looking at it ever so briefly and yet I still noticed it.

I shudder to think of how slick I thought I was... But I swear half the time it's involuntary."
72,"I saw some documentary ages ago where research team had some sensors attached to men's head to see where they were looking. Apparently most men reflectively looked at women's chest first.

I don't remember where women looked first or seconds for either."
73,"Hard to ignore, what with the frantic masturbation and all.."
74,"This cant be true, someone tell me this a joek"
75,Not if they're dead..
76,Impossible. I‚Äôve trained my peripheral vision to lvl 100. It‚Äôs physically impossible for them to know.
77,"I just keep eye contact with and the minute they look down, I‚Äôm like do I have something on me? And they‚Äôre like ‚Äúugh ugh what, no, no, no!!‚Äù It‚Äôs funny!"
78,**PANIC**
79,More than one female friend said that they don't mind as long it's not creepy
80,I just took a video of myself looking down quickly and it's very obvious.
81,"Dear women, when you wear a shirt with text written on your chest area I will read it. It's not about your chest but about literature.
 I also stare when there is no text because I am searching for magic ink."
82,"No.. it can‚Äôt be true.. 
I‚Äôm too fast, and only do it when I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt notice.!? 

Right?‚Ä¶."
83,"Some lady in other post said, 1 sec glance is 5 sec in boob stearing time"
84,I‚Äôm really really gay and I still do it. Why???
85,Not if you're in the bushes across the street
86,"Not funny but wholesome comment-

It.boosts.confidence!"
87,Hey man I can't concentrate on what your saying if one half of my brain is screaming to look at your boobs and the other half is trying not to. Just let me register your situation so we can all move on and have a fun conversation.
88,What if I told you they are aware they have their tits hanging out also.
89,"This is amateur hour. Try keeping an eye to eye contact with a woman when suddenly she to whips out her DD's and starts breast feeding her child. 

It's like putting peanut butter on your gents and walking into a dog pound."
90,"I'm supposed to look at their titties. That's why they have titties.

If not enough people look at a girl's titties she gets breast enlargements so that more people will look at her bigger titties.

Disclaimer: I ‚ù§Ô∏è  titties!"
91,That wouldn't change anything since I don't look there intentionally since thats rude
92,Can women sense you peeking without even looking at your eyes? I think they do ü§î
93,I very done it because I'm jealous lmao I want tats
94,[deleted]
95,Will they not know it if I stare for a long time?
96,"Thats why I pretend to be blind and wear the super tinted glasses

97,Boobs are the best lamp and my eyeballs identify as moths
