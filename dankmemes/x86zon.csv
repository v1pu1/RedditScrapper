1,Ok but have you tried hosting a party on a big luxurious yacht and having THE best time of your life? Me neither
2,There a mega yatch sitting on la Garonne in Bordeaux ATM. Belongs to a football team owner. Totemnam I think
3,"it's not to kill the world faster, it's to protect my specific profit-generating interests.  the world's going to kill itself no matter what i do, why shouldn't i make the most of it?"
4,Unfortunately taxes do not help the world either. If they did I might actually pay them.
5,"I thought the whole idea was to tax the rich for holding cash, so that they avoid tax by spending it on lavish things, which in turn helps the economy..."
6,"Of course I have, except the party was just me and my toaster while the big luxurious yacht was my bathtub."
7,"you're not making the most of the earth tho. you're bringing the total possible time that humanity could exist from millions of years to less than a few hundred. 


some selfish asshat you must be."
8,You're demanding a total stranger give you their money and calling them selfish?
9,"you're saying you want the whole world to end thousands of years sooner just so you can live a better life for 70 years? 


and I'm not asking you to give me money, I'm asking you to give back to the society that enabled you to gain that money. and yeah, you are being selfish if you don't pay your taxes.

edit: that last part doesn't apply if you are literally unable to have basic needs met if you pay taxes."
10,"Alright Al Gore, there's no proof that anything youre saying is true. Unless you can see the future. Take your communist shit to China or Russia."
11,"it's a necessary evil.

tbh it's possibly just being relatively young still (21) but I do not find compromising on my own life worth it if the result is some unimaginable generation hundreds of millenia later doesn't have to face the end of the world."
12,"how tf is it necessary lol. people have lived for thousands of years without having the amount of industrialization we have today, and we already have tech enabling us to get what we need without the pollution and harm it causes. 



also, it's not some generation hundreds of millennia away that faces the consequences, its the current young generation and a few generations down the road that will face them, like the people who might be your grandkids if you have them. that's how large the impact is. what right do you have to do that? it surprises me how selfish y'all responding to this comment are."
13,"you know you're exactly right. it's not necessary, I just don't really care. also not to be super rude or nothing but if people not caring on the internet surprises you then man. you gotta either see the world more or wise up fast."
