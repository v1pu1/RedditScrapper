1,Somebody once told me the trees gonna talk to me
2,It wasnt their swamp
3,We Frenches managed to lose that war 20 years before you did...
4,"Good things people in the USA don't know this, courtesy of their shitty education system"
5,"You guys wanna know the real reason?

The USA was longterm actually beating the NVA and Vietcong badly but the VC manipulated the US media into thinking the USA was losing.

This is why I only get my news from shreks magic mirror."
6,"This image would imply that shrek is an American, and implying that any army shrek is in would lose is the highest Reddit heresy. By the power of the meme lords I smite thee"
7,What is the reason?
8,"The us should have never gone to war with vietnam, we were the baddies in that one."
9,They all succumbed to the ogre and forgot there was a war. It was all ogre now.
10,US got Shornked
11,USA did not 'win' any war since WW II...
12,"Probably because of a shitty plastic gun, real VC know. Nothing stops an AK"
13,And in Afghanistan.
14,You really shouldn‚Äôt mess with peoples swamps.
15,Shrek lives in the Louisiana Bayou now
16,Is it because of the m16?
17,"These colors don't run. Actually they do. April 30, 1975, and Aug 15, 2021. Create problems and run away."
18,There just wasn't enough donkey.
19,This is obviously fake. Vietnamese shrek used aks instead of m16s that were brought by the us since they did not get stuck as much as m16.
20,It‚Äôs all ogre now
21,He‚Äôs not happy
22,"That‚Äôs a pretty damn American lookin‚Äô weapon though. Spoils of war, I guess."
23,We‚Äôll that and they had f-15s and drones
24,I ain't the sharpest soldier in the shed
25,Obligatory ‚Äùthe french lost a war? What a surprise!‚Äù
26,"The only time the French have won a war, was against themselves"
27,"Yeah, we don‚Äôt listen. For a better example of the American exceptionalism fable see Afghanistan. Hannibal, Napoleon, the soviets‚Ä¶.We saw those examples and said ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù lol"
28,The government didn't want to tell them cause they didn't want it to cause a negative impact on Shrek meme culture - one of the few things the US government have done right
29,always that one guy
30,And Reddit.
31,"Yep. The US was doing decently well pushing back, but the second the US left, the VC took over instantly"
32,So we've never lost a war? YEAH! MURICA! üá∫üá∏
33,Also this: https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/21/archives/senate-move-on-to-end-saigon-aid-bipartisan-bill-would-cut-off-all.html
34,We won the Gulf war
35,"No, but we also haven't lost any"
36,They were looking kinda dumb with their straw hats and their guns in the shape of a battle formation
37,That also means we understood the Vietnam jungle wasn't worth fighting for 20 years before you...
38,Americans love to shit on France until you get to the American revolution.
39,"Yeah the rebellion that birthed the constitution that lets you say that was funded by them and yet we run our mouths and make surrender jokes. How appreciative we are, no wonder everyone loves us‚Ä¶.."
40,"In the 1000 years of existence of my country, we probably won a few wars against other countries... We still are the country with the most military victories (yes, our country is older, and it helped...)"
41,"Napoleon ? I thought the Brits stopped him in Egypt.

And I always thought Hannibal stayed on the western side of the Mediterranean, fighting his way through Spain, France, Italy and Tunisia."
42,And Hugh neutron
43,"Yeah, people like to make the Tet Offensive look like a master stroke plan that showed how unbeatable the VietCong was, instead it was a final desperate push to try and convince the US media that they're losing, manipulating the media was a resounding success even though the VC lost thousands of experienced soldiers and they alienated the people of South Vietnam because just like true communists they killed teachers, ""free thinkers"" and government employees for no reason."
44,They lost the war on drugs lol
45,"Nope, you just contributed to countless dead bodies on both sides and giving hundreds of thousands physical and psychological problems for life, this is definitely something to be proud of."
46,Well the bullets start coming and they don't stop coming
47,"Brits: we colonised a valuable, highly populated subcontinent.

Spain: our colony (Mexico) is richer then we are.

Dutch: we colonised an island chain whit every resource imaginable and extremely fertile soil. 

France: desert looks big on map :)"
48,"but we're not french, so yeah"
49,So the french also learned that france isnt worth fighting for?
50,"The French helped us out in the revolution, we helped them out in 1812 (kind of), WWI, WWII, and the cold War. They refused to participate in our completely justified and totally legal invasion of Iraq, so we kinda shit on them.

Also, we never joined the Nazis."
51,You might beat the make believe nation of Kazakhstan?
52,"I never said it was something to be proud of, I hate that we get involved in unnecessary wars that we really can't win without killing countless citizens."
53,Gotta hit the ground and start running
54,"And lots of small islands make a big EEZ. We still are number 1 there, with 11 million km¬≤..."
55,"We'll see that in our next civil war, I guess"
56,"No, but you did let nazis frolic freely in the south, let them enjoy the pleasures of life to their every request, and even married many of them too."
57,"Well, some of you did."
58,"And it's basically a necessity to keep the war machine running and having the people in charge get richer and richer upon piles of bones. NATO-only conflicts aren't enough for it, so it's also an involvement by choice, none of it is an actual threat for the US.

And and I know it's not your fault but people should be more conscious about such things and in the ideal case try to do something about it via politics."
59,Didn‚Äôt make sense not to drop napalm
60,Fair Point.
61,"Only the scientists. Von Braun, the most well known, was hardly a Nazi. He just wanted to make rockets; he didn't care for whom he was making them. I'm not sure why you think we treated them like royalty. Didn't a lot of French folk marry Nazis too?

What was completely unforgivable was our treatment of Unit 731, but that's another story."
62,"Oh yeah, I forgot about how after the surrender of Washington the entire American armed forces including the pacific fleet and garrisons declared allegiance to the new puppet government in Chicago and joined the Axis."
63,"So many traps, so many spikes"
64,"so much to shoot, so much to kill!"
65,so what's wrong with taking an ambush
66,So what‚Äôs wrong with killing somebody
67,"You‚Äôll never blow if you go slow, you‚Äôll never die if you lie low"
68,"You‚Äôll never blow if you go slow, you‚Äôll never die if you lie low"
69,"Hey now your a soldier
Get your ass up
Get paid

Hey now your a soldier
Get your ass up 
Get paid

Cause all the bushes are people
Aiming straight at your neck"
