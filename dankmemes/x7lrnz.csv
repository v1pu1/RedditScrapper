10,"It depends. Some education is good, but it just requires that it's an exciting topic and it's well taught. If it's pointless boring work you have no motivation for, it's mostly meaningless. 

Education does a lot of good, but the good requires good education, any education won't cut it."
11,"No it's not. I found something I was passionate about and interested in, and got a degree. My education taught me technical knowledge, soft skills, life lessons, and made me some awesome friends :). It also helped me land a great job with comfortable income and fulfilling work. It wasn't easy at all, but more than worth It in the long run. Should mention as well that in my country we have really good universities and the cost of studying is relatively low."
