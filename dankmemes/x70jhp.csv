0,This is OPs suicide note... right?
1,Yikes. Simp vibes all over this
2,"So let me get this straight, you can get free porn of any genre and taste, quite often in HD or even 4K and you still choose to pay a girl because you knew her and fantasise about her, considering the unlimited number of men and women to fantasise about on the internet. Not to mention the fact you can use your fucking imagination as well?????????

You havent got a masturbation problem, you've got self respect problem"
3,Still a simp.
4,"hey man its gonna be okay, let go of the stick for a while and join me in the quest to discover how to love ones self"
5,Even by reddit standards you're pathetic
6,Know that she will never fantasize about you
7,Yep when I found a girl that I worked with had one welllllll yeah I subscribed
8,I can't decide which is worse. Paying for onlyfans or a reddit nft
9,"Thank you , most helpful, I’m cured now"
10,I don't disagree with your vibe but how does it relate to self respect?
11,"Seek help, build up the confidence to actually ask her out instead of being this much of a loser."
12,People actually pay for those? Lol
13,"I'm here for my fellow dudes and dudettes, never get in the way of yourself brother, always look forward, and enjoy yourself, I love you"
14,Would you ask out an onlyfans girl?
15,Wow -15 nice
16,"When I started talking to my current girlfriend, she had an onlyfans. It had like 1 subscriber and it was her weird ass ex.

I offered to be her camera man and the rest is history. 

Side note: she hasn’t logged in on it since we started dating."
