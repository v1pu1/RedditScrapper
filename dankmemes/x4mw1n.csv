1,We're still meming the 1% of vegans doing this?  I thought 2016 was a long time ago
2,"As a vegan I’m ashamed of how a FEW vegans try to promote veganism. The lound minority, folks. Calling someone evil for eating meat is stupid. Helps no one. Trying to relay facts and benefits of adopting a plant-based diet should be the norm. Well. I think it is, just not online"
3,The ones with common sense don't bother to get into arguments with people on the other side without common sense. The Internet is mostly filled with arguments where at least one side is being irrational in their assertions
4,Not all vegans are the same as the ones in cringe compilations
5,Tbh I see more posts bashing vegans than the other way. It’s just such a boomer thing to do
6,"Well, the reason is very simple: there aren't any real benefits of being vegan over being a moderate omnivore or vegetarian. Only downsides.

Their drive isn't health, but animal rights, a flawed parallelism between a human and an animal, and a false sense of moral high ground.

The real good reasons to reduce consumption of meat and animal products are about market exploitation and environment, and aren't about removing those products completely from your diet, but producing it in fairer and more sustainable ways. It'd be exactly the same if we had soy market exploitation instead of beef, for example, when it comes to side effects to economy, public health and environment."
7,"I wouldn’t mind you if you’re vegan but don’t keep mentioning it…I don’t want to know your eating preferences I’m not a chef


But imma just slide it here that vegetarian >> vegan."
8,"Pros:

Reduction in methane (a prominent greenhouse gas)

Less carbon pollution

better carbon sequestration

More land availability

Less pesticides and fertilizers in the air and water

Less water usage (ie: more clean water for us)

Lower chance of heart disease

Lower chance of cancer

Less likely to over indulge (meat eaters are more likely to be obese)

More affordable diet


Cons:

Getting enough calories is hard when you are working out

B vitamins are hard to get

Iron is hard to get


There are plenty ways to get the nutrients you need, and if you make a habit of including them in your diet, then you'll be fine without even having to plan out meals. Just takes a little research, shopping around and habit forming."
9,It's impressive to make an all around positive thing seem so unsympathetic.
10,"Funny how *not even once* in my life have I met a “meme vegan”. They have all been very chill, non-judgy, and happy to tell about their diet - IF someone asks about it first."
11,PETA. I feel like vegans would have a better reputation if not for them.
12,Well... No one really cares about those benefits...
13,Spot the vegan: EXTREME EDITION
14,People need to understand that you cant change peoples opinions by attacking them. That does the opposite.
15,"Is it really the vegans fault you feel guilty about eating animals? How exactly do you ""force"" your opinion on someone? Sharing an opinion is only okay if it doesn't make you feel bad about shitty choices you make?"
16,Guilt tripping is a term used to gaslight people with different morals than you. Prove me wrong.
17,Whatever you have to tell yourself man
18,Damn vegans be shitting on this post.
19,"If you had common sense you would be vegan, but here we are."
20,Ok boomer
21,Deer season is coming up lads! 🦌🍽
22,"[Here are the horros of the farming industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko)

Meat is completely not needed and most people only eat it for taste pleasure, meaning they kill animals for fun which is something we can agree is terrible. The industry kills billions of baby chickens every year and also millions of calfs, which yes, is your fault when you give money to it.

Meat is also the biggest reason for deforestation, does almost 20% of total emissions, is the biggest reason for rainforest destruction and ocean destruction, the biggest reason for land/water/food loss and the biggest reason for antibiotic resistance and pandemics.

>Common sense isn’t their strongest suite

You drink animal breast milk"
23,You should feel guilty ✌🏻
24,"I’m yet to have one of my vegan friends show me some scientific evidence rather than some YouTuber saying it. We should eat less meat, but a cow supports more biodiversity than a field of soy."
25,"It’s not guilt tripping, you guys just feel guilty cause you know your lifestyle is selfish and bad for the environment. So when presented with facts and evidence, you get mad and defensive cause deep down you know it’s wrong."
26,Just like sone religious people
27,"the real pause is why you let bananas get that ripe, eat them when the edges are green and the rest is vibrant yellow."
28,Why is elmo snorting coke?
29,Carbon footprint seems the only valid point tho. I'm not vegan but I never ate meat so I guess I don't have to be the guilty one
30,Am vegan. Agree wholeheartedly.
31,"I'm not even vegan, I do it for fun"
32,"To the 2 rational vegans



I'm sorry about your allergies"
33,"I have no problems with vegans, especially when the only reason they’re telling someone why they should go vegan is because that person ASKED why. 

The only issue I have with vegans is forcing like dogs (or just any animal that relies on meat), or literal new-borns, to eat plants only, thus forcing them to have serious health problems.

Those vegans will cry all day about how animals don’t have a choice and such, when it comes to making them into food, but they wouldn’t give their pet/baby a choice when it comes to them eating. Ironic, I know."
34,".you catch more flies with honey. Being able to clearly articulate the benefits, but also teach people respectfully. Oregon, and other western states light years ahead of the country in terms of available Vegan market. I eat some meats but mostly deer meat, and seafood. Seafood is my ultimate primal food. Could eat it all day."
35,"A woman was recently sentenced to life in prison. 

Because her 18 month old died from a vegan diet."
36,"I have a vegan sister and she's pretty cool. She doesn't force her beliefs on other people and doesn't care if I eat meat. So they aren't all bad. Screw ThatVeganTeacher though, she's a twerp."
37,Like people would listen if vegans would list benefits. Non veg is way to tasty
38,There are no benefits of being vegan...
39,"There are no benefits

Literally 

Vegetables have nothing for you but pesticides that cause cancer"
40,"Good luck, I'll never stop eating meat. If you want your body to kick ass, it needs a balanced diet."
41,The vegans that tries to get other people into the veganism are just inferior vegans. -Me a vegetarian
42,watch dominion 2018 and then come back to discuss if guilt tripping isn’t justified
43,"Guys it's your twice daily repeated ""vegans are loud and annoying"" post. The irony is so thick that I as a vegan won't have to worry about getting my iron from lentils and chickpeas this week."
44,They bring up the straw dog or straw child argument
45,"Yeah.. you feel ""guilt tripped"" by learning how meat is produced than maybe you're just ignorant and feel guilty for perfectly normal reasons? It's literally one of the rational arguments against meat consumption.

I eat meat, but when I do and think about where it comes from, it's only rational to feel bad."
46,They're a loud minority that really give a bad name for vegans
47,I really do feel bad for your community. It's easy to forget how much of a minority the loud annoying vegans are and I wish you weren't as associated with them as you are
48,"The only times I detest vegans are the few that force their newborns into that vegan diet, which has led to said babys death in multiple cases. Otherwise I try and keep to myself about that topic."
49,"Wait.. no.. impossible.

Did I just find a based vegan?"
50,As a vegetarian i agree
51,bootlicking murderers 🤦‍♀️
52,"There wouldn't be much of an argument if both sides were rational. Just one person stating non-contradictory facts, another person admitting they've been convinced and that's the end of the discussion. But of course that doesn't happen on the internet."
53,"I'm not a vegan either, far from it, but generally I think the hate is actually inner guilt. They don't want to be told what they're doing is wrong, so they channel that out as hate."
54,Tbh these anti vegan memers are cringe to the power of thousand in comparison to all the vegans I encounter in everyday life.
55,Tbf all of this really just goes back to the Vegan Teacher. She literally made hating vegans popular lol.
56,"You won't see many posts about veganism because if you're not in a vegan community these posts when get much upvotes. You can see comments about veganism in a post about vegans or meat. I remember that mister beast donated like a thousand turkeys to hungry family and then some loud preachy vegans started commenting about how he's actually not a good person for doing so and some even said that they think it's better these families stayed hungry. I know most vegans are not like this but they are the loudest ones and unless you know some ""normal"" vegans than that's all you'll see of them and the only way you'll know vegans"
57,"Around 80% of soy production is to feed to cows and other livestock, so that's an ignorant comparison to make. And what exactly are the downsides to being vegan? There is broad scientific consensus that a plant based diet is healthier than an omnivorous one."
58,There’s a lot of studies that don’t agree with this.
59,"It's way cheaper and more sustainable. Farming cattle is detrimental to the environment. There are rainforests being cut down to feed the cattle, although we are producing more plant food then the humans need. If the whole planet were to be vegan, there would be no hunger, because we would significantly overproduce.

And just to add my personal opinion: eating animals just because ""you like it"" without any need speaks to the ignorance toward animal life. I seriously hope you don't have any pets."
60,Holy shit a good take on reddit? You must be new here.
61,"[Vegans have far lower chances for gut cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35719615/) and their protein is far better and lowers their chances for [frailty](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.12972) a lot. Also [lower heart risks](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/how-plant-based-food-helps-fight-cancer/art-20457590) and [lower chances for diabetes.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-answers/diabetes/faq-20058117)   

>Only downsides

Bruh

>a flawed parallelism between a human and an animal

Humans are animals, why is there are difference between a human and a cow that means that we can kill one for taste pleasure and not the other?"
62,"Vegans do have a moral high ground just accept it. 

A person who doesn't support hurting animals and killing them compared to a person who supports killing animals and hurting them. It's a clown answer to think the former is not a moral high ground. It isn't necessary at all to hurt any animals and live a good healthy life for most people. You're simply in denial. I'm not even a vegan."
63,"That's an extremely bend view in direction of an anti vegan stance.

Where I live most people wouldn't eat meat if they would have to see how it's produced.
I still eat it though, but it's the same for me 

And the imagination of a soy production line with as bad side effects as meat production is meaningless since it doesn't exist and producing meat almost always inherently requires more soy like products."
64,[deleted]
65,"Alot on your list is highly debated though.

1.  The methane produced by meat is far from the biggest methane polluter, it's actually quite small according to some sources.

2. Depends on where you live and what types of vegetables and fruits would be more in demand if alot of people converted. Nuts and avocados are terrible polluters and there are many more examples

4. Alot of land that cattle uses is is not suitable for agriculture

5. There are alot of different fertilizers and without our current meat ecosystem alot of agriculture wouldn't be possible

6. Again it depends. Some fruits and vegetables consume alot more water than most meat production.

7 and 8. This is true for people OVER indulging in meat not healthy individuals

10. Depends on where you live.

Add to cons what I already have not mentioned

We waste alot more fruits and vegetables than we do meat and diary products not only wasting resources but also adding methane pollution 

Meat provides more nutrients than alot of vegetables and fruits

Alot of research suggest that forcing growing kids to become completely vegan can lead to increase in serious health complications and diseases."
66,"Cons: 

No tasty chicken wings 😭"
67,"methane one is bs tho, where do cows get stuff to produce it in the first place? grass, where does grass get it from? soil and atmosphere, where does soil get it from? cow poop and atmosphere, where does atmosphere get it from? cow farts. it's a closed loop, there is no new methane added from raising cows."
68,"Profile picture checks out. Also, I agree on your opinion"
69,So why aren't you vegan if it's all around postive?
70,"Yeah! Wait but what is this post then? I haven't seen a vegan post anywere ever, but I see anti vegan posts daily on this subreddit.. what is that about?"
71,forcing an opinion on someone is something I define as refusing to accept someone else's opinion and actively harassing them over it.
72,Trust me nobody feels guilty about enjoying a nice steak dinner :)
73,I promise you no meat eaters feel guilty 🤣
74,Calling someone a “murderer” or “human trash” or any other word for murderer lol.
75,"They’re an angry lot. I don’t mind the vegans that are trying to be civil and not throwing insults in my face, they chill."
76,Exactly the guilt tripping.
77,"If you had common sense, you wouldn't comment such nonsense, but here we are."
78,"Not really, people know what happen but we just don't care because we enjoy eating Cheese and Meat. It's like smoking cigar, people know it's bad but they keep doing it becuase they enjoy smoking."
79,Cool opinion bro but im still not gonna be vegan.
80,You’re literally the vegan in the post. Get off to high-horse. You eating plants really doesn’t make you special
81,"Deer sausages, oh my, ... And baked deer ribs with rosehips ..."
82,"You do know that you need more fields of soy to sustain enough cows to sustain a human than what you'd need to just having the human eat the soy *before* having fed it to a cow, right?

You're just comparing the cost of one field to the cost of multiple ones and somehow making the conclusion that the latter is better. You don't need a degree in agriculture to know that you will only lose energy by neglecting to eat something perfectly edible just feed it to an animal that you're planning to eat."
83,See what you just did there?
84,"You should consider looking at the negatives with veganism because there definitely are quite a few of them. Also alot of the statistics mainstream media uses to critize the meat industry is purposefully presented in a way that makes it look ALOT worse than it actual is when you read some of the studies they cite when they show their jaw dropping diagrams, sometimes even directly contradicts what they were trying prove. My advice always get your facts from ""neutral"" sources to the extent possible and consider both sides of the coin."
85,Stay mad while I enjoy myself some chicken wings.
86,"I've never heard about vegans complaining about choice in particular, only about *rights*. As in, the right to physical integrity and such, which is to be distinguished from personal agency, which is usually denied to both children and animals in large parts. For example, if a child or animal wants to leave the country, their legal guardian is allowed to prohibit that, while a human adult would only be denied their personal agency under special circumstances. Now I'll make the claim that 1. this system is not only descriptive but also morally viable and 2. as long as there is no pain or physical harm, food choices fall only under personal agency and not a right. As such, a parent is allowed to forbid their child from eating sweets just as a pet owner should be allowed the choice of not giving treats to their pet.

As long as you agree with what I said so far, the only question that remains is whether an animal can still be healthy if sustained only through vegan food. Because I'm not an animal nutritionist, I won't attempt to answer this question myself, but instead refer to [what people who know what exactly an animal needs write about it](https://firstvet.com/uk/articles/can-my-dog-be-vegan). To summarize what's written there:
- Sufficient vegan diets for dogs exist and are commercially available under the ""complete"" label.
- You should not give your dog anything homemade without the approval of a nutritionist.
- Cats can't eat a vegan diet."
87,">The only issue I have with vegans is forcing like dogs (or just any animal that relies on meat), or literal new-borns, to eat plants only, thus forcing them to have serious health problems.

It's horrible when people force animals into something they don't want and that could hurt them. Anyways, wanna cut a cows throat after taking her kids away, killing the kids if they're male and then eat her corpse?

Anyways

Obviously the subject needs more research but right now it's look like its healthy to feed pets healthy."
88,"It is the better approach for sure. It pollutes less, it doesn’t clog your arteries, you get more fiber which helps with digestion, you don’t run the risk pf consuming mass amounts of hormones that affect humans etc.

As for taste then yes. It is tasty. Meat tastes yummy yum, but there are loads of plant-based products that taste just as good! If you like burgers I’d recommend the Beyond Burger. I find it more tasty than normal burgers. It’s not very healthy, but neither is a normal burger. Vegan cheese isn’t the best, but it is slowly iterating and improving and becoming more cheese-like"
89,Except for the benefits
90,A planned out plant based diet is balanced
91,"I mean tbf, you can buy pasture raised meat, or stuff that was free range, pretty much anything that explicitly says that those animals weren't caged their whole lives. And then you don't have to feel guilty about the production of it because those animals were given the opportunity for a healthy and happy life for a decently long time."
92,"I feel like people learn I don't eat meat only when I'm offered meat and turn it down. I've then had people ask why I don't eat it and it always puts me in an awkward stance. If I mention it's because of the slaughtered animals/abuse, then I become preachy and make them feel guilty like this post is suggesting. Instead I just say I do it cause of climate change and my carbon footprint. They usually don't bother asking about it other than that."
93,Omnivorous parents commit child neglect in far higher numbers than vegan parents. Have you ever spoken up about that?
94,Do you have any numbers to back this up?
95,"Wait… no… impossible…

Did I just see an NFT??

Jokes aside. Thank you I think. I never really got a full grasp of what based means. And whatever it ment has been lost in internet obscurity, I think"
96,How many times are you going to comment. For someone who loves plants you sure do have a fear of touching grass.
97,"That is not always the fact. At least in terms of philosophical questions like what does death mean to an animal etc. The thing is that the species of domestic cows and goats will cease to exist if they lose importance to man. Some may evolve and survive, but most will die out in the wild. So to a cow, is the survival of a species more important or a good life? I feel like these are trolley problem questions and carry proper arguments on both sides"
98,"I hate being preached to. Same goes for religion, if a guy starts telling me why I should not be acting the way I am and actually should be acting the way he is than I am very obviously will be annoyed."
99,"I guess a downsides could be that there is a greater risk of vitamin and mineral deficiency if you don’t watch what you eat. But most vegans are already very aware of what they eat, so it’s rarely a problem. I could be wrong though"
100,"> There is broad scientific consensus that a plant based diet is healthier than an omnivorous one.

Citation needed. You are telling me that ""any"" plant based diet is healthier than ""any"" omnivorous diet? That just non-sense. Fries are vegan and yogurt is not for example."
