1,This is why you put your username on the meme somewhere. That way it'll scare off any would be reposters and the one's who go through with it get -6725 votes cuz your name is on their post.
2,and yours be sitting at -5 votes
3,When you edit a whole hentai of 10 pages for 1 month as political satire and the only thing people ask is why the sex scenes are censored
4,"I see memes on here all the time end up on Facebook a week later

And w/o the Reddit watermark!

What sorcery"
5,"Good to know I'm not alone. 

Ever had your own original meme not only get reposted and get more upvotes, but then have your original one get taken down for being a repost? 

I have. Twice. 

It's enough to make you want to just quit coming up with creative ideas to cut these fuckers off.

I'm sure you've heard of the 80/20 Rule. On Reddit it means:
20% of the memes are created by funny, creative redditors and the other 80% are the same memes reposted by lazy, unimaginative redditors who couldn't create a fart after a bean dinner.

Generally I take it as a compliment, but when the repost gets more love than the original it's infuriating."
6,Come on. Mods got a lot of being gay to do. You can’t expect them to moderate subs.
7,"*It's not about the fame it's about the content*

13,"I see a lot of those too. Before I have reddit I look at memes on fb and followed one creator. When I got reddit, I noticed that they just repost the memes on fb and get a lot of reactions. I know no one asked but I just want to tell what my heart has to tell."
14,"I forgot the word, so I explained it instead."
15,Nailed it.
