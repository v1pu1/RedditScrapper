37," That‚Äôs wrong, Taiwan is the Republic of China."
38,The China bots aren‚Äôt here yet to ‚ÄúWell Akshully‚Äù about calling it West Taiwan.
39,"Americans showing their ignorance once again.

For those who don't want to be ignorant: Taiwan is actually called the Republic of China (while mainland China is called the People's Republic of China). The Republic of China (RoC) is the remnant of the side that lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and escaped to Taiwan. The RoC still claims China, and more (including Tibet and some lands which are not even part of the PRC right now). So the nightmare wouldn't be people calling mainland China ""West Taiwan"", it would be a world where the Nationalists (what the side that escaped to Taiwan are called) had won the civil war."
40,Taiwan belongs to China. Deal with that.
41,Glorious to our West Taiwan. How's your morning sleep Mr. President?
