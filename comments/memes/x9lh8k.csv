0,Only 4.95?! That's a fuckin steal!
1,I had something like this as a kid. You would run a steal skewer through the length of the hotdog and attach it to electrodes and place in a cradle like holder. Turn it on and it would run current through the dog to cook/heat it up. It was dangerous as all hell. Like The Cornballer from Arrested Development kinda dangerous.
2,Never tried electro-stimulation
