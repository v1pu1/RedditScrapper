6,I love corgis
7,Wait...does this mean you bang your dog ? Wtf.
8,Dogs don't ask if they look fat in the collar their wearing
9,"It's more like because they're missing out on the joy of having grandchildren.  
Grandma fever is real. Once your mom starts meeting with her siblings and friends and they're bringing out pictures of their grandchildren they get a real sense of FOMO. They get all nostalgic about their own kids and want to have those experiences again."
10,"And no dog is even better, but hey, I have 2 kids and a wife.

It's a shame that this kind of content wasn't available at my early stages of adulthood in my country.

Nothing against marriage but it is what it is.

Kids are nothing but a financial black hole and a constant source of disappointment.

Wife is nice tho.

Enjoy the big bucks. ü•Ç"
11,Unconditional love vs taking half ur money
12,"Missing out? On what? Watching my Children grow up in Poverty and struggle for mere Survival in a World that's already been fucked for my own Generation, with absolutely no Reason to believe ""Top"" Politicians are for some Miracle just going to stop being the corrupt, self centered, respectless and either ignorant or racist Pieces of Shit they are while effectively denouncing and sabotaging those very few who try to actually represent the People and aid them?"
13,When people spend as much on their dogs as they do their kids üòÇ
14,my life in a nutshell
15,"For even less maintenance, get a cat"
16,YOU FUCKING A DOG?
17,So true after your done fucking your dog she doesn't want to talk about her feelings
18,"Doesn't matter, had sex"
19,Ya know money really isn't a problem if you just don't go for the gold diggers
20,Doggystyle at its peak
21,"This is true, however a girlfriend would be nice"
22,People automatically assuming that a gf will satisfy them sexually.
23,"I'm an empty nester and I never saw the point or joy in raising a kid.

Stick with the dog."
24,Cope for cant get a girlfriend...
25,"Sorry mom, i'm not repeating your mistakes"
26,"1. Having a girlfriend reduces the cost of living

2. Having a dog is not cheap"
27,I mean you can fuck the dog too.
28,Dogs are expensive too
29,\*Me who owns a dog and was an intern in a vet clinic\*: Yeah that's not how that usually goes.

32,You can‚Äôt have kids with that
33,"I misread this as ""when I get a dog as a girlfriend"" lol made me do a double take"
34,Wow these comments are very telling‚Ä¶
35,"You could also get a cat. They're even less maintenance and money! Of course, this comes with the tradeoff of them being temperamental little fucks, but it's quite worth it!"
36,wot the dog doin?
37,"cats are ok too but they are more like people who just happens to be living with you, eat your food, and hurt you both physically and emotionally for no apparent reason"
38,me without a partner OR an animal counting ALL my cashü§£ü§òüèªüëçüèª
39,average girlfriends fan vs average wives enjoyer
40,Cope
41,Is it too late to trade my kid in for a dog??
42,Yall need to reevaluate ur decicions. Not about the children thing. But about a dog being better than a genuine relationship.
43,Based
44,You clearly don't pay rent
45,demoralisation is thicc here
46,dogs can't friend zone you.... right?
47,stop fucking dogs
48,Now you can make hybrid babies üëç
49,"Dog provides a roll, pulls security duty 24/7"
50,What are you doing to the dog ü´µüò∞
51,"And a dog is certain to really love you for who you are, with girlfriends it might take a couple or more to finally get one who has the same amount of love for you as you do for her.
Although you will kinda look like a loner when you're 30 with just a dog. But hey, who cares as long as you're happy"
52,A cat is more similar to an infant in how it's affection works
53,Dog instead of girlfriend‚Ä¶  Holup!
54,"The girlfriend is not the problem, as long as you trade them out every year or so and do not have kids."
55,Dogs are way worse than children to take care of. Can‚Äôt bring them anywhere and you have to be by their side 24/7 in the dying process. So you‚Äôd still need at best a gf to split work
56,"It's all fun and games until you realize that a dog is just as smelly and high-maintenance as a child except it will never turn into a functioning human that has hopes and dreams.

To each their own though."
57,They will have the last laugh when you get pink eye from that money. ü§£
58,I like having kids but it should‚Äôve a conscious choice.
59,I would get a girlfriend if I could get them like a dog...
60,pet insurance is a thing ?
61,"Dogs and Gf and pretty interchangeable if you think about it, the worse parts of this is they are interchangeable in everyway possible."

63,Good idea
64,You sound like you are talking from experience
65,Not with that attitude
66,doggystyle
67,"my preference

dogs are way better

people are just shit"
68,![gif](giphy|eeUJaTwsHh3tswkaYm|downsized)
69,A hole is a hole. And what do we do when we find one?
70,They‚Äôre
71,"you know what goodby   
guess will have to fix it without you"
72,"Ah yes, I am too stressed right now thinking about my dog's school fees"
73,Only if both of you work high paying jobs
74,I mean technically yes but I can fuck you too.
75,There is no way your saying a dog cost as much as kids.
76,"Pet insurance and pet medical/vet insurance are, indeed, things."
77,"Yes, have 3 large dogs and use nationwide. They cover 90% of all medical costs up to $8000 a year per dog."
78,Hol‚Äôup
79,Shhiiiieettt....you right
80,"I believe he was referring to the fact that it could be interpreted as being in a relation where gf = dog (like bestiality if you want).

84,You don‚Äôt go to free schools???
85,Aight let's go. No homo tho.
86,"Not as much. But it still costs you to keep it alive by feeding it and keeping healthy by walking them and paying for medicine. Kida like a kid. A very hairy kid that walks on 4 legs (If it has all of them) and that lives only \~15 years.

Kid lite."
87,"thats so cool, can you tell me how much you pay for your insurance?"
88,ah shit. not what *i* meant. i just like doggos
89,No. WE MAKE IT BIGGER!
90,"I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúsheer‚Äù would work in place of ‚Äúthey‚Äôre,‚Äù but whatever you‚Äôd like, I guess"
91,Got your socks ready?
92,[deleted]
93,It‚Äôs about $50 a month per dog. It varies by size and age. If they‚Äôre older it‚Äôll be a little more expensive since they‚Äôre likely to have more issues. We‚Äôve used them for 3 years now and end up with net savings every year. Also just for piece of mind since if there was a major operation they needed it would be covered.
94,Yeah that's what it seems to me too.
95,Ye... we *all* do...
96,[deleted]
97,"Same. It's about 35$/mo for our 9-year-old chihuahua/terrier mix. We've done the math and for his routine care (exams and various legally required vaccinations like rabies) it would come out to $800/year, so we're overall coming out ahead."
98,oh for *fuck's* sake
99,No fucking shit
100,You did an upsi my guy.
