0,He admitted before that he doesn’t care about being labeled as good or not. How he’s doing it he has complete control and can keep making stupid money acting dumb with his friends. That’s the dream dude
1,"Sandler has been in several good movies. The man can act, he just doesn't care about it unless he does."
2,That Netflix one where he’s a basketball scout isn’t actually that bad. Pretty decent.
3,I like billy Madison and happy gilmore
4,"Maturing is realizing that movies don't have to be critically good to be a fun time. If I go into a movie and enjoy it, I think it's a good movie, even if it's objectively bad. I unironically like most Adam Sandler movies because everything he puts out is just him dicking around and writing his friends into films and having a good time. He does what he wants and has fun doing it, and I respect him for that."
5,"People that think uncut gems was his first good movie have clearly never seen punch drunk love or Spanglish or reign over me

Edit: I completely forgot funny people, which I think might be one of his best movies."
6,Happy Gilmore was bad? I loved that movie
7,Punch Drunk Love? Anyone?
8,Bro he has some great movies get off my boy
9,> still making tons of money and being nice guy at the same time.
10,He is very funny
11,Hustle was good as well. Happy Gilmore. Billy Madison. The Waterboy.
12,"The Meyerowitz Stories.

Other good performances:

The Waterboy

Punch-Drunk Love

Spanglish

Funny People

Uncut Gems

Hustle



Edit: I don't know how to type the words one below the other on Reddit."
13,At this point he’s an omen. You either see him on the poster and go “Oh wow! They got Adam Sandler to do this movie! Awesome!” Or see him on the poster and go “Oh god… Oh no…”
14,And zohan?
15,"Maybe he just does what he enjoys? Not concerning himself with whether or not people like it because he does, and what does it matter as long as you're doing what you like? Don't get me wrong, most of him movies are atrocious, but I also really don't care, I am able to just not watch them and move on with my life."
16,"Hold on I'll let you finish, but Click was one of the greatest movies of this generation."
17,"Happy Gilmore anyone?

![gif](giphy|iyTLKO7JwvMFG)"
18,hey Punch Drunk Love is fucking amazing
19,"Reign Over Me is a great movie too, I remember watching it for the first time and it actually made me cry, I don't even feel bad about it."
20,I like Little Nicky.
21,I love all his movies.. I can enjoy them multiple times..they are not in my favorites but its just nice to watch them...
22,"Can someone help me understand this post a bit better, given Punch Drunk Love, Funny People, Spanglish, etc.? Is the joke that those movies are bad? I’m confused."
23,Longest yard dude
24,[deleted]
25,"I very much enjoy Adam Sandler's ""shitty"" movies, thank you very much."
26,"Punch Drunk Love will always be my favorite ""good"" Sandler flick. Happy Gilmore will always be my unqualified favorite. Going to my happy place."
27,"Sandler is a decent actor. 

And has been in some good stuff that shows what he can do.

But why go through all the effort when you and your friends can get paid millions to half ass your way through a movie that also lets you go to top vacation spots for free? 

I'd argue shit Like grown ups and jack and Jill, which are absolute piles of crap, are more well known and where watched by more people then uncut gems.

Why put in the all effort and hard work when more people are gonna watch the easy to pump out garbage anyway?


Another example is Nick cage.

He can act, movies like pig show us that.
But why bother when you can be on shitty movies that don't require any real effort and get paid the same if not more."
28,Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates were the real ones
29,Someone isn't old enought to remember Punch-Drunk Love.
30,Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish
31,I really liked Punch Drunk Love.
32,"Adam Sandler is living the life we all envy: make dumb romcoms with ya boys in a remote vacation destination opposite a 30-something smokeshow you get to make out with.

Also richer than God."
33,"Who would you rather bone, Meg Ryan or Jack Nicholson?

Jack Nicholson now, or 1974?

1974.

Meg Ryan."
34,"I love his shitty movies, their better then Uncut Gems in my opinion 

edit: I liked Uncut Gems but he has better movies, The Cobbler is seriously good"
35,"You can love him or hate him. You can love or hate his movies. To each their own. But when it comes to Adam Sandler, I respect that the man genuinely had his goals, stuck to them, and stuck to his own ways even when people didn’t want him to"
36,Also: “wear basketball shorts and sneakers your entire adult life and also to award shows and dates.”
37,Why is no one talking about Zohan? Really good movie
38,Punch Drunk Love proved he was a good actor over 20 years ago.
39,I cry everytime I watch Click
40,"12 year old detected. 

Go watch Punch Drunk Love kiddo or Billy Madison, Sandler proved his range time and time again."
41,"I didn't really like Uncut Gems, turned it off after an hour, and as someone said above Punch-Drunk Love was way better."
42,*Leaves out the fist fight with Bob Barker and how Adam Sandler now produces The Price is Right.*
43,I love his movies. Mostly “Grown ups”
44,"Punch, Drunk, Love. I thought it was great!"
45,Fuck you happy Gilmore is funny
46,Idk…Eight Crazy Nights a classic
47,What about 50 First Dates?
48,"""Pixels"" is pretty good imo"
49,Hustle was actually a really good movie too.
50,Hustle is also a good movie.
51,"His movies are the lay back and chill. I liked the one where hes training prisonners to play handegg against their guards, despite me being anti-sports, click was fun, the one where he was babysittting son of hia friend and taught him to cover stains with newspapers was great..."
52,"Adam Sandler making ""movies"" is having Netflix pay him and all his friends to go on an island vacation for 3 months every year. 200 IQ play and people watch the movies. So really you're paying for these movies to be made with your Netflix subscription."
53,"While Sandler movies are considered shit, most of them have a good message"
54,"His movie Reign Over Me with don chedelle is great, also hustle was great too

Reign over me was the first movie of his I ever saw where I realized he could act really well"
55,$420-million net worth helps justify this.
56,Reign Over Me is actually one of his best drama movies aside from Uncut Gems. He's with Don Cheadle in this film. Soundtrack was sung by Eddie Vedder himself.
57,Happy Gilmore is perhaps the best sports-related comedy ever made.
58,Also Spanglish.
59,"Reign Over Me and Punch-Drunk Love also show he can act, both great movie."
60," ""Nudie magazine day""

""Nudie magazine day"""
61,"He may make shitty movies, but they're funny shitty movies!"
62,"Um, excuse me....Spanglish??"
63,Unpopular opinion - he’s better in Spanglish and it’s a better movie
64,Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison will always be some of my favorite movies. I love the immature sense of humor they have
65,Talk shit about Grown Ups 1 & 2 and you’ll have to deal with me
66,Why do people think a actors talent is only as a good as the movie? There’s more to a movie then just the acting. There can be good actors in bad movies and bad actors in good movies. Like for example I don’t like grownups but that doesn’t mean I don’t like Adam sandlers acting in it.
67,"Hustle was awesome. Love Happy Gilmore as well, a classic to me!"
68,Uncut gems was so overrated
69,Uncut gems sucks tho lol. Plot isn't there.
70,"He’s got some really good ones in my opinion though. Big Daddy, 50 First Dates, Happy Gilmore."
71,Uncut Gems is vastly overrated. Just Sandler being obnoxiously loud with an over the top accent.
72,Shitty movies? Have you seen big daddy?
73,"Unpopular Opinion:

Uncut Gems was one of his worst movies. Super boring flick."
74,I love his movies what you smokin
75,"Good movie, but I hate it.

Its non-stop anxiety inducing. It’s on purpose and really well done, but it makes watching it hard."
76,Bro you’re hella trippin if you don’t think that Basketball movie was good as fuck.
77,"Adam Sandler is a GOAT. Bring on the hate, but you gotta love him!"
78,You Don't Mess With the Zohan is my guilty pleasure. That Hezbollah hotline scene always has me in splits
79,Bruh who else couldn’t stand uncut gems? That movie wasn’t entertaining at all. Stopped watching after like 20min
80,Uncutgems is overrated
81,Uncet gems was the worst movie I've ever seen
82,I have a big guilty pleasure in Ridiculous 6
83,I know you didn’t just say that.
84,I loved uncut gems. It was amazing to see him and a different light.
85,"Rather interesting that you had to tell us what the one good movie was. If he is such a shitty actor, wouldn't everyone know?"
86,Tropical storm is top movie.
87,His birthday is in a few days on the 9th
88,Didn't he say he picks scripts based on where he wants to take his family on vacation?
89,"water boy, happy gilmore"
90,I really liked Murder Mystery
91,His baby accent voice is hella infuriating imo
92,Spanglish proved to the haters my boy can act
93,Ich liebe seine Filme gerade kindsköpfe 1 und 2
94,Do people really enjoy watching grown ups
95,Pixels wasn’t that bad
96,"Nobody here see Bulletproof? 
KEATS, YOU WERE LIKE MY FUCKIN BROTHER!"
97,I really enjoyed Hustle as well
98,Hubie Halloween was actually very funny.  My least favorite character was Adam Sandler but he wasn't bad.  I just liked everyone else more.
99,I like the grownups movies tho
100,hes actually known for flipping between making garbage and great movies
