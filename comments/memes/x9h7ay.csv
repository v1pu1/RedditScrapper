0,As long as they continue to defend their pedophile relative and keep him from facing justice the only memes made about the royal family should be about how they do just that
1,"I don't understand how you think they're protecting him. They've done more to punish him than the lawyers in the US have.

No one in either country has charged him with a crime. Do you want them to throw him in London tower or something?"
2,Just to be clear here: I hate Andrew and agree he's a pedophile. But they haven't protected him.
3,He needs to be thrown off the tower
4,I'd agree but without him being charged and tried... They literally can't
5,"They can do whatever they want realistically they're the royal family. 

Edit: it's probably in their best interest to do so before people start calling for their heads instead of just his"
6,This is not how the royal family works
7,You... Realize the Royal Family's Power is constitutionally and lawfully limited right? The UK isn't North Korea. Until someone charges him with a crime and they hide him in a castle. I don't think you can say anything about protecting him
8,You do realize that they infact CAN'T do whatever they want right?
9,They can literally do whatever they want. They choose not to because it would open gates for the rest of them to be prosecuted
10,I thought that the ruler of the UK could do literally whatever they want? They just don't usually do stuff like that. Is that completely wrong? It might be. Idk.
11,They can apparently rape minors
12,No see what you don't understand is that they CAN'T do whatever the fuck they want
13,"Go charge him.

It's a US case anyhow. Not under British law. Write them a letter or something"
14,"Legally, the ruling monarch can do whatever they want, as any legal judgement is passed by the judge using the power entrusted to them by the king/queen. The king/queen, obviously, can simply take away the judge's legal ability to pass a verdict."
15,There are major efforts here to do so. Biggest issue is royal funds paying off prosecutors that were originally so enthusiastic about prosecution and magically stopped caring
