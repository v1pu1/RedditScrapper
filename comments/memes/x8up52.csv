0,Everytime when i ve got nightshift
1,Better at 6am than in the afternoon under the Hot Sun
2,No we just start with the hardest tasks
3,Man your own jackhammer.
4,Yeah you're welcome for fixing your roads you bunch of ungrateful little shits
5,"”It start with, one thing..”"
6,then they all quiet all rest of their time there after you wake from night shift
7,"If I'm awake at 4am to get to work by 6am, I'll make all the noise I want. 

Plus the money is phenomenal."
8,I work nights 10pm-7am. I’m totally fine with construction workers doing work early in the morning. I don’t go to bed til 12pm anyway. Would rather they make their noise at 6am than 2pm when I’m in bed. Maybe all the assholes during the day will finally understand what it feels like to be kept awake when they want to sleep huh
9,Or when you’re sleeping at any given time in NY
10,My mom too
11,Nah for me it’s like 9pm.
12,Ons a weekend?
13,Always worth checking local laws when it comes to this kind of noise. Where I am 11pm to 6am are quiet hours.
14,"We know it sucks, but the shovel hammer will tire you out and we want to get the trenches dug before the sun is cooking us to death."
15,"I change drainage pipes under the road and the first thing we have to do to do the job is cut the road with a demo saw, man is that thing loud!!!"
16,"In Finland if you are working near civilication, you are not allowed to start before 7am.  Pretty nice because i dont want to get up so early and go to work."
17,Next time don't hire the cheapest driveway company and we won't be outside your house hammering out your busted ass concrete driveway and sidewalk at 6am.
18,Too real. Just happened to me yesterday.
19,"Every day I'm drilling holes into the foundation of a house to stub rebar in there. At 5:30. Sometimes as early as 4:30

We're concrete finishers, and we usually have mud on the ground by 6:15, which is the loudest part (unless we use a troweling machine / saw cutter)"
20,Yes. If i have to be awake you have to be too.
21,The earlier you start the earlier you get home
22,They could do it at night before everyone goes to sleep IDK.
23,How dare you come to me with logic and experience when I am offended
24,"The roads here are shit, nice try."
25,"lmao 99% of noise comes from real estate tho, nice try"
26,Could you do it any fucking slower
27,Just do the heavy duty shit later you dumbass
28,Facts bro
29,It was 7:44 am today so I think they were in the clear
30,Fair enough
31,I don't even know where they are. I think the property they are working on is sort of connected to the same backyard
32,Why does the mud only appear at 6:15? Is it a consequence of your work?
33,Very German thinking
34,Lmfao that's cute
35,Sorry won't happen again
36,I could in fact because I get paid by the hour
37,Concrete usually arrives anywhere from 5:50 to 6:10 ish for 6:00 delivery and it can take 5-10 minutes to mix enough water in to make it workable. We make sure to be at the job site about 1/2 hour before then
