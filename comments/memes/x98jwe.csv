48,"This has very little to do with your actual comment, but itâ€™s genuinely surprising to me when I see a person who is, essentially, uninformed when it comes to extinct animals (especially dinosaurs) actually describe them (somewhat) correctly; animals but just very large (most of the time). 

Unfortunately most of the time I just see people who either choose to believe that dinosaurs are monsters, or have never considered they might be anything *more*, usually influenced by Jurassic Park&sequels. I guess itâ€™s just refreshing to see someone who (I infer) has little paleontological knowledge think of dinosaurs specifically as justâ€¦ animals. 

Anyway sorry for the ramble."

50,And some scones
