and u name it ""peppa and george paste""..."
6,kemnist
7,Fucking genius how did I not think of that
8,double freshness
9,That's 18/20 but you could keep doing that until the percentage is 99.99% approval and you can round it up to 100%
10,"18/10=1.8 dentists recommend

Congratulations you played yourself."
11,"Pro tip: consider the 1/10 dentist an outlier and subtract their opinion from presented data, 9/9 dentists recommend"
12,doctors want to know your location
13,so its actually 8/10
14,r/the20thdentist
15,in math terms doesnt it mean that 1.8dentists reccomend it
16,"First rule of math, if you apply something to one side you have to apply it to the other. So you either suck at math, or you killed 10 dentists."
17,ü§ìit‚Äôs actually 18/20ü§ì
18,I sometimes put different colors of toothpaste to get different flavors. Get creative like food.
19,I think you mean 18/20 doctors recommend
20,Or me mixing all shampoos of my mom to get a super potion
21,This man knows too much... arrest him!
22,Big brain moment W
23,Fucking genius
24,We use two toothpastes every day. Deep cleaning no fun toothpaste before bed. Zingy refreshing gel in the morning.
25,Well it‚Äôll become 18/20
26,I laughed way too hard at this. Like couldn‚Äôt breathe laughter
27,Finally! A meme that is not related to Queen Elizabeth!
28,(9/10)√ó(9/10)=0.81
29,"And the new scientific discoveries mixing shampoo, conditioner, and soap bubbles in the tube!"
30,"Multiplying fractions, MULTIPLYING!"
31,100/10
32,Bruh i eat it and mixing with soda and drink normal
33,Witch craft
34,"Y‚Äôall mixing stuff, someone gona make a bomb"
35,**ASCEND**
36,Chemistry level 69
37,Your math is blowing my mind
38,"*wait... that's illegal!*

# someone arrest this man"
39,"Nah 18/10 is way too low, will mix 3 pastes for a 27/10"
40,"18/20*

You can't win"

43,A U B = A + B - A ‚à© B
44,18/20
45,+100 intelligence
46,umm akshually it'd be 18/20 ü§ìü§ìü§ì
47,"Hah, I used Cunningham theorem on ya all, to give me the correct answer üòâ"
48,"Got free 100 karma from all the upvotes, let's go Cunningham theorem rocks xD"
49,There was this candy goo in the 90s that came in a test tube and had a worm in it. I used to collect them and mix them with water and toothpastes to work on my 8 yr old chemistry. Dexter's lab was an inspiration to me
50,thats 18/20 smhing my head
51,"I think it would be 4,5/10 instead of 18/10..."
52,Me mixing 2 soaps to make them stronger
53,You are the FIRST meme I‚Äôve seen that doesn‚Äôt mention the queen
54,"Ackshuwally, it will be 18/20"
55,"Pff nerd, I used to mix different sodas to get drunk"
56,But what if it's multiplicative? Then you only have 8.1/10
57,You are too dangerous to be left alive.
58,If it is 9/10 then it should be 18/20
59,Wouldn't it be 18/20 dentists technically?
60,18/20
61,Rinse with mouthwash and Dettol
62,Put it on an apple ‚Ä¶ doctors will literally implode
63,Also me : mixing up pepsi and fanta ;)
64,Sounds good to me
65,"To be fair, most dentists hate 8 year olds anyway."
66,"if you add soap into the mix, 18/10 dentists and 12/10 soap experts recommend it"
67,Yeah^Yeah
68,Fractions 0/100
69,Depends if they ask the same dentists or not
70,He‚Äôs 8 y/o. He hasn‚Äôt learned fractions yet
71,"Shhhh, we don't do logic here, only funne"
72,"8/10 + 10/10 = 18/10 

Hence proved 

You are wrong /s"
73,maf hard
74,That's the joke.
75,r/whoooooosh
76,"Hey, congrats on getting baited. How does it feel being an absolute fool?"
77,- ü§ì
78,9/10 +9/10 = 18/10 learn to math.
79,"‚ùå tear gas

‚úÖ peppa paste"
80,"It's actually 9/10 + 9/10 = 18/10, since they're adding two different toothpastes."
81,Why didn't I think of that!
82,since you divide 18 dentists by 10 dentists you get 1.8 and the dentists cancel each other out
83,r/woooosh
84,Thank you!
85,He‚Äôs adding the two together tho
86,"If you were to actually take seriously it would be avg(9/10, 9/10) = 9/10"
87,"It's actually 9/10 + 9/10 = 18/10, since they're adding two different toothpastes."
88,"It's actually 9/10 + 9/10 = 18/10, since they're adding two different toothpastes."
89,"It's actually 9/10 + 9/10 = 18/10, since they're adding two different toothpastes."
90,r/woooosh

92,"Can confirm, was 8 and dentist hated me"
93,"Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?"
94,"Well, the same 9 dentists could say yes to both, and therefore it would still be 9/10"
95,"Not how probability works
These are independent events"
96,"It's actually 9/10 + 9/10 = 18/10, since they're adding two different toothpastes."
97,"I however, am multiplying them"
98,Ahh... That makes sense
99,"Can confirm, am u/theUnholyVenom's dentist and hated him back then."
