0,"You could also replace Wikipedia with Reddit and ""was"" with ""Harambe welcoming to heaven memes"""
1,"Bros saying ""finally"" like its something good somebody died"
2,It still says “Elizabeth II is the Queen of the United Kingdom” though.
3,"""Will"""
4,Honorable mention to the Wikipedia editor changing the anthem from “God Save the Queen” to “God Save the King”.
5,As a German it took me way to long to understand the joke.
6,Queen Elwasabeth
7,R.I.P.
8,Finally??
9,Somehow this one made me the most sad :(
10,Why the fuck are you saying finally?!?! It’s not like a relief she died it’s a stressor
11,who is faster? a Wikipedia editor or a rule34 artist?
12,The german version was changed within the hour of the announcement of her death.

15,"People die all the time. It's sad, but it was going to happen someday.

Such is the cruel reality of life.

Dood was probably just saying it happened - not malicious.

Probably.

Humans, humans, humans."
16,It's so insensitive to the survivors.  Her husband lost his cousin today.
17,"It was, my whole building is celebrating."
18,"Can't ""finally"" be used in a neutral context? I don't think that word implies that it's good."
19,Better her than me.
20,Because she still is Prince Charles will be the king in the next few days though

22,People are killed when they died.
23,Wrong sub to mourn a royalist
24,Mfw god doesn’t save the queen
25,??
26,Context?
27,"Yeah its no big deal for me aswell but yk, I guess I understood that wrong"
28,"I think ""finally"" is used if someone was waiting for something for some time and idk if that is used in a good context"
29,"Nope, that’s either just google paying respects, or not being updated yet (probably the former)

Charles is already King Charles III. He hasn’t had an official coronation yet (I think) but he’s still technically king the moment the queen died (I think)"
