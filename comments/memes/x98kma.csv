0,"No more ""the queen can move in any direction"" memes anymore?"
1,"Only good monarch is a dead monarch.

These people had the best spawn point on the planet, do nothing their whole life and live off of tax money.

Why do they get glorified again? Mind blowing."
2,O7
3,Princess Diana begs to differ
4,Stop the cap
5,"Seriously though, was she a good monarch? I have only seen her in ceremonial settings, speaking at important events, and donating to some charities. I can't say that this is noteworthy, in my opinion. I know the monarchs im Britain were supposed to not have a practical role in ruling but still. 

 Could someone more knowledgeable give more details?"
6,The entirety of Ireland thinks otherwise
7,Now THIS is a wholesome meme
8,Good monarchs dont exist
9,Cringe
10,Second time seeing her with the same format
11,More like the only
12,I'm already tired of hearing about it
13,people told she was the best because she is older than death itself.
14,Repost?
15,"Can't believe people are making memes of someone's death  


We live in a weird times, where people that lost someone post an instagram story with sad emojis, or people making memes of dead famous people, truly bizarre"
16,exactly man
17,She served in WW2 as an engineer while her husband served on HMS Valiant that’s something noteworthy. AFAIK she didn’t abuse the common folk to like other monarchs did hundreds of years ago although that’s something else
18,"She oversaw the transition of Britain away from empire and by in large had a hands-off approach, allowing her nation the most democratic freedom it’s ever had. 

I’d say that being a person with incredible political power and influence, but choosing NOT to exercise it for the sake of your people’s own self-determination is noteworthy and even praiseworthy."
19,Made this myself I just got the template off google
20,"I haven't seen any making fun of her death. At worst, I see a few making fun of the idea she was immortal."
21,"Being a decent ruler after having not so positive examples is definitely noteworthy. Also that's interesting, I didn't she was an engineer. Was she a great student?"
22,"Haha, Tumblr fucking explodes, Queens death day is going to be their new party holiday. 

Trashy folks, and I thought Tumblr couldn't be more cringe"
23,"It's just strange  


Seems disrespectful to me"
24,"I’m not sure if she was but she a was successful and can drive heavy trucks ( knowing how to do it ). She was also one of the few in the woman of the British Army, while being trained to be an engineer. She probably made a big difference for the evolution of equality in GB"
25,"For real, I was starting to like tumblr (mostly seen via their subreddit), but how they're acting about this event is honestly sickening."
26,I think it's just you. This is just the memers' way of paying respects.
