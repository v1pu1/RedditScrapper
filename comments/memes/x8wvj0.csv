49,"Not defending that guy as I donâ€™t know his motives, but weâ€™ve never been taught what Hitler did, the only thing that the public knows is that Hitler was a man who caused WWII and wanted to conquer the earth, everyone thought of him as a fighter and as kids we never learned about what he actually did till we grew up and researched it ourselves."
50,As I understood from the page that posted the original picture. A guy in Egypt dressed  as Hitler took pictures with people and maybe autographed mein Kampf (the book the kid holding).
51,Egypt is extremely antisemitic country. Ethnic cleansed all of it's Jewish population in living history.

64,No it means the servant of hitler
65,Hipstler
66,Well at least his signing mein Kampf copies for fans ( unironically the book in the kids hand but the Arabic edition)
67,"In Germany, everyone learns at school what he/the Nazis did and I, as a German, don't think this is funny, I think that this is sad. People like what they did and that's not (in my opinion), since killing people because of their religion is something that should have never happened."
68,Wow what a pos
69,another fellow arab
70,Didn't the grand mufti of Jerusalem met him and suggested to send muslims to help with the holocaust?
71,"Islamic world does not hate the Jews, they hate Zionists."
72,Almost like theres an actual good reason arabs hate jews or more percicly zionists its not like you guys invaded an arab country that welcomed you and destroyed it and committing warcrimes over it and kicking people out of there homes do to there ethnicity and marking arab homes but hey at least islam is slowly but surely reclaiming israel look at the fastest growing religion there
73,Oh! Thank you for translating the cover. Makes sense.

77,"Life around here is not like how it is in the west, you can talk about hitler all you want even with kids, no one gives a shit"
78,"Itâ€™s Egypt, what did you expect"
79,"Not only met with him, he also took part in the Nazi war machine.

>It is the duty of Muhammadans in general and Arabs in particular toÂ  drive all Jews from Arab and Muhammadan countriesÂ ... Germany is also struggling against the common foe who oppressed Arabs and Muhammadans in their different countries. It has very clearly recognized the Jews for what they are and resolved to find a definitive solution [endgÃ¼ltige LÃ¶sung] for the Jewish danger that will eliminate the scourge that Jews represent in the world

Nice guy"
80,"We don't hate Jews in general, we hate the bastards who invaded our land, killed our people, committed war crimes against them and acted like the victim."
81,We've done it boys! The Palestinian conflict is no more!
82,"Bro, they wouldn't care about hitler if he didn't try to kill jews.

This conflict is just the muslims quest to kill the jews in the name of their god, they take pride in it."
83,Its the same thing..literally same thing my guy
84,"Yea, that is why you ethnic cleansed all the Jews in your countries. Because Zionism."
85,It's not like they did it first and there were already a bunch of Jews in Israel.
86,So when your people kicked out the other people that didn't count?

88,"If bob the banana is in college and your his son. Ê˜_Ê˜ . We don't know who the mother is.

90,Bc of rampant antisemitism?
91,"The conflict will end when the people who did the wrong things admit it and try to solve the problem, which ... Will not happen any time soon."
92,"My country have cities of jews, stop bs.

And every year thousands come, if it's not safe, why do they come back ?

Stop crying, telling your side of the story."
93,"are you blind? their is literal no source that says we killed jews, your theodor hertzl is the one who bought jews here and told them to kill palestinians, you didnt come in peace, you came to steal our land"
94,dont think too deeply about the banan lore
95,We just don't give a shit about anything
96,"No, dictators find him a very good figure.

If you as a kid found that a dictator made Germany a great country then you won't minde having a dictator in your country"
97,"So you don't live in a Muslim country. My statement is correct.

Anything else?"
98,I bet a carton drawing of Mohamed says different
99,"Depends on how many millions they murdered, but I guess I'm idealistic"
100,"I am not confused, you are"
