0,Well 250 years ago the British monarchy was imposing taxes and governing without any input from the people of America in parliament. Now we don’t have that and are close allies with the UK. Times are different so options are going to be different
1,"I feel like this meme answers itself. That was 250 years ago. All the people you have beef with our dead, and the Queen did not go to war with the Unites States."
2,People are just crying about it to get upvotes
3,"We didn’t go to war with the King.   We went to war with Parliament,  and we begged the King to save us.    And he turned his back.     So we made a new King.    A better King.   

But we were pretty clear it was the mismanagement of it all,  not necessarily the structure we had a problem with.

4,Yeah even the French are. Ridiculous
5,Best one yet
6,"""the queen is an exception"""
7,gnivlovE
8,I think I'm the only person in the the US who literally doesn't gaf
9,I know it's so strange almost like what happened was generations ago and doesn't affect any living American today....ಠ⁠_⁠ʖ⁠ಠ
10,Have you seen the leaders we've had recently? We wished the queen would reclaim the US.
11,"I'm trying to stoke old fires and incite another war, pipe down, there's money to be made"
12,Some wounds don't heal. It's time for another war just for good measure. It's time for the rest of the royals!
13,This.
14,"There is a list of 27 grievances with the actions and decisions of **King George** in our [Declaration of Independence.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievances_of_the_United_States_Declaration_of_Independence#:~:text=30%20External%20links-,Grievance%201,sent%20to%20the%20British%20Parliament.)

Maybe it was sent to British Parliament but the grievances were over the monarchy's actions.

I'm not a historical scholar, I don't know every fine detail, but I have taken history classes in college specifically about the American Revolution and I've never heard your version before. I'm not saying I'm definitely correct but I've never heard of Parliament being the real issue and not the monarchy."
15,Unreal! Some water can't go under the bridge!
16,I can't see how!
17,She has been a steadier and better influence in the world than just about any president at least since the 60s
18,Weeping the death of any of the 1% is weak sauce but weeping the death of a monarch is downright cringe.
19,Oh come on if you are going to incite a war go with one that’s already begging to be sparked.
20,"That was the “Fuck the King,  we can make a better one” after the king said “Fuck you peasants,  obey your betters”. 


George Washington,  and the American Regulars were King’s Men Red Coats for a hell of a lot longer than they were rebels.  


I mean some ,like Jefferson were done with the King before it all kicked off.    And others , Adams, were loyal to the king until the Boston crack downs.    Many, if not most, were pretty loyal until the King was clear about his position of their grievances"
21,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition_to_the_King 


Basically,  we will stay with the King,  not the Parliament.   We especially hate the former and current Prime Minsters and their minions."
22,"My bro, what did Britain do to you?"
23,nah it's just because she was there for so long and the menes etc.
24,She was a monarch doe
25,"What says I'm weeping? And even if I was, just because you say it's cringe doesn't make it so. Get off your high horse, people are allowed to feel however they want about this."
26,🇺🇲 Revolutionary War 2.0 babaaaayyy 🇺🇲
27,"**[Petition to the King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition_to_the_King)** 
 
 >The Petition to the King was a petition sent to King George III by the First Continental Congress in 1774, calling for repeal of the Intolerable Acts.

28,A fair question.
29,"I didn't say you were weeping, I just said it's weak and cringe to weep over a billionaire or a monarch. And obviously, opining about anything doesn't make it a reality. I said it's cringe cause it makes me cringe. Where do people get this idea that calling something cringe means they think it's an indisputable fact?"
30,"So you said your opinion doesn't mean fact, so why are continuously telling people that it's weak or cringe as if they should feel that way? It makes you cringe, so you have to insistently tell that to everyone? 

I'm not even a royalist, in fact id say I'm more in favour of no royal family than having one. But I can still understand that others believe differently and let them feel as they please because it's completely harmless.

It's like telling someone ""oh you like films? I think films are boring and pointless"" and then in the same sentence saying ""just because I said that doesn't make its fact"" 

So why say it then? Do you think your point of view is more superior to anyone else and you just have to let them know?"
31,Why does anyone express their point of view?
