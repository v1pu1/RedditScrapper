7,"Liz Truss is the new PM (in the pic). Not sure why it's cringe, maybe because of the previous scandal within the Tory government that led to Boris getting kicked out and yet another unelected Tory PM as the leader. (Theresa May, Boris Johnson (until he was elected), and now Liz Truss).

But yeah, this meme doesn't make a tonne of sense really. It could just as well be argued she finally saw Boris out and could rest after that"
