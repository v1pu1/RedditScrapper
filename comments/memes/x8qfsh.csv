14,"A great piece of advice I heard once is, ""don't listen to your doubts after 9pm."" You're tired around bedtime, so it's likely you're not thinking rationally. Obviously, not everyone goes to bed around that time, so it's more like ""don't listen to your thoughts before bedtime."" If you're looking back on all those moments, just remind yourself that you're tired and being left with your thoughts, and you can deal with life again in the morning, but not right now."
