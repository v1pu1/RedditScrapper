If someone refuses to accept they can be evil they are never moral. They are never choosing to be good rather than give in to their shadow self- they are just acting, just doing the only thing they can do. People who understand their shadow self and chose to be good are making the ethical choice not to be evil. This choice is what makes them morally right.

These influx of memed “bad” bits is to make Brits ashamed of their country’s past is actually more a reflection of those still feeling oppressed by historical events. Germany has demonstrated, teaching children to interrogate difficult histories does not make them hate their country. It can serve, instead, to promote an “anti-nationalist nationalism”, in which the very tenets of nationalist thinking – including viewing the past in nationalistic terms – are critiqued."
