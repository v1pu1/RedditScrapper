0,"""You can also borrow money from us then pay back soon at a higher price"""
1,"""Nice try mom! I know that's you in disguise!"""
2,Well actually it started with gold. People wanted to store gold at a goldsmith (cause gold is kinda big and awkward) and the goldsmith would give them documentation of the gold stored which they’d often go and trade with instead of the gold itself. After a while the goldsmiths realised they could give “loans” by issuing documentation without being given gold to store first.
3,No no no no listen listen no no no no listen
4,"I heard that banking started as a way to protect religious pilgrims when travelling to somewhere… i forget where, but they had to travel a long way and part of it was through a pass that was notorious for robbers. They would be given a document to collect their money from a member of the ‘bank’ group once they reached their destination, minus a fee a guess. I have a feeling it was Jerusalem?"
5,And then charge me $7 a month because i dont deposit more than $1000 a month
6,No for real just hand it over. And then every time you ask for some back I'll just charge you a little fee. This makes sense. I promise.
7,Where’s the guy who invented 5 thousand words  to confuse the unintelligent people like me
8,"Fun fact: people used to intentionally be late on loan payments. Paying your loans on time meant that the bank didn’t make any money which would reduce your reputation within the banking community (I guess it’s a primitive credit score), anyways if you paid your loans on time the banks would ban you from making loans"
9,How else do you keep your bed soft if you take all the money out and stick it in some machine ex machina bullcaca
10,People tend to forget that the only reason they aren't being robbed now is because people assume their money is in a bank.
11,ok rockefeller/Rothschild
12,"Ok, I’ve not heard much about this before. So can anyone please explain how the bank is a scam?"
13,"Robbers when bank was invented:

""Is for me?"""
14,"IIRC the first implementation of the modern banking system was actually the Christian church, specifically the knights Templar! As they allowed the exchange of currency and assets to be picked up or traded after traveling"
15,"We will take your money but give you more back. 

That sounds like a scam at first."
16,Wasn't it the Medici family who invented the banking system?
17,I'm insane same time
18,Is the meme guy samwell tarly from GOT?
19,To be fair also it was useful back than since it was a lot harder to move larger sums and it was more common to get robbed
20,The first banks were insurance scams.
21,IBAI explicando es el mejor meme
22,So they can risk your money to make more and only hold/let you take back out a certain amount at once
23,More like tax collecting
24,So true
25,"It’s weird when I thought of it a few days ago

You essentially loan your money to a bank for them to make a fuck ton of money on which wouldn’t be a problem. Except they give you Pennies on their hundreds"
26,You can take out as much money as you want no risk
27,Someone doesn't know how banking was invented
28,one name: Rothschild
29,some banks accept baby batter too.
30,Businesses: Okay
31,No Jimmy this is your dad. Now give me some beer money or I'll smack ya!
32,r/beatmetoit
33,But I’ll buy you berries :(
34,But lending predates storing gold. Technically lending existed before gold was even mined
35,"Stop with real history, this Is reddit"
36,Wait. So the loan system is literally built off giving people money that never existed. No wonder the economies around the world go through periods of collapse. Its got imaginary foundations. How did it not breakdown the first time someone found out the goldsmith lied about the amount of gold in his documentation?
37,"Isn’t that what Flying Money was from hundreds of years ago? You effectively have a credit and when you make a purchase, you lose some of that credit"
38,Okay Bumble advertising
39,The Templars got insanely powerful because of their banking system.
40,Jerusalem huh?
41,What sort of bank are you with?
42,"Given that initially, a ""bank"" was a goldsmith renting you a little space in his vault, yeah, it does."
43,That is incredibly stupid. Surely this is not allowed now?
44,Some assumptions have been made by you
45,"Robbers before banks were invented:

""your stuff is my stuff now""

people: 

""dang okay"""
46,But you do get more back. You get interest which then means you get a small bit of money for putting your money in the bank. What’s wrong with that?
47,"The Catholic Church was doing it earlier.  They didn’t call it banking, obviously, but they took cash on deposit, made loans and charged interest like a bank.  

The concept is probably even older, but it’s not a facet of history I’ve spent a lot of time studying."
48,And someone also doesn't know that humour already invented
49,*Property speculation intensifies*
50,"Wait, you're alive!? Other dads just left to get the milk but you faked your own death!? You did a good job honestly."
51,And I'll never see that money again.
52,"Lending doesn’t make you a bank.

Taking possession of people’s money and using it to lend to other people makes you a bank."
53,Totally. Presumably lending has existed basically since humans understood the concept of personal ownership but lending passed your reserves is something unique to our modern understanding of banks and money. Also caused the first runs on banks/goldsmiths and therefore the need for the first reserve bank.
54,The knights Templar?
55,"I don’t know if that’s correct, I could be remembering wrong. I think it was that part of the world. But I’m willing to be corrected."
56,PNC they have the most atms and bank locations around where i am so i have to use them
57,don't banks have operating costs too?
58,don't banks have operating costs too?
59,"No, the culture has just changed. Now bankers use higher interest rates which forces you to pay more than the initial loan, even if you comply with the minimum payments"
60,"You lose a wallet of cash. You have no recourse.

You lose a credit card/debit card. You cancel card and report it as lost.

This is just one FACT … not assumption."
61,"Indeed it is:

Matthew 25:17

"" Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest."""
62,I mean if you try to be humourous you need to have a funny basis. This is just flat out wrong and therefore there is no basis for the joke.
63,"Nah milk is too mainstream, I like drinking bleach for that extra kick. Now give me the damn money I'm just about had it with ya."
64,"Yeah, they essentially became so rich from inventing their own banking system that the church saw them as a huge threat and culled them"
65,I used to have that problem. See if you can switch to a credit union. They usually don't charge for no deposits and they let you use any banks atm for free. Just give any local one a call and they'll help you choose the right kind of account
66,"Yes, and now they make that up in the difference between interest in loans and interest on deposits. But, at first, they were simply storing your gold for you until you came and got it."
67,Ha. Sure keep going. Try again. Think about it slowly this time though.
68,"""joke isn't funny unless it's based on facts"" erm. No that is literally not true and no one has ever said that."
69,Is it hard to type with that stick up your ass?
70,The point of this format is that its wrong. Its kinda ironic how you educate others on humour yet have no understanding on current popular formats. Not to mention that youre wrong.
71,Dad I don't think you understand *pulls out 1922 luger* I inherited your guns.
72,Go on
73,"I know you think you sound clever with the subtle, hollow quips but um.. you aren't really saying anything lmao.

I'll make sure to come to you if I need advice on burgers or whatever it is you do."
74,Most of the time boring and flat jokes are the ones that have no basis or reference whatsoever. If you try to make fun of something it would be wise to at least know something about the topic.
75,If stupidity (whether on purpose or not) is funny then I guess we have more problems than I thought.
76,Not all of em! *pulls out a water gun* wait shit... JIMMY WAI-
77,Then they hid in remote areas in Scotland and Portugal whilst being hunted by the church. Some say they went on to form groups which would then be adopted by freemasonry (the Masonic order is still called the Knights Templar).
78,"If that's what helps you hold yourself together whenever faced with the need to reevaluate a past statement, go ahead. Make it about me ""trying to sound clever."""
79,"If you were not aware of the fact that intentional stupidity is considered funny, yet decided to lecture others on humour then i guess we have more problems than i thought.

Humour is constantly changing evolving, rediscovering old things, inventing new things. If youre left behind on the trends you can cry about how things arent funny anymore but thats a you-problem."
80,WHERE'S THE GOD DAM MILK OLD MAN!? IVE BEEN EATING MY CEREAL WITH WATER FOR 4 YEARS!
81,"Wait, I didn't know that, I thought they both were two different and separate."
82,You still haven’t said anything lmao
83,"Humour is subjective but for me it is pretty bland and boring to just sat something nonsensical and stupid (either intentionally or not) and call it humour. Humour is finesse and delicate, it fits to the context and build up on established facts and twists and shifts them around. Humour is in my opinion more complex than just ""haha I am stupid, applaud me now please""."
84,Jimmy I can explain! It wasn't me your mom made me do it! It was her all along! She took all the money Jimmy!
85,"There's some debate about how connected they really are, but a lot of the Knights Templar traditions and practices have carried over into the Masonic order of the same name"
86,*Guns you down* my real dad would've screamed louder and would've tried to beat me with his belt.
