0,"No way home was my favorite mcu movie, but to be fair a lot of it is influenced by nostalgia. It’s still definitely worth a watch."
1,"Loki, moon knight, wandavision,  no way home were all fantastic"
2,"Even if you didn’t like the other shows, you gotta admit No Way Home is Amazing!"
3,A captain America that hates America? Yah OP is just someone that thinks any criticism of something means you completely hate it. Falcon’s whole deal is he loves his country and wants it to do better. He plainly said it at the end of his show
4,"I'm not a fan of all of the stuff Marvel has done post Endgame, I didn't even think Endgame was that great either tbh. But I though Loki was really good, and I also really liked Moon Knight, Hawkeye didn't seem as bad as people suggested either and Wandavision was at the very least interesting. 

Not had much interest in Ms Marvel or She Hulk however."
5,"The next movie in the Marvel horror franchise:

The Revenge of Stan Lee"
6,"*Looks at Spiderman, Shang Chi, and a few of the tv shows that AREN'T she hulk*

&#x200B;

Well..."
7,When did captian america hate America? I dont think we watch the same show
8,"What captain America hates America? You mean Steve Rogers, the man who became a fugitive of the law not once, but twice because he disagreed with the government?"
9,"Into the Spider-verse and No Way Home were both pretty highly rated. 

Moon Knight, Wandavision, and Shang-Chi were all pretty damned good, especially for mid-tier heroes."
10,Can this sub not turn into a hating mcu sub?
11,"Thanks Austin, you saved me several hours of mildly entertaining content"
12,"Totally fake, Austin powers would like the twerking she-hulk, he's randy baby"
13,"""Hates"" might be a bit much, ""wishes they did better"" is a bit closer"
14,I honestly feel bad for the haters. I've genuinely enjoyed what they've come out with lately. Guess my standards are low enough for me not to know any better lol
15,Isn’t the she hulk twerking like a post or mid credit scene? I’m not sure I understand the outrage
16,REEEEEEEEE but womyn!!!
17,"I have to say, I thought the She Hulk twerking thing was pretty weird… then I actually watched the show and realized it was just a brief, comical post credits scene that people were blowing way out of proportion. And based on “Captain America who hates America” I’m going to guess that OP is threatened white male anti-woke culture war conservative who if we’re being really honest doesn’t like minority/female representation that goes any further than tokenism."
18,You're incredibly invalidating No Way Home.
19,Lol this isn’t accurate at all lol
20,Captain America hates america? Huh?
21,Loki was awesome.
22,"Oh yeah that's all there is to the MCU after Endgame...no misadventures of a timetraveling Loki, no multiversal shenanigans, the best Spider-man movie ever made DEFINITELY didn't happen...nah you're just missing a twerking green lady and the origins of USAgent."
23,"“Captain America who hates America?”

Sounds like you missed the entire point of the series. Conflicted would’ve made more sense but still had been oversimplifying things"
24,Guess we're just forgetting about Shang-Chi and No Way Home?
25,I wouldn’t say he hates America he’s just a little disappointed
26,"Loki and Moon Knight really caught that feeling Marvel had created with the latest films, suspense, humour and interesting story lines.

 No Way Home was great too. Shang-Chi was also good. Multiverse of Madness was lackluster and expected more multiversal visits, though it had its moments. Eternals was badly fleshed out with two story lines that clashed and made the story convoluted. Ms Marvel is targeted towards a much younger audience, so I can't judge that. Wandavision was interesting. Falcon and Winter Soldier was hilarious but still lacked in some things. She-Hulk exists. Thor Love and Thunder was not great not terrible, but felt familiar because of Taika Waititi. And Hawkeye was also enjoyable with good humour. And Black Widow actually had a different main character, Yelena."
27,"*criticizes laws*

aMuRiCa HaTe"
28,"Honestly bro put your shitty Marvel memes in
r/Marvelmemes"
29,Loki and moon night were good Though
30,"Dumb. Wandavision, loki, no way home, moonnight are all great. And I like Hawkeye and She Hulk."
31,"“Captain America who hates America?”

Since when does criticism = hating? You must also hate Chris Evans‘s captain America"
32,"NWH was the best MCU movie 


But half the characters weren't even mcu."
33,"I mean tbf it would be hard to find a captain America who doesn't hate America, just look how fucked up that shit is."
34,my favorites were probably Moon Knight and What If
35,Thor: Love and Thunder was fine.
36,What about the Loki that's dumb? And the Wanda that's willing to kidnap kids to fill a void in her soul (and maybe writing)? And the fat Captain Soviet Union? Everyone hates communism and we can make fun of him.
37,"Atleast MCU is more rich and becoming more diverse (in terms of Story)


Phase 4 is a setup phase like Phase 1, it will all make sense in near the end of Phase and in Phase 6 but you gotta be patient"
38,"Interesting post. Hmm, I have a hunch.  


\*checks OP's profile\*  


Yup they're a super hardcore redpilled with fucked up ideologies. That checks out."
39,"The last good marvel movie was The Spider-Man movies, but Wandavision was also good"
40,Y'all just hating because it's popular to hate.
41,We need more Austin Powers memes
42,"Moon knight, wandavision, no way home, and Loki just don’t exist then"
43,*Hates America* yea no
44,Sam doesn’t hate America. Sure the racism speech at the end of that series (which was actually good by the way) seemed a little forced but the fact he called out that politician like that is unfathomably based
45,A cap who hates America? That never happened in comics… oh wait it did. With Rogers
46,I mean it was obvious once Disney took over and stan lees ideas ran out it would be trash
47,"The new Spiderman and Thor were good, but the rest weren't

I haven't seen the new Doctor Strange, so I don't know if it's good or not"
48,"No way Home

Moon Knight

Loki

Wandavision

But I guess She-Hulk dancing ruined fifteen years of cinematic universe eh ?"
49,I thought Falcon and the winter soldier was really good
50,Lmao this dude's profile explains this meme perfectly.
51,That captain America comment is gonna alert the horde
52,"The MCU atm is a mixed bag of good and ok, nothing has been really bad yet (except maybe Thor). Atm they just keep setting up stuff and we won't see it pay off until next year."
53,"Its called endgame because that was when the use of the good superheros ended. The next superheroes and stuff are replacements that highly likely won't live up to the standard of the orginal heros, or higher expectation as the new heros. I.e. i have a feeling theres gonna be alot more cringe."
54,"Ooh, lets make this a popular format"
55,"Spider Man no Way Home, Wanda Vision, Moon Knight"
56,No way home is worth watching
57,Loki is arguably the best movie/show in the entire MCU
58,No way home was good
59,And a serial killer scarlet witch
60,Sam Wilson’s Captain America doesn’t hate America. He loves it enough to point out when it’s wrong in hopes that it will correct itself and do better. Just like any good friend who truly cares about you has the strength and character to do.
61,There were 3 Spider-men who fought almost all the villans.
62,"shang chi, no way home, far from home, loki, wandavision, and plenty others"
63,I just don’t have time or the mood to watch it all it’s too much.
64,Welcome to the world of comics. Lots of 6/10 stories and then the occasional world shattering event.
65,Brilliant!! Timeheist to go back and find Mike Myers who was funny!!!
66,"There was still some good movies and shows after  endgame. Like:
Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings, 
 Spiderman: No Way Home, 
 Moon Knight, 
 Wandavision, 
 What If? (Kinda),
 Spiderman: Far From Home, 
Hawkeye (relatively good show),
Loki. 
There are still good movies after endgame, you just gotta watch them"
67,![gif](giphy|3efuhK1gdRGsE)
68,This guy forgot about no way home
69,"No way home
Loki
That's pretty much it
Doctor strange was super mid good but not good enough for a marvel movie"
70,Uhh Captain America hated America after Civil War
71,"it certainly isn't great but its ok, it just feels like phase 4 is a lot of moping around and getting over stuff as well as setting up for the next big arc"
72,Completely forgetting about No Way Home
73,I see this meme as I’m watching the new thore and it’s solid.
74,Spider-Men
75,But I like Moon Knight
76,I mean there is Bipolar-Knight dude. Its good tho
77,She-Hulk is a fun half hour comedy show
78,There was also a schizophrenic who was controlled by a Egyptian God.
79,"For me, it all ended in Infinity War"
80,"I see the MCU as finished with the end of the infinity saga. Everything that comes after I consider as bonus content. Some of it is entertaining, and some of it was meh. Doesn't matter though because the important thing is that the main story was brought to a satisfying conclusion.
It's like long running movie series that get unnecessary sequels. It's your own choice if you want to acknowledge them as canon. Like how I disregard everything that happened after Terminator2 or Toy Story 3."
81,"No Way Home was good, but everything else feels like everyone is just going through the motions. Did Feige leave or something?"
82,But hey! Tobey Maguire came back for a moment
83,Local clown posts cringe
84,"""I wanna see what happens after endgame.""  
""No you won't. You haven't seen, what I have seen."""
85,"Phase 4 has been pretty wack. There were a few good projects, but mostly it has just been mediocre"
86,So friggin true dawg
87,True. Marvel is just going down hill now
88,Most marvel movies were mid to begin with. People just don't want to admit it
89,"Oh and the casual removal of all free will in the universe up until one point after endgame. You know, kind of invalidating all of the choices characters made prior to that point because someone else chose all of that for them. Really good moment right there. Definitely not extremely awful and delivered in the most boring stupid way possible."
90,"Let's face it the only good thing post Endgame was the Spider-Man movies, and those were technically made by Sony, with Marvel's approval of fitting them into the MCU."
91,Rival law firm steals the Hulks blood. Entire team show at court Hulked out.
92,I mean...Spider-Man. Thats pretty much the only worthwhile thing to come out after Endgame.
93,"I haven’t seen anything passed Endgame and really have no interest in seeing anything passed Endgame. 

Endgame just felt like a really good ending for the series for me so I just ended it there."
94,Always bigger can’t go forever
95,This is my own head cannon but after endgame no way home happens at the ‘same’ time as loki and spoilers: towards the end where you can see all the alternatives and loki where the timeline splits are the same thing and the end of loki is the canonical ending to the mcu
96,If it ain't Spidey chances are is gonna be trash.
97,I love Marvel to death I read the comics and grew up with them BUT that being said I think they fell off like hard like realllllyyyy hard. That’s not to say it’s all bad but it’s so oversaturated to where there’s more bad than good.
98,"Pretty sure they're using cringe to pull the wool over the eyes of people about the Leader showing up.

Signs are there."
99,Lol so accurate
100,Yeah they also got rid of falcon and made him into a shity captain America. Also doctor strange is somehow less intelligent and a worse super hero.
