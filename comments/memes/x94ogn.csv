0,"Who the fuck cares which phone brand you prefer? It's your opinion, not mine. If you like iPhones, that's okay. If you like Samsung phones, that's okay too."
1,"Can we all just agree that people don't need to buy a new  1k+ phone every single year...

I remember years ago a good flagship phone was the top of the game for a long time. Now you buy one, a week later you'll see ads for the next one while online there are already leaks from the next next one"
2,I‚Äôve used both. Really couldn‚Äôt care less which is better.
3,"Apple bad Google bad Samsung bad

All companies bad"
4,Nokia  > Both
5,I just want all phones to have the same charger like they could have for the past 10 years
6,For the price ye... wait the samsungs that compete with iphone are overpriced now
7,"I think that both have their ups and downs, but the constant apple vs Samsung people give off major not like other girls vibes"
8,People who argue over smartphones are mouthbreathers
9,"I used both when I can, I personally believe this.

Phone: Android

Tablet iPad

Laptop: Macbook

PC: Windows.

Cause picking sides limits your experience, I always say try before you judge, you might find the other ain't so bad."
10,Stop being insufferable pretentious douchebags and we can stop talking about it
11,Bri'ish plank'on
12,both bad :)
13,both good
14,"Litterally he both doesn‚Äôt matter
Only BIG BIG DIFFERENCE is that Samsung gives people who don‚Äôt have a lot of money a phone as well as people who wanna pay a lot of dabloons a really good phone"
15,The memes change less than the phones every year and these people don‚Äôt see the irony
16,"I like Apple, but only the old versions (I use a hand-me-down iPhone 7 and I love it). The new versions are overpriced and remove the home button, which annoys me."
17,As someone who has to lift/setup and deal with Samsung TVs quite regularly I‚Äôm gonna tell you Samsung can suck my juicy apples
18,It‚Äôs the shitty version of the console wars
19,same argument as other arguments like for example water is not wet or the glass is half empty or tp should be over not under
20,Apple bad samsung bad they are both shit companies
21,Apple bad.
22,Who actually cares what phone you have. This society is just bull shit
23,"If you use an IPhone, that's fine I have no issue. Same with Samsung which I personally prefer. I get it's all about preference but mfs who activity defend apple saying they are lightyears beyond Samsung with no facts or proof are annoying as hell. Same again goes for Samsung users. I'm not choosing sides"
24,"That's never been the argument. Apple is not bad, just overpriced. It preys on the dum-dums."
25,"I like iPhone more whenever I use Android. Likewise, whenever I'm using an iPhone, I like Android more."
26,"‚ÄúHeY gUyS, LeTs ArGuE oVeR wHiCh ChUnK oF pLaSTcK iS bEtTeR fOr EvErYdAy UsE‚Äù"
27,"I see lots of posts about Apple being garbage, but honestly, most comments I've read felt similar about Samsung.

It's the smaller companies that make phones actually worth the money. Samsung is much better than Apple, but still overpriced."
28,doesn't matter what brand you use as long I can watch porn on it
29,"I hated apple and made memes like this. Until I got an iPhone. 

It creates passwords for me and remembers them, AND it shares them between my computer and phone. I‚Äôm a simple man, I don‚Äôt want to remember passwords, that‚Äôs enough for me"
30,U mad
31,"Imo iphone 6 is one of the best in existence, its cheap, usable, has a decent amount of stuff in it without bloat and wont shatter if i drop it"
32,samsung isnt even that good. im using the s10 as it was what i believed to be the best phone when i bought it but when i upgrade im definitly not buying from samsung.
33,I've never owned a smartphone of Either company
34,"Honestly I just like the slightly older models, for example I‚Äôve got an iPhone 7 as a hand me down and it‚Äôs durable and not shit"
35,I'm gonna ask something off topic and that is what episode of SpongeBob is this
36,I‚Äôm a proud 12 Pro Max user. But man the 14 Pro Max excites me as a videographer. So many cool features that I love. The 13 felt like a relaunch of the 12.
37,"Apple is literally anti-consumer, so blatantly, yet people still buy their products on mass.

You will not hear the end of it, because there is willing ignorance out there that needs to be destroyed instead of letting it fester so Apple can continue to capitalize on it.

You're allowed to like things, but not if those things are going to take advantage of you, I won't stand for it. I'm tired of living in a world where you cheat and lie to get ahead, it just creates ruin in the end and the best I can do is write shit like this to combat it."
38,"Both are bad but Samsung makes folding phones and Apple doesn't, so my money goes to them"
39,I'm typing this from a Samsung phone. A10 I believe. This is the worst fucking phone I've ever had. It stutters and crashes so much I need to restart it every few hours or so. I usually stay with the same phone unless it's completely broken (+5 years) but I'm switching to a Xiaomi one after a little more than 11 months because it takes so long to open basic apps like calling and social media that a queen could live twice her lifespan before this being useful. I've had this time where the phone crashed while no app was opened.
40,Both have ridiculous pricing and absolute brainwashy marketing.
41,Both suck
42,"Both suck, they all suck. But Apple is proud of it and that's why I dislike them in particular."
43,"Having used both.

How the fuck is apple still around? And asking more than a folding screen?"
44,GROND
45,- ü§ì
46,Ok how about apple fell off. Is that better?
47,"Its not even an argument
Iphone is the phone that sucks but people get it because its ‚Äúluxury‚Äù"
48,Really? I see 100 samsung bad memes to every 1 apple bad ones.
49,I prefer PC
50,I also hate when people say Apple releases the same phone every year. The exterior looks the same but the stuff inside is upgraded.
51,LG smart fridge supremacy
52,Nokia best
53,"It's whatevet you prefer. I like android alot cuz i've had android devices my whole life. Somethings with apple devices work differently and i struggle with that alot. That being saif, the same thing is also true the other way around for people that had apple devices thier whole life. So there isnt really a ""better"" option. The only thing which could make one better then the other is your personal preference."
54,This discussion is useless. I'm just happy that technology is evolving. I'm happy if Samsung has new cool features and in reverse I'm happy if apple has cool features. Why tf should I care about others. 90 % of them doesn't even see a difference between 60 and 120 Herz how can I convince them that x phone has 1000 points more in a benchmark or the phone has better GPU Performance etc.
55,If apple is called apple why can't i eat it?
56,Phone is phone!!
57,Get the S23 when it comes out then. Go on.
58,"Samsung bad, fairphone good"
59,samsung bad dodgee good
60,Not samsung good. Anyone BUT Apple good. I've seen 30 dollar phones with features that the 14pro max doesn't even have. One notable being USB C. Imagine selling a handheld computations device and not putting a USB port on it.
61,Xiaomi üóøüëç (actually affordable brand for most people with pretty nice quality)
62,IPhone bad Samsung bad. Xiaomi + unlocked bootloader + lineage is good.
63,But but but... iPhone bad
64,Some people choose value for money. Only rich people break it down to preference.
65,Tell that to the 7 billion people
66,"For some(It crowd) it's an activism thing, Apple being litterly Satan itself due to them making it near impossible to repair anything they sell, they refuse to make replacement parts for their products and attack any company that trys to, then they try to sell a replacement the same phone presented as ""new"" for the last 4 years.

If a company cant make a ******* product that dosent break, they should at least let us repair the godawful things. (Edit: oh and 3rd party repair voids your warranty, not that they would have repaired or recovered the device in the first place they typically just send a new one)

TLDR: Apple litterly Satan, Right to Repair good."
67,"Don't know about other manufacturers, but Samsung has some killer deals that make it 100% worth upgrading every year. I pre-ordered their new Z Flip 4 (normally $1000) and traded in my Flip 3 to get $900 off. If I waited 2-3 years to upgrade I'd be lucky to get half that trade-in value."
68,"Exactly, I normally get one every three years at the least not because I want it but because mine can‚Äôt keep up"
69,Based opinion
70,Same here. As long as you can use it to make calls and browse the internet it‚Äôs good regardless of pricing and stuff
71,Except Nokia
72,Gigachad
73,My phone‚Ä¶ broke.
74,Me good
75,Tell that to the greedy assholes at Apple.
76,Nice name
77,This is a very fair assessment! You shouldn‚Äôt limit your options because one might do better than the other in certain aspects.
78,"Not all of us are pretentious douchebags. The last iPhone I had was the 6 plus, I recently upgraded to a 12 pro. Apple can suck it if they think I‚Äôm getting a new phone every year."
79,"Funny, android users always seem far more arrogant in my experience."
80,Ironic
81,about to colonise all of bikini bottom
82,I mean Apple kinda does that with its SE lineup but Samsung‚Äôs been doing it longer and has more options
83,"I like the home button too over Face ID and all that, thats why I got the SE 2 when it came out. Battery life doesn‚Äôt hold up though so I think I might have to make the switch in favor of better battery lol."
84,My 2020SE cost me ¬£300‚Ä¶. Honestly one of the best value for money phones you could buy
85,"Just compare resell prices and you‚Äòll notice that you gonna make a better deal buying an iPhone using it for several years ans resell it, than buying an android phone and using it for the same amount of time.
I bought my iPhone 11 two and a half years ago brand new for 600‚Ç¨ (release price from apple was 699‚Ç¨) and I could easily resell it for more than 300‚Ç¨ today.
Comparable Samsung Galaxy S20 which was released a half year later was 999‚Ç¨ at release date and today I can only get the same 300‚Ç¨ for it. Thats 300‚Ç¨ more depreciation in just two and a half years.
Apart from the fact that I could easily use the iPhone 11 for 3-4 more years (replacing the battery in 1 or 2 years), because it will still get major updates for this period. And after that it will still get security updates. IPhone 6s got major iOS Updates for fucking 7 years. Samsungs S20 will get its third Update to Android 13 and thats it. 
You guys only see the number but no one ever calculates."
86,You are just wrong
87,"Speak for yourself man, as soon as a new product is unveiled my feed is flooded with ‚Äúapple bad steal features haha‚Äù posts lol"
88,"it preys on the rich dum dums, and honestly they aren‚Äôt adding anything new , just improving on what was already there"
89,In apples next keynote they should release a new CEO there wasn‚Äôt a new one in years
90,Uhh....same on androids too? Google has been doing it for some time now ig.
91,No u
92,Which smartphone do you own?
93,Yeah most people like the older models or at least the style of them thats why the SE was so popular
94,"The features announced yesterday are ther in samsung since 3 years. Pixel binning, high mp cameras, etc. Idk much about Videography but photography in samsung flagships is miles more advanced. Samsung also has 8k Videography since 2 and half years.

Not trying to argue or compare or take sides. Since you are a professional, felt like this might be useful for you. Try to do research on latest samsungs for more technical details on advancements which I Don 't understand :)"
95,"Yeah the A series in particular doesn‚Äôt really perform too well, it feels like you have to have a higher end A-series or get the S- or Note- phones."
96,I have never seen a Samsung bad Apple good meme on this subreddit or any meme related subreddit lmao
97,I had my Iphone 7 from 2016- july 2022 and it didnt even have issues the day I traded it in. I find it very hard to believe yours started breaking after 3
98,Then you must not take care of your stuff
99,Guess you were being careless
100,"I find that r/iphone comments are filled with android keyboard warriors always complaining about how apple simps talk shit about their phones, when I've seen next to no apple users doing this. It's really amusing to me."
