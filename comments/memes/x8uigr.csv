27,Did somebody say sauce ?
28,"In case you are really curious:

Most people who are into that are into that if it is about other people. Its probably just the taboo part of it. I mean everyone who is into incest stuff also has a mother.. That logic kinda doesn't make sense. To me incest hentai is fine if the story is good.

My own sister or mother? Absolutely disgusting.

Its not like everyone who likes incest hentai wants to do it in real life. Same goes for loli stuff probably. Otherwise there would be way way more pedophiles around."
29,"One of my classmates in highschool, his mother adopted a girl into the family because her mother was a drug addict. They were both the same age.

He always bragged about all the sex he was getting."
30,"There's something called the Westermarck effect that prevents us getting aroused by people we consider siblings or family. 

Also, we tend to get aroused by exotic or taboo stuff. I remember in my psychology course that some famous psychologist said that the exotic becomes the erotic, or something among the lines.

I'm guessing those are something related."
31,Is this a oneshot? Or is there a sequel?

34,I have a feeling that this is a rick roll
35,"There probably are, its just they are better at hiding. Also, in most places, women can get away with it since a lot of societies still can't see a woman having a relationship with an underage guy as pedophilia"
36,"i give you an advise never trust an redditor with an anime profile picture, unless it is about manga, anime etc."
37,its porn
38,"Yeah what the hell is up with that anyway, now I wanna make a meme on that shit 

It's always overaged guy on underaged girl, nobody ever talks about the vice versa, its the same thing practically"
39,was it a rick roll?
