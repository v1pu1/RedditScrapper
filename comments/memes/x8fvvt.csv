0,i feel like She-Hulk got her powers in control  way to quick considering how long it took Bruce to get his in control
1,"Ignoring plot, Characters, Lines, etc. The CGI is just ass and the fight scenes are boring. Personally not engaging to watch for me. the marvel studio cg people need some sleep or a break or something."
2,*the amount of unnecessary attention she hulk got
3,"People start to get really sick of the MCU in it's current state. I think the unsatisfaction slowly built up and this was the final straw for many. It's not the worst thing Marvel has ever made, but this was the breaking point, all that built up dislike just went unleashed on this show."
4,And rightfully so tbh. She Hulk really just wasn‚Äôt adapted well and the show‚Äôs character depth across is extremely thin. It makes it really hard to connect with any character in the show and just invest in the plot overall.
5,">Was it that bad ?

Nah, I've seen worse from Marvel and like lots of stuff from the comics I want to erase from my memory forever, I really can't feel anything while watching it, not even hate.

It's just a mostly unfunny comedy show, nothing to see here, but I liked the whole Abomination plot while it lasted."
6,"I have seen the first 2 episodes and while I don‚Äôt like the show, I have to say that is not this insane woke ‚Äúwomen are better than men‚Äù product everyone‚Äôs been saying. I thought it was pretty clear how her whole, ‚ÄúI deal with anger way more than you speech‚Äù painted her in the wrong."
7,"Eh, on a scale of 1-5 it was a two with a few funny moments. I'm still hopeful it'll get better, but I fully expect it to dislocate my eyes from eye rolling. Largely I'm sticking around for little tidbits of marvel storylines.

edit: gotta love being downvoted for stating my opinion on a show. Was I downvoted for rating it to high or to low? Or because I hope it gets better?"
8,"I read all the comments about it and then I watched it, it actually seemed pretty ok to me, something that if you watch it or not doesn't change anything. Truly dont know why it gets all this hate."
9,Mate be careful this whole comment place is just nothing but controversial (coming from all sides) so take a rest here before u scroll down even more
10,How does unpopularity equate to weight?
11,Yes
12,"It isn't that bad, but it's still not the best. The whole point of the show is that it is meant to be a law comedy and for some reason, no one likes the fact that marvel is expanding their genres yet those same people complain that all marvel movies and shows are the same. A lot of people think this is a sign that the MCU is going downhill but I disagree with that and just because it's a multibillion franchise doesn't mean it can't have a few misses anyway. I think everyone just set  high expectations for themselves and is expecting infinity war and endgame level quality even though we won't see that ever again until secret wars comes out."
13,"I have watched all 3 episodes so far, I thought the first one was decent beyond that ""anger"" conversation and the second episode set up a pretty solid story line. Then the third episode happened and I am done. It really is as bad as people feared."
14,did you even watch it? It was not anything worthwhile in my opinion‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs getting hate for being poorly written and it‚Äôs just something to make people keep a Disney subscription the cgi and writing made me wanna cancel lmfao ü§£
15,"Honestly if people really hated a show the best thing to do would be to just not talk about it, hate videos are pretty good advertising."
16,Impossible for an MCU fan to just not watch a show they don't like and not say anything about it.
17,The extra hate/ love people are just trying to piss each other off. It's all political.
18,I‚Äôll never understand people trying to downplay legitimate criticism lmao you‚Äôre not big brained for being contrarian or having a mild take.
19,Do people hate she hulk that much?
20,Fuck marvel
21,She hulk is to SJW and Woke and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt watch.
22,"I've been loving it so far. My family watches all the shows together and it has been one of our favorites. Doesn't top Wandavision or Loki, but we will see how the rest of the show turns out."
23,I watched the first two episodes. Most likely won‚Äôt be tuning in for the rest
24,I think everyone was expecting it to be like a serious show and everything like this when in reality even then the comic books she hawk never took herself seriously and that's what setter apart from the Hulk they honestly most of the people that are hating on it have never read the comics
25,[removed]
26,Honestly if people don‚Äôt like a show: don‚Äôt watch it.
27,"It's bad, but no worse than any other bad show. I think Iron fist is way worse"
28,"Now I didn't watch it but is it not normal for a show to have a dip in quality and writing, especially with films as big budgetwise and culturewise as the avengers were? Like if it's total shit I get the hate but if it's just lower quality than multi million dollar movies why the hate?"
29,"It‚Äôs only a third of the way finished, Daredevil is gonna carry the rest of the season for sure"
30,"‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt watched it‚Ä¶ but here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still just woke trash‚Ä¶‚Äù

/s"
31,No it‚Äôs a fun show that‚Äôs actually enjoyable with interesting characters. Hard to give a final verdict before it‚Äôs finished but it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as people are saying.
32,"They advertised it as a silly show with 90s energy and a very casual tone, I feel like they're delivering exactly that and most of the complaints are coming from people taking it way too seriously, it's quite clearly supposed to be a comedy"
33,"im enjoying, doesnt take itself too seriously but not all the humor lands.  personally not a fan of watching a big green woman and some ""rapper twerk"" but hey it is what it is"
34,"Yes, it IS that bad. NOTHING more than a sexist show that a bunch of single, lonely, angry, 40 year old women made. They market this shitshow as a ""comedy"" but, that would be an insult to women since the show reinforces the stariotype that WOMEN ARE NOT FUNNY."
35,"Yes.

A mary sue (*again*)

Shit writing

Shit characters 

It‚Äôs literally just law n court shit, Law and order for super powers

And twerking"
36,Why are all the comments downvoted
37,"Think its more how bad they Butchered the real hulk. So seeing them force she hulk down people's throat with bad cgi and bad writing while being like ""she's the hulk but better"""
38,It‚Äôs pretty good. It‚Äôs not as dark and tortured as the Hulk movies and that makes people hate it for some reason. I get the complaints that she‚Äôs controlling her powers too fast but it‚Äôs also pretty clear Hulk is much more powerful than her so that‚Äôs a fair trade off I think.
39,"Like, a lot of other marvel shows have gotten hate so why is this one getting so much attention? Like are people giving the haters a mega phone or something so they can turn around and say look people are being sexist?"
40,The twerking scene was cringe but other than that is not great not terrible.
41,I like it. I think anything coming out now will garner a lot of hate. Just watch it or don‚Äôt. Form your own opinion and don‚Äôt worry about what others think.
42,Because it‚Äôs trashy.
43,"No, it really wasn't bad at all. It wasn't phenomenal, but it was a solidly good show which I really don't get why so many people hate it."
44,"Yes, it sucks."
45,"I think it's a fun show. I'm entertained, so I'm happy."
46,I personally like seeing women being set back decades
47,"I am tired of this template, the last one is a black hole"
48,"Hey, remember when GROOT, Stan Lee, and Harambe died? Also Steven Spielberg"
49,You mean people actually watched it!?! Lol!!!
50,"She‚Äôs twerking in the 3rd episode, yes"
51,"It's basically a Lifetime movie with early 2000s quality CGI, except not as funny."
52,Too little Hate I think
53,"Based on the comments, it basically solidifies my refusal to enter the MCU full-scale. Like yeah, not everything Marvel's got is gonna be a homerun, but I'm not gonna rummage through everything to find out the gems."
54,It‚Äôs really bad tbh
55,Theres one heavier thing.... Cadiz
56,"She Hulk isn‚Äôt even that bad, I watched the first episode. It‚Äôs not good but I did un ironically laugh at some parts. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm not really a marval fan but I don‚Äôt find it that bad, it‚Äôs literally the Morbius of TV shows"
57,"Don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt have Disney+ nor have the motivation to watch it in other ways so I‚Äôm just gonna explain my point of view. At the start of Marvel we had Ironman and all and great films, looking almost 15 years later and you can see a company squeezing every inch of creativity to make money and that inevitably leads to bad show like I think She-Hulk. Even if I‚Äôm not all against that, I don‚Äôt feel that taking a successful film/character and creating it a female counterpart is right because it‚Äôs not original and oftenly leads to bad shows (like Ocean‚Äôs 8 or the Ghost Buster with girls).

Edit : call me an incel all you want, I‚Äôm just stating my POV"
58,It's as bad show move on. It's like they tried for Deadpool 4th wall breaks mixed with professor hulk bad jokes
59,Heaviest?
60,It was for a reason though.
61,yes
62,It‚Äôs terrible
63,You forgot Your Mother B)
64,Yes
65,How much time you got?
66,Show just bad. That is all
67,"I know you think its bad now


But it's gonna get way worse"
68,Yes
69,wow! for once my mom didn't make the list!!!
70,yes.
71,"It‚Äôs as bad as marvel humor in general, so garbage."
72,Yes
73,It's terrible. I refuse to finish it.
74,"Ah yes, a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù"
75,I still preferring watch Single Female Lawyer
76,Worst marvel tv show so far
77,Yes
78,Yes
79,Yep
80,it was worse
81,"haven't watched it, but from what I've heard on the internet, it's just an unfunny comedy which makes it cringy"
82,"Episode 1 was meh, I liked episode 2, and episode 3 was bad."
83,"Ok but, what's the actual heaviest object?"
84,Yes
85,*cries in Gojira*
86,and well deserved
87,Are you Kevin
88,Yes
89,It's still better then Ironfist
90,It‚Äôs worse than ‚Äúbad‚Äù
91,"I‚Äôm guessing a main issue is that this character is starting off with a show. Not being shown in a movie and getting a spin-off. There‚Äôs no real big stakes that a movie can do to get a character kick started. We have a meh character in a boring and sedimentary setting. They can‚Äôt do much big changes since that would change MCU and you only really want to do that in a movie that you know people will watch. The reason Loki did so well is it was a pre-established characters and was doing big changes, but behind the scenes. Everything happening in Loki is only having small ripples now to not effect the MCU for now so more introductory movies can be made and the plan won‚Äôt be messed up"
92,Bunch of penis‚Äôs
93,"I would not know, I'm boycotting Disney..."
94,"""Hate"""
95,*Ahem* Twerking scene
96,The twerking scene was pretty bad but not that bad overall. Book of Boba Fett was way worse overall.
97,She bulk oot?
98,Theres that word again. Heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there something wrong with the Earth's gravitational pull?
99,"A lot was just critics. It's so dumb to call all of this ""hate"""
100,"Not looking at the rest of the comments because I may watch it to see how shitty it is, but I have seen a meme where she-hulk is twerking for some reason, so already off to a bad start"
