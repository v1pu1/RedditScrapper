0,"I honestly get irritated when friends and family try to get me to care about our own dead celebrities.

Except when they’re Robin Williams.  That still stings a bit actually."
1,"For me as a German, i don't care too. Die me it's totally weird that people fans of this shit. I mean, what have ache done to get all the power? Right, she was born, that's it. Honestly I can't respect country euch have a monarchy."
2,"I told my mother in law last night, after a 20 minute description of this whole fucking thing, that I had ancestors that fought a war a long time ago so that I didn't have to give a shit about this....

I think the patriotism is what shut her up"
3,"That is a completely fair statement to make.  


It is also fair to state that much like me, you are no one special.  Nothing in the grand scheme of things.  And she was the queen of England."
4,If you truly didn’t care then why make a meme?
5,Same
6,Think of it as the same as the roy vs wade shitt. Mist people didnt give a fuckk but there were still memes about it so for some days its gonna be like this unfortunately
7,"I had to check the op’s name to be sure this wasn’t my fiancé making memes about me.

But the Brit’s get the fancy leaders and us Americans get farting old guys in ugly suits"
8,"your ancestors are British, smh"

10,Wait didn't Harry and Megan left the royal family?
11,"As a Canadian, I absolutely don't give a shit what you think."
12,"As Americans we don't acknowledge the ""rule"" of kings or queens, Eurotards stay seething, its the 21st century its kinda sad this shits still a thing"
13,"Yeah back to school shootings, I guess you guys are busy with that..."
14,"In the grander scheme, neither was she."
15,You really need to rethink that statement; to say you are no one special because you didn’t win the birth lottery actually makes me sad.
16,My wife and it made me laugh
17,Free worthless internet points obviously.
18,You are a farting old guy in a ugly suit.
19,"Last time I checked, Boris Johnson wasn’t much of a looker.

Edit: Also, the British royal family doesn’t lead anything.  They’re high-priced figureheads suckling off the British taxpayers’ collective teat."
20,Lol idk why you are downvoted so much. Each country has its vip entertainment. Brits are posh and americans are hillbilly.
21,What are you talking about? Lol
22,"Irish, so all the more reason to not care."
23,"How are you really gonna say ""Look towards your own country that just had another shooting spree"" and then IMMEDIATELY follow it up with ""leave the people that do care to mourn in their way"" and NOT see the irony in your comment?

Nobody likes it when people insult/attack their people. Pretty much everyone understands that. So why do it to others if you don't like it yourself?

I'm just genuinely curious as to how the irony isn't blatantly visible here."
24,"…because we really aren’t. Sure, we may do special things and have special traits but in the vast majority of us lead very boring lives. We most likely won’t change the world in any significant amount, and in the grand scheme of things, we aren’t really special"
25,"Birth lottery or not if are not big deal to have news everywhere about your death ,a queen or king death is far bigger than redditor's death .

One can change the future of the country to good or bad , and the other oh well it's redditor whining .



Btw u.s.a isn't the only country in the world yet you keep spamming your stupid news in memes about your orange former president , and you can't take 2 days of news about the queens death . 

But i guess you only here to farm upvotes ."
26,Nice save
27,"I'm not sure how exactly Britain and America compare, but presidents (especially the American president) are often more expensive than monarchs. At least British taxpayers get some sort of healthcare in return."
28,Boris was American thats why
29,People always just asume everyone was a Brit who came over. I have family all over but none are British
30,British people. ☕️
31,Ireland was part of Britain at the time

33,"It’s even sadder when you think about those in warring countries who’ve live a life constantly in a state of panic and fear and in some cases only live to die shortly after. Unfortunately, they are no more than another casualty :/"
34,There are definatly history makers that break the average though. You can be special if you try things or build a skill.
35,Someone needs a lesson in the history of Anglo-Gaelic relation.
36,How about the other 90% of r/memes in the past few hours? All of them are only making memes of the queen.
37,"I didn’t make a joke out of someone dying. I made a joke that my wife…a lifelong American whose grandparents came from Ireland and *despised* the the British and the monarchy…is more wrapped up in British royal affairs, which if you’re being honest have **ZERO** impact on anything because they’re little more than disgustingly wealthy figureheads, than she is American politics.  

Get your head out of your arse."
38,"Well duh, but thats like 1 in 10,000 that do anything remotely close to making history. Most of us just are normal citizens just trying to make a living do normal jobs and leading normal lives. Chances are, you won’t do anything special. And Im not saying theres anything wrong with that, I’m just saying that most of us aren’t gonna do anything huge."
39,"Nope 

Ireland was part of the United Kingdom 

Meaning all Irish people were British people"
40,Dude needs to tell that to an Irishman and see how far that conversation will go
41,"India was part of the United Kingdom…that means all Indians are actually British?

What an incredibly ignorant statement."
42,"Facts don't care about there feelings 


I don't particularly want to be British but unfortunately until my country leaves the UK I am"
43,"India was never part of the UK it was part of the British empire 

Ireland was a fully integrated part of the UK however with seats in parliament and the like

And until Ireland achieved independence in 1919 yes every Irish person was British 

And unless your ancestors came to America from Ireland after 1919 they weren't Irish they were British people from Ireland 

Sorry you're too stupid to understand that"
