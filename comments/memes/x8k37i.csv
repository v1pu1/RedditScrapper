There is no step 2. Congratulations!"
1,"I have this one good friend who was always alone and lived in the middle of no where. I asked him if he was ok given his solitude and he said ‚ÄúDude, I just really love being alone. I love it! I don‚Äôt want anyone around. I like seeing my friends and talking on the phone, but only in small doses. Other than that, bring on the solitude!‚Äù I said ‚ÄúGood for you man, I just wanted to make sure you‚Äôre happy.‚Äù And he said ‚ÄúSo happy! I set my life up like this on purpose.‚Äù"
2,"Calling someone who doesn't want a gf an incel is wrong. Incels are involuntary, this guy literally volunteered, what a chad."
3,"""I don't want a GF"" isn't incel talk.

""I can't get a GF and it's because women are lying whores"" ...that's more like it."
4,Seeing a relationship as some kind of status symbol is such a highschool thing to do
5,I might be alone but I'm not lonely
6,The obvious solution here is to just get a boyfriend instead
7,Aren‚Äôt incel like reverse of that they think their own sex and romance relationship for doing the bare minimum and they get mad because they don‚Äôt also extreme hateful to women and other men who can get women.
8,"If your relationship entails giving up your money and freedom, you really need a better relationship."
9,"Just wait until you say you don't want kids.

You'll get called everything from a loser to selfish to a complete idiot for preventing the future growth of humanity.

I've heard it all.

Yeah, sorry, just like my free time and money and don't wanna bring another life into this fucked up world."
10,"who needs a gf when you have family

![gif](giphy|xVPosMMzT60Xzv31my)"
11,"Just keep in mind that no matter what, if someone wants to insult you, they will. There is no making yourself uninsultable. I like to use video games for an example of this.


If you play a lot and are good, you're a sweaty nerd. Play a lot and are bad, you're a loser with no life. Play a little and are good, cheating loser. Play a little and are bad, trash noob. There's an insult for every different combination of things. There's no golden in between where people won't attack it. Once you realize this and apply it to insults, maybe you can recognize that you have worth and the insults are just attacks that hold no merit."
12,Aromantic moment
13,I just like spending time with me more than the rest of you.
14,"This is something I've never heard of until now.

But also it comes off weird to think people in relationships don't enjoy ""freedom"" and ""money"" like you're automatically gotta not have freedom and have to spend all your money on someone."
15,There's a difference between not wanting a girlfriend and blaming God for not making girls like them.
16,"Be real dude nobody is mad that someone wants to be single, they have an issue when someone starts bitching about how awful women are and how women to blame for their loneliness

Which is by definition incel behavior"
17,imagine making up fake arguments just so you can win them
18,People confuse single with celibate.
19,Imagine being so sad that you hate on people for not liking anyone.
20,I care about myself so little that I need someone else to put my energy into cuz I‚Äôm fine with nothing I don‚Äôt care about much but I do enjoy seeing others happy.
21,Being single and wanting to remain single isn't what makes a person an incel though
22,"I was depressed for many years and unable to maintain a relationship for long. Eventually I gave up on dating because I didn't think I could properly love someone if I didn't love myself. In my late 30s I finally came out of the depression and have been more accepting of who I am, and I realized that I don't need someone else to feel complete. Frankly, intertwining my life with someone else's sounds like a pain in the ass at this point, and I'd rather not deal with it. Cats are way less complicated companions than people anyway."
23,"If I‚Äôm being completely real, I‚Äôm finally enjoying myself. I was married for 6 years and it took two full years after my divorce to finally be okay being single. Then I got a gf, and though I‚Äôve enjoyed it, I honestly feel like something is off. Being single is incredibly enjoyable since I‚Äôm able to spend my money how I want, travel when I want (having unlimited PTO helps with that too), play video games, watch tv, get into anime since nobody is shaming me about it anymore, etc.  

I feel awful because I really like my gf, but I‚Äôm thinking I need to end it for no reason other than I think I‚Äôd just rather be single."
24,"""I want to keep my freedom and money"" What the hell kinda girlfriends are you guys getting?"
25,"Incel = involuntarily celibate

If you *want* to be single, you are *by literal definition* not an incel."
26,Ive been this dude my whole life. Relationships just seem like a massive hassle i want no part of.
27,Good choice mate.
28,Only incels call people who are happy alone incelsüñ§ good luck king
29,"I mean...ace people say that all the time and people hardly ever care(unless the person is a public figure and not conveniently attractive). It's the reasoning behind wanting to stay single that can make one be read as incel like.

It's like men's rights(no, I'm not going to acknowledge nutcases who don't consider abuse against males true abuse, they're deranged fringe people who'd probably be deemed insane irl)."
30,I am slightly concerned that your idea of a relationship means not having freedom or money
31,If you think a relationship is losing your freedom you're doing it wrong
32,Don‚Äôt want to and can‚Äôt get a gf anyway lol
33,"I just am not attracted to most people in my town. Has nothing to do with the- actually scratch that, the people in Bumblefuck, Illinois are crazy AF and I don't wanna be anywhere near that romantically."
34,"Honestly, hating on someone for not wanting to be in a relationship right now/evermore makes no sense to me.

If someone chooses to be single for any reason, who are you to judge?"
35,Everytime I tell people I don't really care to try and date rn they try to convince me that I'm aromantic but in reality I just already got enough shit going on right now that I can't fit a relationship into my life
36,![gif](giphy|gFwZfXIqD0eNW)
37,Yeah uh there is a rumor that my girlfriend is jerking her dad and way more. So I'm rethinking.
38,"If anyone thinks you're an incel or weird or whatever the fuck cause you have different opinions and goals than what society states.. then I think it's time to dig deep for any kind of fuck to give

Be yourself, who cares what others think, tell them to stfu"
39,"I definitely have more money for living with my partner, am happier, and take better care of myself than if I was single. BUT! Being in a bad relationship is sooo much worse than being single. If the right person comes along, send it. Don't settle."
40,"Hi. Married dude here. The IN in incel means involuntary. If you don't want a relationship, great! Relationships don't define you and they never should."
41,"incel literally stands for ""involuntary celibate"" staying single on purpose is definitely not that"
42,"Aromantic people,RISE."
43,"I don't want boys, don't want girls, don't want anyone for that matter. Just gimme a deep emotional connection to someone in a platonic way, I wanna know how it feels"
44,"I wanna stay single, I don't want a GF"
45,"Also, like, asexual and aromantic, and both, and many more aspec people exist, btw."
46,"It also works the other way around





 People who want to get married and have a stable life are judged by single people who want everyone to be alone and living life at parties"
47,"I've had my trust broken twice, which is 2 more times than I wanted. No, thanks."
48,"If you don‚Äôt want a gf that‚Äôs fine by me, but claiming all your free time and money gets sucked up by it seems dangerously close to incel speak‚Ä¶. seems like some pretty hard cope. Now children, children suck up all your free time and money. That can come out of having a gf. But the gf by itself? Nah"
49,Imagine making up scenarios to get mad at.
50,"""I want a girlfriend, but I also want to set standards for myself and make sure I don't date a woman who is abusive or manipulative""

""wow what a loser"""
51,I just want someone to cuddle and watch bad movies with
52,The best choice I‚Äôve made in life is to not take advice/criticism from people who I don‚Äôt want to be like/don‚Äôt respect
53,I wish I could enjoy my youth again.
54,"I mean, my wife is the breadwinner of the household, so looking at it monetarily, that's a great ROI for me. 

As for freedom? I can go wherever I want and do whatever I want. I just so happen to like going places and being with my wife. 

So your argument is kinda moot."
55,"I might be a lonely girl, but I‚Äôm happy about that"
56,You are only an incel if you actively complain about being single imo
57,Don't date.  Die silently and alone.  Make sure you save all that money.
58,"Yeah, been single for over 3 years and honestly it's great.

Plus Facebook dating is free and all you gotta do is ask.
You don't need a girlfriend for sex."
59,"Somewhat ironically, the people who berate people that don't want to get in relationships as ""losers"" and ""incels"" turn out to be the real incels."
60,"To each their own.

But while we're on the topic of incels, if all the women are rejecting you it might just be you.

Take a shower. Hit the gym. Buy some nice clothes and get a nice haircut. Even if you have long hair you can style it."
61,"Ngl if one of your argument for not wanting a partner is money, then you are an incel loser."
62,"You're supposed to pool effort and money together with a partner, which leads to both of you having less bills to pay and more free time as you take turns cooking and taking care of everyday chores.

This can be also achieved with a roommate, but if you want to add intimacy into the mix, it's probably better to get either a bang maid or a girlboyfriend. You could also bang a roommate too."
63,Single and ready for a sword fight. En guard!!!!
64,yeah I want to stay single 4 ever I don‚Äôt need a BF - saves me money and time you know how it goes
65,r/terriblefacebookmemes
66,See you on r/terriblefacebookmemes
67,![gif](giphy|3ofT5PzgI9FSn8vPaw)
68,I mean if you think having a gf obstructs your freedom you probably shouldn't be in a relationship. Sounds miserable for her if you think of another that way
69,"Im single by choice, just not my choice."
70,"Why would someone who isn‚Äôt single not enjoy their freedom and money? In a healthy relationship you‚Äôd still have those.

Not wanting a relationship is valid intrinsically. People shouldn‚Äôt need to justify not wanting a relationship."
71,"This was me before I met this one girl a month ago. If you find the right person you don‚Äôt want to be single anymore. Believe me‚Ä¶ (but you need much luck, need the will to meet new people and so on and so on‚Ä¶)"
72,When they‚Äôre really mad that you didn‚Äôt make the horrible mistake they did.
73,"I‚Äôm certainly not saying you‚Äôre wrong, dating is totally a choice and both options should be respected, but damn is this post exactly the kind of thing someone who *can‚Äôt* get a date would post to justify themself"
74,"This was my Great Uncle, he stayed single for his whole 96 years of living. He didn‚Äôt have any interest in romantic relationships. He lived a good life and died surrounded by his family."
75,"Women and their cheap insults!! Incel, small dick energy and Insecure, those are their biggest go to."
76,Or just being asexual
77,"If you're loosing your money and freedom in a relationship you need to leave it pronto, that's a fucking awful relationship"
78,"Women: I don't need no man. I'm fine on my own.

Society: You're such a strong independent woman. You go girl.



Men: I don't need a woman. I'm perfectly happy on my own.

Society: You're just an incel. What the hell is wrong with you?"
79,"Yeah no. If you are losing money then you‚Äôre probably maybe not with the right person, idk. But someone who really just appreciates the thoughts and love would probably be upset that you‚Äôre spending so much than you should and would rather you save your money for the future and yourself"
80,I want a GF because I'm lonely and hate my life
81,"I wish I had stayed single and focused on myself growth and education at a younger age. Definitely a learning experience, wish I‚Äôd have done that for myself. Don‚Äôt give any thought to anyone‚Äôs bs opinions."
82,"Or if they don‚Äôt want sex, they might stay single for that reason."
83,"A relationship doesn‚Äôt mean you lose freedom or money‚Ä¶you just find someone to share your freedom and time with. 

Sounds like you are trying to date gold diggers and not people who are serious about a relationship"
84,Same here bro
85,How did this meme get 6k upvotes? Its extremely poorly executed.
86,"If you WANT that, go for it. If you actually WANT a relationship, but you hate women and don‚Äôt know how to treat others decently, another story"
87,"üíØüíØüíØ

Like why you care ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Do you fam."
88,Pretty sure it's not the choosing to be single but the twisted hatred and rhetoric which is why people look down on incels.
89,Dating is a waste of time in my opinion
90,"Sometimes it is best not to have a relationship if your circumstances don‚Äôt allow it. Like myself, I have too many people to take care of that I just don‚Äôt have time to properly invest in a relationship. I want one, but it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to anyone."
91,Same but ppl keep asking me if I think I might be a lesbian lmao
92,[deleted]
93,find a girl who dosnt take your freedom and money?
94,"I mean the dating game in 2022 is fucked and rigged to fail and blow up on you anyway so, best not to play the game anyway. Also seems like no one is interested in dating men in their 20s either so looks like I'll be waiting another 5 years til I'm 30."
95,"If you lose freedom and money while being in a relationship, then you're doing it wrong"
96,"Depends on your reason. If you want to stay single so you can work on yourself, be a better person, and generally just to enjoy yourself on your own, then that's way better than being in a relationship. And I strongly think everyone should do this before rushing into relationships and making bad decisions.

However if you're single because you think all women are gold digging hoes who use men for their own advantage, i.e. you really are misogynistic and have a faulty view of women, then it's wrong, period. Or vice versa, if you say stuff like ""kill all men"" or whatever. But I'm not complaining, at least those kinds of people can't hurt anyone as much if they stay single haha"
97,"No one should have to have a romantic/sexual partner if they don't want to but like...there are partners who will let you enjoy your freedom AND money.  Avoiding intimate relationships due to this alone seems like a bad idea.  

But you do you!  Just sounds kinda MGTOW-Y"
98,Virginity is cool!!
99,"If you think being in a relationship means having no freedom or money then it's safe to say you've never been in a relationship, or you've never been in a good one..."
100,As a married man with no children I agree with the sentiment of this meme. I could be happier alone. Maybe. Probably
