0,Bruh its september
1,I can't have a gf. My wife won't let me.
2,"I mean keep making this meme every year and it will eventually happen, it's basically just a matter of time before you get one. If an ugly fuck like me got a girlfriend, then surely you can too, trust me."
3,The fact that the original version of that meme was presumably made in late 2014 makes me wonder how old the wojaks are
4,2023 was the year for me
5,I night as well be my own gf
6,"To be honest I also felt this way and then 2019 got into a horrible relationship after which I was ""greatfull"" to be single but really just very lonely and then 2021 I finally found the woman I can call the one and I'm happily engaged. Keep on trying bros and even praying it's worth it in the end . Never give up there will be someone that loves you ,but also learn to love yourself."
7,I‚Äôm on the way there bois :‚Äô)
8,Oof
9,This inspires only doubt.
10,I got a gf this year
11,"Guys, gfs are cool but not first need. I had several, but still felt unhappy a lot.

Gf can't make you happy, even the coolest one. You should make happy youself, by youself. Then it's just a matter of time when you find a girl to share your happiness with.

And yes, it's true gender-inverted as well. For lgbt as well. No partner makes you happy, even if they are motivated and try as hell."
12,"No other person will make you happy if you not happy by yourself in the first place. No other person can ""heal"" you or will fill some gap. Keep on going your way, learn stuff, get education, do sports or just take a walk everyday, make money, get your life together and a girl will be on your side in no time. I was an introvert loner with glasses, lazy, talking to other people: no way and full of problems when i was younger and i also did it so you can do it too. Wish you the best bro."
13,(!dafuq!?boom reference) who needs it anyway ?
14,I gave up on getting a gf so i got a bf instead
15,"I‚Äôll check back in 2040, I‚Äôm sure this image will still be going."
