61,"I played Minecraft with my friends on a $250 Chromebook for a good while, and I still kicked most of their asses in pvp. I had optifine and never got more than 40fps, during combat it'd regularly drop to 10-ish. Your fps drop didn't kill you, you killed you."
62,"The blessing of enjoying games at low graphics and 20fps mann. Now I have a decent 3070 laptop but no time whatsoever to play, and when I can I'm pretty tired so I don't. Well, I play War Thunder sometimes, it just turns the static white noise in my head into rage lmao"

Potato: Thanks......I'm happy to have met someone like you............**catches fire, fan stops, screen fades**

Guy: What... have I done?"
78,"I feel this one, ive been running vr and almost every other newer game with low fps, but its better to think that you can play it rather than why it wont run better"
79,"My favorite game is _Speedy Eggbert_, which is from 1998 and doesn‚Äôt go any higher than 20 FPS."
80,"Bruh, I'm playing elden ring at around 25-35 fps with my low ass pc and I still having fun with the game even at 56 hours and Im on my way to beat Rykards ass."

88,Stardew valley ftw

(This is actually true, I play ToF on 9-12 FPS)"
