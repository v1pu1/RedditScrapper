0,"This is the 100th repost of this meme, but since the 14 got shown...

""I'll allow it."""
1,I use Nokia.
2,"what is this ""new"" feature?"
3,"Me looking at this meme:

I think I've seen this one before.

OP:

What do you mean you've seen it? It's brand new!"
4,"Except that ""dynamic island"" feature though, that's honestly a pretty cool way to use and hide a punch hole setup on the screen

Don't use iPhones at all but that's pretty neat thing I've seen on a phone

Edit: and as others have said (which reminded me) the satellite feature is also very cool and useful aswell"
5,"I really donâ€™t care for all of these features, some people like apple and happy with it, some like android and happy with it. Just choose whatever you want and enjoy it."
6,"Lol, imagine not seeing your battery percentage"
7,what did apple add
8,Apple is just overpriced bullshit.
9,"I tried switching to the best samsung a few years ago. It was weird and glitchy right out of the box. I hated it. I returned it and got an iphone 8. Still have it, works great. I cant think of  anything I need. The better/wide angle camera might be nice for my work but thats about it."
10,Had it for years: Yet Apple does it better. Weird.
11,It's an old meme but still true to this day. People who just use I-phones always get so hyped only to find out it's some feature I have had for years on my Samsung ðŸ˜…
12,yeah its bigger
13,Repost.... Wait this is a different one?
14,"Iâ€™m you, but better."
15,Omg people. Drop this stupid crap already and do what I do and just have BOTH.
16,this is gonna start another phone war ðŸ’€
17,"I always like Apple for their products but damn they took it way too far this time. The iPhone 14 is just iPhone 13 branded with a 14, if you gave me both of them I canâ€™t even tell the difference. No chip changes, no major camera upgrades, no 120 fps, this is just a blatant money grab/marketing scheme for the pro."
18,That kid looks like the biggest douch bag ever lmao
19,"These memes are so forced: iPhone 14 has ONE proper new feature: satellite capable antenna.

The whole debate is about 4 years as irrelevant, please stop"
20,This meme would fit for every apple phone release for 10 years
21,Itâ€™s always the Android users making a fuss every time apple does something. They talk about how apple users act superior with their overpriced same phones but donâ€™t realize that they are acting superior themselves.
22,This meme gets posted everytime a new iPhone drops lol
23,Green bubble=poor
24,Wait until iPhone let you call people. /s
25,>Android users after getting the newest android update 2 years after its release
26,Chad
27,"at the start I was Samsung, then Nokia and now Samsung again"
28,lol
29,it can also use gyroscopes and barometers to tell if you have been in a car crash.
30,Satellite emergency feature is new and extremely helpful for anyone who goes on actual hikes
31,"true. credit where credit is due, their animations and smooth os are something else."
32,"This is some cope. 

Apple puts giant hole in the middle of the screen and y'all tell yourselves it's super cool. 

Hilarious!"
33,It's literally what's been on Android phones for years lol
34,"Huawei phones allowoes satellite texting, so even the ""SOS"" feature is neither new or better than what others did."
35,No because that's logical and my opinion is the only right one >:(
36,"""It's a feature, one long call and it auto shuts off. Now you get to live in the moment. Apple, because get gud"""
37,"Always on screen, different notch better camera and that is basically it"
38,Correct
39,"But the android flagships arent huh? Snapdragon, Sony camera, Samsung screen. I know, Xiaomi is the real shit"
40,"I had a S10. Was a good phone, but was constantly  overheating around the bixby button, even when I the screen was off. I returned it, exchanged it for a P30 Pro. It was actually a great phone for a year, then the usual androin symptoms started to show. I donâ€™t want to do a software maintenance evey 6-12 months, to keep the OS usable, so Apple it is."
41,Like what?
42,">Apple puts giant hole in the middle of the screen and y'all tell yourselves it's super cool. 

Fun fact: keeping the notch actually increases the cost of making the phone and subsequently increases the price. So it goes much deeper than that. They created a big hole in the middle of your screen so as to not appear ""antiquated"" at the cost of your money and then want even more of your money when they fixed the problem they created and expect all the edgy apple fan boys to drool over it.

And they are! Lol"
43,"Apple is never the first to implement a new feature, far from it. But what they are good at is waiting to do something until by they know they can do it right. Weâ€™ve seen this with swipe-based keyboards and widgets on iPhone, Appleâ€™s implementation being more cohesive and easier to use for both cases. It is going to happen again with the hole-punch/pill. No other manufacturer has made the hole-punch layout work this well with the software, it is something only Apple can do. I feel the wait was well worth it."
44,"I've never seen something like this on an android phone before

I know you can hide the punch hole with settings for apps and such but it's not that interactive like it seems with apples implementation."
45,"It is weird though that people are happy with an objectively worse yet more expensive device, just because it has a little picture of an apple on it."
46,"""that'll be $1,400 and your left nut"""
47,AoS has been a thing since the s7 edge days istg
48,Gimbal-like stabilization mode
49,"I agree with you. Apple at least is $799 a nice feel and no lag when you touch it. 

That said, Google pixel is underrated. $300 for their new 6a"
50,"Whatever Android/Samsung sells, Apple sells at like, 10x the price. Overpriced bullshit."
51,"How dare they implement a cool design wich people happily pay for, just like basically all other manufacturers.

All phones should look the same!

/s"
52,"in a year or 2, most new smartphones will be doing the same thing"
53,Other phones only have a very small camera hole instead of a giant pill. And that's even at the centre of the screen
54,"Other manufacturers are making the hole punch non existent.... 


Some serious apple fan boy cope. LoL"
55,"You must not pay attention then, Android it's always been at the bottom of the screen by default"
56,"Well, some people just likes how iphones look and feel. Also makes it easier when basically everyone you know has an iphone, especially in your own family. Each to their own"
57,"Yeah, i agree. personally I hate apple tbh"
58,"I would agree with some of theirâ€¦ strange items on their store. But their phones are honestly a fair price due to the fact that brands like Samsung sell their s series phones for almost a grand. I personally like iPhone only for their mini series. Nothing else.
And if we want to be even more fair, their chips are significantly more power efficient and powerful than most snapdragon chips. But that shit doesnâ€™t matter to most people anyways"
59,You do realize that apples flagship phones are the same price as Samsung ones right? S22 ultra at release date was 1199 and iPhone 14 pro max is 1099. Apple isnâ€™t overpriced my guy
60,"Apple sells at $799. Samsung was like $1100 for their new phone.

That said, Iâ€™m team Google pixel all the way. Their new flagship phone (6a) is $300."
61,"That is correct, but those devices don't offer ""dot-projected"" facial bio-metrics. If they do offer some form of facial bio-metric, it is not going to be nearly as secure as Face ID."
62,"What's been at the bottom? Last I knew there was only 3 things at the bottom... recents, home, and back (and sometimes a button to change the keyboard and hide the keyboard, and when playing games a button to pull up the game optimizer menu and a button to lock the screen)

Got no clue what your talking about. Then again I have my navigation gestures completely hidden on my S21U so nothing pops up at the bottom of my screen at all (had this set on my previous Note 20 and it confused the phone store worker cause the navigation stuff was ""gone"" when they went to check stuff on my previous phone when i went to get my current phone lol)"
63,$1000 bannana holder. Enough said.
64,"This is true as well. Apple does best what they do (kinda) but I meant androids never needed to do this ""Dynamic Island"" type thingy because the hole punch is so small."
65,"and face ID is made completely obsolete and useless by a fingerprint scanner, which is cheaper, more secure, more accurate, faster, and can be more convenient. sure, apple does face ID well, but my $100 pixel 2 has the fingerprint scanner nailed down, and imo its better in every way."
66,"Look up the android OS, they've had every ""new"" feature on the iphone for years, just because you don't know doesn't mean I need to explain it to you lmao"
67,"Oh I know Apple is late to stuff, and calls it ""revolutionary"" everytime they finally stick the features on their phones lol"
68,"Apple is always late with Os features because they developed their own software instead of using android, but their physical phone designs usually set industry trends"
