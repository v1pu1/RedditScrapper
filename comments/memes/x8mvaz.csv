19,My iPhone 6s gave in last year and I got a Pixel 6 pro... Not mutch of an upgrade in therms of the name.
20,i’ll upgrade my iphone 7 to the 13 so i can have a significant upgrade
21,"I'm on iphone 7 and I'm not going to change, until they release a phone that's as slim, small and also with a home button."
22,"If it still works, though.  I had a Galaxy S2 literally until 4.4 wasn't good enough for work."
23,At least you still have a headphone jack
24,"On all fairness, as long as you're not dropping your phone and buy a decent flagship brand, there's really no reason you need to upgrade for multiple generations. 4-5 years seems like a decent time to wait for me."
25,How do you know what I’m doing
26,Reading about it on my Personal Computer with Internet.
27,Such features! Much wow.
28,"I'm still using iPhone XR. I also have AirTags. I can fid them by address, but not by the radio, since it doesn't have that feature. Also I love the new Lidar feature that plots a 3d image of your surroundings. Really would like that feature also. But I doubt I'd be forking out $1800 for a new phone any time soon."
29,POV:The iPhone 14 Pro 128GB in italy costs 1337 dollars(1339 euros)😭😭
30,The whole thing is a scam. The last 5 iPhones have been damn near identical
31,"I,m pretty sure that my 5 year old Samsung phone had those features."

53,I wait every two phones 📱 because they are similar but not similar enough to but the newest
54,The only thing different between iPhone versions is the camera. Everything else is pointless.
55,Here come the android users…
56,Bruh I work in phone sales but I get paid commission for the airtime package. I'm a Samsung person so could not give a flying fuck about apple products and tbh I'm really not bothered by android products. Now I'm just gonna have a lot of ppl asking for specs. Guess I'll just have to tell em we have a website for a reason.
57,the funniest thing is that's the first iphone
58,I thought I was the only that had an iPhone in the single digits
59,such LACK of features
60,Just had my iPhone 12 start seriously slowing down the second the 14 was announced. I really don't think it was a coincidence. I switched to a moto g pure a couple hours ago and prefer it in every way. I will NEVER buy from apple again
61,"Imagine using iphone and feel proud lmao. You can't even jailbreak this now. OS on this is such a pain. Even installing open source apps from outside the shop is limited and overcomplicated, not to mention developing apps to it and trying to have them stay in app store. Ugh i hate apple so much. As a person who wants more than using browser and docs I would never recommend this to anyone"
