0,Lets hope my parents never check the router history
1,"So all the times I went on illegal streaming websites, it wasn‚Äôt completely private? Fuck guess I‚Äôm going to prison"
2,"yes, but literally nobody cares to look.

browse freely, homies."
3,"It's mainly to hide porn from boomer parents who aren't tech savvy.

If you're doing illegal shit the city, state, or feds might be interested in, there is always a way for them to find it."
4,I don't care about my Internet provider knowing I watch octopus hentai porn. It's my wife that worries me
5,I am dousing my router in holy water
6,"The only thing the router and ISP and even the CIA can see is the domain of the site you‚Äôre on, HTTPS completely encrypts all your activity and all the packets sent from the moment they leave your network card."
7,"Wankers lesson #1 

Anonymous window is for keeping YOUR pc clean, not the internet"
8,Wait what
9,That's why gotta use data
10,"Is this true?  

https://youtu.be/awuElqSCefk"
11,stealth -100
12,Pretty sure this is deactivated by default but even if it was activated you could get around it by using a VPN
13,all the kids who didnt know this are shitting bricks rn.
14,POV: The kid password protects the router cause their boomer parents don't know shit and could care less to learn.
15,Don‚Äôt give a shit nobody important will know
16,Yeah but who checks that anyway?
17,Welp guess im fucked if they find out the weird shit i have been watching for the last 5 years
18,"Oh dear god

They boutta see 5 categories of hentai right there"
19,tor üóø
20,It's not gonna stop me from searching big booty Latina in a sexy lingerie
21,Op giving anxiety to everyone here lmao
22,"![gif](giphy|CAYVZA5NRb529kKQUc|downsized)

me who uses tor"
23,Me when I was 13
24,Just use cellular data
25,Just use mobile data
26,"The guy who uses a vpn

![gif](giphy|CAYVZA5NRb529kKQUc|downsized)"
27,Shit
28,"If you're looking at normal porn and not kiddie porn you have nothing to worry about.  Typing in specific key words like ""Nuke's, kiddie porn, or any other thing else"" that your government is heavily against will flag the internet provider which in turn are supposed to send the information to who ever is in charge of all that.   Which then usually they will watch you and actually pay attention to what you're doing online for quite awhile."
29,Wait what?!
30,As a totally unrelated question: how can i clean my router history?
31,No I just don‚Äôt want my parents to find out I‚Äôm watching porn and/or looking up things vaguely related to sex that I couldn‚Äôt ask them for an answer too
32,Incognito + cellular data = unstoppable
33,I‚Äôd rather not have known that
34,"The trick is to wear it like a badge, I‚Äôve looked at some nasty shit that I‚Äôm not proud of, but I‚Äôll own up to it when the time comes"
35,"What's the point of incognito mode when your internet provider can still see it

I want TRUE incognito mode. Nothing you search is saved anywhere

You want to go down that weird rabbit hole? Well now you can! With true incognito mode nothing you search is saved anywhere

Your internet provider nor the government can see it! Hackers? Don't have to worry! While your in true incognito mode no hacker can access your computer

Viruses wont even work. Nothing you do is a traceable

And better yet
Its free!"
36,Aaand that's where the Reddit app comes in.
37,"Not all routers have the ability to log history. My spectrum router that I get with my internet package does not. The ISP probably has logs though. I doubt they would share those logs with anyone requesting the information due to privacy issues.

But yes, your parents can track your shit even if you use incognito if their router has logging capabilities."
38,Me who has an unlimited data mobile data plan: I have no such weaknesses
39,"Approximately 7 thousand people just found out that their parents could find out they watch porn super easily, and the government has known all along"
40,![gif](giphy|d10dMmzqCYqQ0|downsized)
41,"Wait, no plaese say it isn't treu 
Im fucked"
42,"Gotta check my routers's history so I make sure that my kid isn't getting into the wrong kinks. I don't care if they are into gay, straight, neko, or BDSM porn. But I'll be damned if I share the house with a ""Hairy Pubes"" or ""Farts"" fan!"
43,How about data usage?
44,HEH fools I'm using mobile data üóø
45,No parent even knows how to access it and might be afraid of messing stuff up. I personally never check mine
46,Well I be damn‚Ä¶ guess I hope they like my taste in corn
47,cool
48,bruh i literally just finished watching a video about this
49,I‚Äôm the only one who knows how to check the logs in my family üòé
50,Excuse me?
51,Here‚Äôs the thing. Not a single one of you know that. Do you think your parents do?
52,Who can check router history? How do I remove them? oh noüíÄ
53,Soo how could one remove said history from router?
54,Tor ftw
55,Oh no oh FUCK NO
56,What person do something so evil
57,Fuck
58,That‚Äôs why I use Reddit for porn now
59,Not in Europe
60,Fuck so all the shit I looked up is on my router? I‚Äôm fucked
61,"yes but usually it's not accessible without prior setup. also if anyone wants a free, no signup, fast, hassle free vpn to bypass that (i mainly just use it at school to get around their shitty filter that tries to block spotify), i highly recommend Cloudflare Warp (part of their [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) app). because of it's integration with Cloudflare it also bypasses many of the captcha's that you otherwise have to deal with on a vpn (though unfortunately not google, but if you are signed into an account it doesn't show up anyways)"
62,"I always looked at my dad like he checks it and knows what I‚Äôm looking at, but pretend I don‚Äôt know that I think he knows. He always came home, stood in front of me for no reason while he was checking his phone. If he knew, he sure as hell didn‚Äôt say anything. Just like how I saw him transferring data from hard-drive to hard-drive, and looking at the computer screen, I saw a number of oddly named files in the data transfer.

I always wondered why he needed 3TB worth of hard drives"
63,That's not intirely true. The normal home use router does not log by default.
64,"Jokes on yoi, new simplified routwrs dont offer access"
65,"Oh Oh Oh, fuck.  
How do i clear my router history"
66,My dad has worked in the cyber security field since I was a kid. He saved the logs from our router so I was always on watch.
67,And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt go on pornhub anymore I jerk off to cocomelon now üí™üí™üòàüòàüòàüò§üò§
68,It.. WHAT?!?!
69,Get an onion router
70,"Jokes on you, I use a app"
71,Just to let you guys know - its illegal to pirate/download illegal media not to watch streams of illegal media. Watching the streams is completely fine its downloading/torrenting it thats the problem. The person that is streaming the media on the site is the one doing the illegal action not the one watching it. So do with that information as you please.
72,Reddit on mobile is w wonderful thing.......
73,Use bing
74,Doesn't using a VPN prevent this?
75,"Started using alt reddit and Twitter accounts on the apps when I realized this, or going on to data for web stuff."
76,And how do you access those said logs?
77,Well now I don‚Äôt need to hide anything
78,"I loved it when my IT guy came into my office and told me, ‚ÄúRemember, just because it‚Äôs a wireless connection, doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt track you.‚Äù (No I wasn‚Äôt, and didn‚Äôt, surf anything I shouldn‚Äôt have at that job.)   
Dude was trying to be nice and helpful, and I thought that was cool.  But also, funny as fuck that there are people that didn‚Äôt realize that a wireless connection still meant connecting to corporate hardware."
79,This meme brought to you by children raised by toxic ass parents.
80,Not if u use reddddddddit
81,Oh fuck...
82,Wait really?! Oh no!
83,"Jokes on you, i unchecked the box that logs me entering blocked websites (or any in general)"
84,"Jokes on you, I still use dial-up

UK UK UK!"
85,they what!
86,"Man I don't care, they'll be too busy vomiting to do anything."
87,I'm the tech support for my house so I'm the one with router access:)
88,"This is why I do all my stuff on regular browsing mode. It‚Äôs easier to go back there when you need it again, you know‚Ä¶ since it remembers where you went."
89,"Oh no!

Anyway."
90,VPN with brave private browser with tor
91,That‚Äôs why I turn the WiFi off to lol. I ain‚Äôt dumb
92,"Me: uses vpn and a secure browser and pi hole.

Router, I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
93,my dad needs help to install apps and sometimes click on facebook posts so i think im fine
94,Yes but one cannot simply view the router history
95,Dudes my dad knew on how to do this as a kid. Most annoying shit of my life.
96,Hold on brb gotta check
97,All people scared like when I was it‚Äôs quite difficult to and even if they thought you were wanking they wouldn‚Äôt want to check what your watching unless your mums a Karen
98,Tor+VM+Express VPN+ Tail Linux for pretty much 100% privacy
99,"They....



#WHAT!?!??!?"
100,oh damn
