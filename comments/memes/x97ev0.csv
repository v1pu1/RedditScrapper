Whilst her contribution to the world was enormous, she also had an enormous impact on meme culture as she was a well loved meme icon who was used in many popular meme templates.

A reminder that r/memes will allow memes that honour the death of the Queen, provided that posts are respectful, not ill-natured and do not break any other of the sub's rules. These include no reaction memes, no meta-reddit references, and no reposts."

92,Say what you want about her.  But i have seen a photo where she looked mean or jealous or unregal.   Unlike some other family members.    But you shouldn't really be blaming her for their actions.   Show some respect.
93,"She was given unimaginable power, for absolutely no merit whatsoever, and she at absolute, *absolute* best; completely wasted and squandered it to live a life of impotent luxury. 

And at worst; she actively made the world a worse place, where in her place any decent, feeling human being wouldâ€™ve made positive change. 

She was somewhere between a lazy layabout and a monster. Glad sheâ€™s dead, hope it hurt. Wonâ€™t be one one millionth of the hurt her country caused while she was head of state."
