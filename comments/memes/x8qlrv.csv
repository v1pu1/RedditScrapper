7,"As a former alcoholic, you don't have to be absolutely wasted to lose a shoe. To have it fall off mid-step, maybe, but one of the most common ""weird drunk thoughts"" I had when mildly drunk was that I wanted to get my shoes off. Not really sure why. Normally I don't take off my shoes ever unless I'm at home."
8,I saw lots of downvotes….. So I upvoted

10,"...?  You just proved my point by saying you get intoxicated and want to take your shoes off..  Sincerely, I wish you luck with your recovery."
11,"Heh thanks. I dont really have a problem with downvotes. Its kinda fun how the internet decides to randomly get butthurt over things or dandomly decide to love a thing and you cant quite pinpoint what will get hated or loved.
Imagine how boring reddit would be if everything everyone did always got upvoted. Then the upvotes would mean nothing. ;)"
