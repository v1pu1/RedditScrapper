0,You forgot the most important part... It has a new camera.
1,"Corporate needs you to find the difference between this picture and this picture

*They're the same picture*"
2,I feel like apple are just doing the longest running Americans dumb joke and that is my head canon
3,apple announces you can customize your phone wallpaper: apple drones celebrate like they just won the lottery
4,DYnAMic IsLaNd!!!
5,It even has the same battery!
6,"What do you mean it's the same it now has always on display, a feature that has never been seen before"
7,This is why I have the iPhone 10
8,How many fucking times is this going to be posted and do yâ€™all actually think people are buying a new phone each year???
9,Are people seriously just finding out that Apple does this?
10,"This basically goes for almost every brand

Not a single sane human would purchase a new phone every year, or a new car just because Audi changed the bumper on this facelift a little ..."
11,I canâ€™t even afford an iPhone 8. Been suing a 6 for years now
12,Same as with every galaxy upgrade.  Most the time you have to wait 2-3 versions before you see a significant change with either manufacturer
13,"Hahahahahhs, laughs at you guy with a 100$ Android. With 8mp camera"
14,You're just not cultured enough to be an apple user. Peasant. /s obviously.
15,":00000

No wat really? Thatâ€™s insane

16,Donâ€™t think about year over year improvements. Most people donâ€™t want or need a new phone every year. Think 3-4 years and the differences are a bigger deal. Everyone is just on a different purchase cycle so yearly releases makes a lot of sense.
17,Ffs. It the same dam thing with every smart phone.  Minor improvements every year.
18,I have the 11.  I usually keep phones 2-3 years.  Will probably upgrade nxt time I damage it instead of getting it repaired.
19,"sadly I know people like this.....

atleast he skips the odd numbers i guess"
20,Buy me oneðŸ˜‚ any?!
21,This phone company's can save environment and solve chip shortage by not releasing new phone every f*king year.
22,Wait until you hear about the new cars coming out for 2023!
23,"Companies really arenâ€™t incentivized to do that though, are they? Welcome to capitalism. Hate the game."
24,Well. Now is the age of innovation in electric cars.  There might be some major innovations happening. The redesigned info center(radio) is a major improvement in functionality (does the same thing with 1/2 inch bigger screen).
