0,Kratos was actually had a darker skin tone in the games lore. The ashes if his dead family stuck to him and gave him his iconic look.
1,"And when a black female character was introduced in a new Pokemon game some time back, ""ShE iSnT dArK eNoUgH! tHiS iS wHiTeWaShInG!"""
2,"Yep, every time we talk, their words are just a brick in the wall"
3,Gamer gate really did a number on the youthâ€¦
4,haha nekopara go brrr
5,"Too attractive is not the issue. It was the choice of clothing given to them, or rather lack of clothing. 

That being said, since the largest demographic for videogames is men, its not hard to see why this is the way it is."
6,Never will and never can with these sort of people
7,Never try to please and absolutely never apologise to them.
8,"This anti-woke schtick was relevant in 2015... I think most people are past it, haha. Time to grow up."
9,"Me then watching Darksiders 3: HOLY CRAP FURY IS AWESOME!!!! SHE EVEN HAS AN AWESOME WHIP!!!

a while later

Me:...did she just show despair? My GOD Fury is cool! She is the only female horseman and yet she does fine!

At the end

Me: Wait, so you're telling me that she hated humanity but practically lived because she did all the seven sins? WHEN IS DARKSIDERS 4 WHERE ALL FOUR ARE FIGHTING TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!

Overall, I am kind of a feminist if games are stereotyping women but I usually overlook the looks of them due to their great personality and impact on the game."

11,I think Bayonetta has more active LGBTQ+ fans than active straight fans. Atleast according to polls
12,"Yeah... They went pretty mad about a girl wearing a normal dress, and called racists and pedophiles everyone that defend her, so... Lefties pretty much are mad that their fun isn't funny for everyone else and hate being wrong and having evidence of it"
13,I seen women in real life dress worse than all the girls in the picture. Plus the only one i see any issues with would be bayonetta the others are either wearing dresses or school uniform.
14,"Nah, when woke people still throws a temper tantrum over a girl in a white and green dress, Mario wearing a Sombrero, then means this is more relevant each time someone cries about things like this."
15,I don't think we are pal lmao
16,"Also, the Kusanali controversy was because Twitter Fun Police didn't find her up to their standards"
