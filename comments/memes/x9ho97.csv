8,Ngl I kinda see the guardian as more of a news site that you find on page 2 of google that has a 50/50 chance of being accurate after they posted that one article asking if gamers should be held accountable for in game war crimes

11,"Ok, and? That's not relevant"
12,Obviously you don’t get it so I’m done talking with you
13,Thank god
