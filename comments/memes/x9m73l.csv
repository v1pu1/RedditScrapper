0,This sub hasn't been funny for awhile at this point
1,At least we won't see any more she hulk twerking memes for a while.
2,When was this sub funny?
3,"Newsflash: most of the shit posted here, isn’t funny."
4,"Then leave sub for 2 weeks, ez"
5,Way better than chad ask me memes
6,Bold of you to assume there was anything funny before
7,My dude. You’re on Reddit. When is _ANYTHING_ out here actually funny.
8,"Me knowing damn well that the next century of this subreddit will be filled with reposts everyone has seen at least 42 times and that will not be funny

![gif](giphy|xT0GqgeTVaAdWZD1uw)"
9,I hate everything=karma
10,Yeah just like the she hulk memes
11,So make something funny and post it? This ain't it though... It's literally just the same Queen Elizabeth-centered content you're complaining about.
12,Hey at least we aren’t r/shitposting where they have to say the same few words in the comments or else it gets censored and they are gonna keep these memes for probably double the time
13,What is this meme about?
14,The jokes about King Charles is funny though
15,Facts bro
16,"So, why don't you create something funny?"
17,"My condolences.

I know that this death is hardest on you."
18,What's not funny about queen liz dying?
19,Irony thy name is throwaway59009
20,Have some respect for a day please
21,Ok then used a good meme format rather than this shitty overused breaking bad one?
22,"It's useless to go to Reddit, when everyone is spamming about the dead people"
23,This was funny
24,Just 2 weeks? Good luck
25,Facts.
26,HAHAHAHAHAHA you think this will only last for two weeks?
27,There's 11/9
28,Karma farming goes brrrr
29,I’m glad that people aren’t talking about chat anymore. That meme was only funny for a day.
30,Kid named finger:
31,The best way to complain about Queen Elizabeth memes is to make a meme about Queen Elizabeth
32,"Jokes on you, I'm into that shit."
33,![gif](giphy|9MJ6xrgVR9aEwF8zCJ)
34,This is what non-Americans feel like
35,"No funny, just sad, sad, sad."
36,"1. Humour is subjective.
2. Hasn't even been 24 hours yet and you're already saying queen lizzy is old news.
3. It's reddit where no ones opinion matters, including mine.
4. Don't rely on random strangers to make you happy"
37,"Hey guys so this thing just happened and now my source of internet funny will be polluted with it so to make sure i made my point clear let me make a post about the thing that happened. 

You are the problem here."
38,everything is r/comedycemetery
39,Awhile is an understatement. Been downhill for 2-3 years now.
40,Keep that up and she hulk's gonna twerk on the queens grave.
41,Before her reign.
42,"Not most of, all of the shit posted here isn't funny"
43,Wow have you ever visited reddit.com
44,Well.. That's a brilliant idea
45,r/comedyheaven
46,"I have seen so many reposts that my first instinct is to report, select breaks r/memes rules, no reposts.

The same goes for post ideas that are stolen and put on another template/altered text. The detailed rules do say that unoriginal memes are not allowed either."
47,no lol
48,"You had it throughout the night, your 12h are up"
49,"Yh i mean shes not a queen for fuck sake shes the Queen, let her have her moment."
50,But this post isn't even a meme about her death
51,Happy Cake Day!
52,"Things I hate:
1. Lists
2. Irony
3. Lists
4. Repetition
E. Inconsistency"
53,And r/repost
54,Some people with no sense of humor made that sub and post there.
55,Are you here just to torture yourself?
56,"Or when it is, it is yoinked from another site or person"
57,I love you
58,Thanks mate!!
59,Yes
60,You're welcome
