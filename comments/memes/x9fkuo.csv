0,Why would anyone not want pure hydrogen. Those oxygen bonds are totally overrated.
1,"went down the rabbit hole of H3O, meh, no meme potential"
2,Someone smart explain now!
3,Let's go H20 with H20.
4,So...H2O2?
5,I’m so tired of drinking air
6,Is this like carbonation but hydrogenation?
7,2 hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom make up dihydrogen monoxide aka water.
8,That would be OXYGEN infused water….but I like what you’re doing there
9,needs more nitrogen
10,I hope not tbh lol
11,lol no what does hydrogen infused water mean??
12,"Fuck, chemistry isn't my thing. Meant H30"
13,"Oh hey happy cake day!

That is the only thing that makes sense to me."
14,"I’m thinking it’s like carbonation but they use hydrogen instead of carbon dioxide. So H2+H2O 

I THINK"
15,thank you
16,"In my mind, water is two hydrogen and an oxygen. Infused with hydrogen...just another H"
17,Yeah but hydrogen (and oxygen) are happiest with 2 so H2 and O2 are hydrogen and oxygen in their natural state. There’s a different bond to make H2O (water) and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) as far as I know H3O doesn’t exist.
18,I bet this is literally just regular water they say has hydrogen added to make it sound fancy anyway
19,*shrugs* idk why you’d want extra hydrogen anyways
