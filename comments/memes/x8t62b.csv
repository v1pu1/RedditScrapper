0,"This is actually relatable because:
Once i had dream where there was a meteor strike at my area and a meteor strike my house killing my mother, brother and wife<imaginary>.... I suddenly wake up and spend 10 minutes telling myself that it wasn't real, just a dream and bringing down my heartbeat from 120 to 80 bom curbing a panic attack....."
1,"I once had a dream where I was in my moms bed, but not sleeping, I was awake and thr hallway on the left top of the wall was dark, suddenly, 2 dark shadowy figures entered the room, I tried to wake up, but it failed, I forgot what happened then. 

fun thing: I was once dreaming I was in school, going to a exam, I was very anxious, but then, I remembered that ""wait a fucking second it's the holidays not thr fucking exam week"" and then i woke up"
2,Me being extra nice to my mom/dad after having a dream about them dying and realising that I'm not emotionally equipped to deal with it if it happens in real life.
3,"For me it was the waking up part. My grandma died not long before that. I dreamt that I was in middle school again, with all my memories of me as an adult. It was a time when I visited her a lot. I dreamt that I ran out of the class room to her place and she was still alive. Until I woke up."
4,I once dreamt of getting my throat slit. I could feel the blood entering my lungs and I was panicking. The worst thing was that I could still breath slightly
5,"what was the dream abt???

(u don't have to tell me sry if i come off as pushy)"
6,"The worst dreams I have is when I dream about having a happy life with a family and kids (I'm in my early twenties and single) and a fulfilling career.
Waking up feels like my family was murdered and its depressing as fuck even though logically I know they were all fictional"
7,"I once had a dream that my uncle cut my spine right down the middle with an axe. 
My back felt so weird when I woke up."
8,"I keep on having dreams where I'm getting stabbed in every pressure point on my body that I know of and I wake up with a yelp, it's awful."
9,"Wait, you guys remember your dreams?"
10,Wait yâ€™all actually sleep?
11,I had a dream where Walter White broke in to my house
12,"Once I have a dream where my uterus just fell out of me, I passed it through me like a blood clot. It looked really deformed and the fallopian tubes where fused to my ovaries, the worst part is it was still connected to me through this fleashy cord almost like an umbilical cord."
13,Me every day
14,"I once woke up with a funny taste in my mouth, and a spider leg stick to my lip"
15,What was the dream
16,Once I dreamed that I hit and killed a child with my car. I could feel blood soaking my legs and I saw his disembodied torso on the road ahead of me. It was ducking horrifying.
17,"i had a dream yesterday that i was stabbing someone to death, in their face. it was so vivid i woke up crying"
18,"I used to have recurring dreams about getting shot. The ones where I got shot in the head weren't bad. There'd be a BANG, everything would go black, and I'd wake up. 

The ones where I'd get shot in the chest, or in the back, were horrible. Pretty much how you described your dream. Feeling indescribable panic, as my lungs filled with blood, and I lost consciousness. 

Shit sucked. It would always ruin my whole day. Thankfully I haven't had one of those dreams for a while."
