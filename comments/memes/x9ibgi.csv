83,"No wonder them, it's the land of plenty and of life"
84,My mother is significantly taller than my grandmother and my niece used to call both of them grandma. She decided a few years ago that was getting confusing so she started referring to my grandma as fun sized grandma
85,"To confirm this, I'll need to sample some cookies and pie. For academic reasons."
86,What did the guy with the deleted comment say
87,"So much this, dark one."
88,Username checks out
89,"How do you make ice from sacrif? Is it just freezing, or do you have to stir so it becomes creamy? Any additional ingredients recommended?"
90,Indeed it is
91,That's cute! Thanks for telling it 😃
92,I'll see what I can do
93, Just gotta know where and what to eat.
94,Yes I also require cookies and pies but for research purposes.
95,Because if they said anything about this grandma they are a true monster
96,Something like “or not”
97,"Never even been, I think the next most plentiful is the AZ high desert. Manzanita, prickly pear, wild grains, quail, antelope, and quite a bit more. Just gotta know where and what to eat."
98,Bad about this grandma*
99,I've spent quite a bit of time in that area as well. Very different but both are beautiful. If you get the opportunity to visit the pacific northwest I highly recommend it
100,"I definitely will, it's in its own league as far as wild game and forage goes. Plus, fresh fish that's not from lake pleasant"
