1,"9/11 is not even that Scary, probably for US, but in Human history 9/11 it's like nothing compared to Holocaust, human slaughtering raping torturing eachother, Genocide, Double Nukes in Japan, and no Batmo Biel."
2,"People really think 9/11 was the WORST event in all of human history, ever? Really? I feel like there were far worse, and far more devastating things."
3,I love the comparison between the Holocaust and 9/11. Definitely equal. Definitely.
4,Lol 9/11 isn't in the top 500 of horrible shit
5,1 hr of WW1 was worse than 9/11
6,That’s definitely a tragedy
7,The fact that he was witty enough to comment that in the first two minutes has me dead lmao
8,MFs be comparing an event that killed ovwr 1000 people to a tradegy that killed over 6 million
9,"9/11? America not having free health care is more of a disaster than 9/11 ,how is 9/11 even a contender to the worst?"
10,"Pretty sure the Spanish flu or black plague is way worse than the holocaust, 9/11 is infinitely more tame than the holocaust, these people be buggin"
11,The panama canal killed roughly 5609 workers but the death toll is predicted to be higher
12,Dildo-ganking definitely has a point
13,No. No. He's got a point.
14,humans coming into existence was the most horrifying thing
15,"9/11 is the worst in human history!? In the 20th century alone we had two world wars where millions died and two atomic bombs were dropped on two cities. 
But 5000 people dying in a terrorist attack is the most horrific in ""HUMAN HISTORY""!?! WTF"
16,Probably the black plague?
17,Why am I not surprised someone put 9/11
18,Everyone saying 9/11 is definitely from america
19,People writing 9/11 have never picked up any kind of history book or article in their life
20,Ah yes 2000 odd people dying is the most horrific event in the world. There’s a world outside of America.
21,"Jesus, I laughed way too hard at this."
22,Alicia Keys not naming her child Car
23,"If you think 9 11 is the most horrific event you have very limited knowledge of history, even just the past 50 years"
24,The obliteration of Carthage by the Romans was pretty brutal
25,"People who says 9/11 was the worst, probably play only  Minecraft and call it the only best game ever. ☕"
26,People saying 9/11 just cause it was recent and western pisses me off
27,9/11 is such an embarrassingly american answer
28,"Going by lowest estimates and death toll you have:
World war 2 at 70m deaths
The mongol conquests at 50m deaths
And the Tiaping rebellion at 20m deaths
However ~20m deaths during world war 2 we're caused by famine. And induced famine across history probably beats all these(British induced famine in India killed ~20m in one instance). Besides huge death tolls several event come to mind. The multiple burnings of the library of Alexandria destroyed most of the worlds knowledge meaning we basically had to start from scratch. It'd be like every library and the internet suddenly exploded. The death of Archimedes set math back by roughly 2000 years as he had a lesser form of calculus which with slight development could have brought math to near our current understanding but much sooner. And the mongol invasion destroyed the song dynasty which held 70% of the worlds wealth and abandoned military funding trying to focus on industrialization instead. This made them an easy target and most was destroyed but they were close to proto-industrialization about ~700 years early. To put the into prospective we are ~200 years advanced from when Europe entered the industrialization era if the song dynasty had continued we'd be around 500 years more advanced in our current technology. Basically humans care more about personal and political achievement more than human life or the progression of our race :/ just the fact we felt it was necessary to burn the library of Alexandria multiple times to assert dominance kinda makes you lose faith in humanity."
29,"4000 people is really not significant in comparison to 6 million. Not even significant in comparison to 400,000"
30,r/angryupvote
31,1 man 1 jar.
32,"9/11? Seriously? How about the Black Death? WO 1, concentration camps, the early seat of Alexander the Great"
33,Otto Mo Biel is a name that at least works on the surface
34,"I would say Catholicism/Christianity in general. You got the crusades, the Spanish inquisition, American witch trials, the third reich. I could keep going"
35,"Stalin... He killed twice as many people as the Holocaust, and less we forget the Cossacks"
36,Pre colonial U.S. natives and Holocaust
37,"In a more serious note the worts even had to have been the dark ages , 500 years of completely no development of any kind ,no cultural ,technological,medical ,nothing ...500 years of human history wasted on religion and who knows how many people dead in their name"
38,The killing/genocide/wipe out of all Canaanits by Israelits. Also every child and every woman was killed according to the bible. All commanded by God
39,Definitely colonial slavery.
40,"Top 3 worst events in all of history

1. 9/11

2. The death of my cat year ago

3. Hitler or something idk..."
41,Now I committed war crimes in Afghanistan by putting deadly gas in their huts and trapping them in ttheir house. But you're gonna throw up when you hear this  I don't even wanna say this but >!someone commented the fourth time in a chain!<
42,the furry wars
43,Ever heard Eastern Europe
44,"rape of nanking is up there imo. not a lot of numbers but horrible horrible things.

but really its a terrible question to begin with, and its begging for people to claim that one tragedy is not that bad compared to another. can we all agree they were equally horrific for the people that lived and died through them?"
45,"America gets a taste of what’s it’s been doing to the world for decades and genuinely believes it’s greatest atrocity in human history, you people need a reality check"
46,My birth
47,I’m guessing the reason for 9/11 is that it happened 20 years ago within many peoples lifetimes vs some event in history that you learn about through reading or accounts from old people
48,Could've named Mahoganylake
49,"Japanese war crimes, even Nazis said HolUp"
50,The malvinas war
51,probably one of the battles that happened during that couple thousand year period where giant empires would arise and fall all the time.
52,"Define event. A one time short event, like a terrorist attack, or a long term event, like a World War?"
53,There are two types of people
54,Hmm
55,"Why is 0.818181818181818 so traumatic, because it repeats?"
56,Danganronpa fans: well actually...
57,I agree
58,"The assassination of Harambe, circa 2016."
59,"The use of nuclear weapons. Director Oppenheimer quoted Vishnu after the first nuclear test, saying ""Behold I am become death, the destroyer of world's."""
60,Ottomans genocides come to mind. Totalling up like 2m+ kills
61,How ignorant could you be to rate 9/11 as worse than the Holocaust.
62,"The Many Endless Genocides of Africa, French Revolution, Trenches of WWI, spiders, Holocaust, Pearl Harbor, Rape of Nanking, 9/11"
63,"After batmo Biel I'm going with the Americans invading everything and everyone and the nuclear bomb in Japan still is 1 of the most discussing and regarding holocaust or otterman to 911 to Syria and the oil fraud in middle east,you weren't asked to measure the Shame it's your opinion not a measuring contest as far as I know,I could name English oppression and I'm not even going to start the religion debate or devisions or whatever phase yeah choose there, most of all answers are tied to religion and energy,so my final answer is religions and energy is the greatest of all."
64,Great Leap Forward. Hands down the biggest crime ever.
65,This should be posted on r/shitamericanssay lmao
66,Trump becoming president
67,Seahawks not running the ball
68,Was thinking the Sandy Hook tragedy.  Then I saw the Jessica Beil and …..yeah
69,"What is it with Americans and thinking 9/11 was the worst atrocity to have ever happened? Sure, it was horrific, but it doesn’t even scratch the surface of the most horrific events in history. Are history books *that* uncommon over there? Or is it just because it happened there and nowhere else matters, because America"
70,Or y’know… the Rape of Nanking
71,The failed invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan alone was a bigger tragedy than 9/11. Imagine how many people died and how much innocent civilians suffered compared to 9/11.
72,">Double Nukes in Japan, and no Batmo Biel.

Also the Tokyo bombings some time before* the nukes"
73,"I do agree that 9/11 doesn't compare to most tragic events, but that doesn't mean it wasn't scary.

I lived right outside of NYC when it happened and was in grade school (fun fact, my dad took me to the towers on Sept 9th as a day trip).  Teachers were running through the halls yelling that something happens, kids were crying because many were so young they didn't know where mom or dad even worked in NYC.

I remember getting dropped off to school, and then shortly after buses pulling back up, parents running into the office to get their kids.

My buddy lived in Virginia during the evening and still remembers the sound of a massive number of jets trying to get to NYC as quick as possible.

Point being, at my age, it was scary. It's still scary that it did and could happen again. It was honestly traumatizing, not PTSD but a core memory. The people responding to that are not saying that because they are Americans, it's because they are Americans and 14 and American education on world history is a joke. I see their answers as more sad and a comment on our education system than anything else."
74,Don't forget the Fr🤮nch
75,And the Holocaust is a milder form of Leopold IIs genocide in Africa. 9/11 dowsnt really compare atall tbh
76,Americans ☕
77,Yeah like did they even see Cats?
78,"I mean 9/11 was awful and horrific, but how does 3000 compare to 6 million?"
79,Americans☕️
80,Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my opinion is worst that happened recently.
81,"They are incredibly biased, they’re probably twenty something year old Americans, so it happened in their country in their life time. Without bias, I would say the unit 731 experiments in japan were the worst thing that ever happened."
82,"Only 42,000 non-smokers die from cigarettes every year.

That's a 9/11 death toll at least once a month.

Clearly 9/11 is worse than not banning tobacco."
83,"While I completely agree, I can see why they said it. For most people the Holocaust (and other acts of genocide and brutality throughout history) is just…history. Horrendous, but history. 

9/11 meanwhile is something a lot of people commenting will likely remember, it will be etched in their brain forever and probably was terrifying for them and then had a huge change to the world we live in, so I think it’s pretty understandable why it might just to people’s thoughts first."
84,The Toba super eruption in Sumatra that nearly caused our extinction for instance.
85,well fucking duh.
86,"When asksd what is the worst event in human history, how many people do you think actually have an in depth knowledge of human history, teuth be told id probably also also holocaust or 9/11 but then again i admit i have a crap understanding of history.  As awful as both of those events are, id fully believe you if you told me theres worse, those are just two of the easy to remeber ones as they are both relatively recent, and at least for 9/11 many can still remeber watching it happen, or god forbid, being a part of it, its a traumatic experience, so for them its an easy pick."
87,Honestly I think 9/11 is treated as a way to big catastrophe
88,9/11 wasn't even that bad natural disasters kill more people all the time.
89,"neither come close to the worst event, the guy said ""ALL of human history"""
90,"Not even top 5,000"
91,"But people remember 9/11 more because some of them went through it and were traumatized by it. Some lost family in it, so objectively yeah the holocaust is worse way worse but its just history to them, WW1 is worse but thats just history. They didn’t experience it."
92,6 million*
93,Some historians believe it reached 11 million
94,No free healthcare definitely killed more people than 9/11
95,"Depends on definition of worse tbh  
In terms of human life lost, yeah it's worse.  
But the Holocaust was brought on by another human intentionally causing millions of other humans to suffer and die.  
The Spanish Flu and Black Death weren't cruel, and the Holocaust was. In my mind, at least, that makes the Holocaust worse."
96,A lot of events are worse than the Holocaust. A lot of people who would say holocaust probably don't even know that there were more non-Jewish people who died because of it than Jews.
97,"you realise around 40 million people died in ww2? in the battle of the Somme(ww1) there were 50,000 casualties in a single day. and that's just recent history. 1/3 of the world's population died during the plague..."
98,Fr though
99,Americans ☕️
100,Totally caught me off guard.  I’m still laughing and everyone in this thread is arguing.
