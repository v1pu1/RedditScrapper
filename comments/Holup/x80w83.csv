1,Why does a British guy need a bulletproof vest? Guns are illegal. Did nobody tell the criminals?
2,Less people want to kill him in Ukraine.
3,"In a fucked up way it makes sense.

In the UK people know him and killing him would have a DIRECT affect on their lives. 

In Ukraine, surrounded by loyal and heavily armed soldiers NOBODY is going to want to kill him. The Russians wont want to kill him even if they could also get Zelensky since that would risk ACTIVE UK involvement and the Ukrainians would not want to kill him because that would isolate UK support."
4,When did the UK stop being a war zone?
5,Its a stab vest. Or anti stab vest i supose. Actually it doesnt prevent you from getting stabbed so i dont know how its called. But it is for knives.
6,Hasnâ€™t happened yet
