23,“@kvnesky”
24,"Dominoes UK: “After much deliberation, this is the most petty think we have been able to think of that’s we can post. We here at this inconsequential Italian fast-food restaurant can’t come up with anything more shallow to say.”

Edit: why did this post get removed?"
53,The Dominos marketing team is probably some stoner with a laptop at the back of the shop. It'll be someone else's turn tomorrow.
54,You really think that Irish domino's cares what goes on with their account
55,Missed the joke
56,Sweet.  Do they deliver to America?
57,And not in the Netherlands. Free delivery
58,Usually free delivery means it’s hidden in the price of the pizza
59,😂😂

68,"You can edit comments, y’know"
69,It hasn't for me
70,"Yes, but only thoughts and prayers."
71,Not in Ireland
72,"""free""? Sounds like another word for socialist."
73,"Actually, no. Many pizzerias have an online site with prices and they are same when you order and dine in. However not the same with delivery apps since they always upcharge the price of food"
74,Nope. You're paying for that lovely American capitalism.
75,">living in poverty

Wonder what India would be like if the British hadn't leeched off of it for so long."
76,"You would have a bit of a brain if you let Intelligent thoughts follow you, but alas, you’re always faster. So, kudos on the speed."

89,Then I’ll take 3 thoughts and 2 prayers.
90,"Yarp, chances are the people dining in are paying for a hidden delivery service as well, but in their case it’s probably a hidden table cleaning fee. 

Businesses don’t want to loose money by doing things for free, it’s all hidden in the price"
91,"How do you know that if delivery wasn't a thing, that the pizzas wouldn't be cheaper for everyone though?"
92,"Here they just have minimum order for free delivery, if you order $15 it's free. Less than that will cost you."

95,Damn I gotta write this burn down
96,r/rareinsults
97,Gahd dayuuuum
98,This isnt about a speeding ticket or murdering someone in self defence but about torturing children. I would let the law deal with it. I would help with cost of defence because everyone is innocent until proven guilty however i would feel i am obligated to protect other children in my family and neighbourhood to have them imprisoned if found guilty as the queens son was. I wouldnt be just paying off the innocent vistims like some preacher in a church and let my kid go around rampant continuely harming others.
99,"Sexually abusing a minor? Murder? Rape? I would drag my kid to the police by myself.

Some things are just inexcusable"
100,Am I missing something. Pls explain
