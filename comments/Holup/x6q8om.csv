1,"I mean, it's an old story right. 14 year old girls were brides and mothers *regularly* until very recent times (in the scope of things) 

I hate this application of modern values to days gone by. We do shit now that will not be condoned in the future, too."
2,"Wasn't she like 114 by that time already?

Edit: wrong princess? But in his defence, didn't he think she was dead?

Edit 2: didn't make it better..."
3,"i mean, this may be true in the original tale.  In the disney version,  i dont think they mention either of their ages.  Neither looks 14 OR 30 imo.  I think snow may actually be younger than 14 in the original."
4,Is this the spit swap scene?
5,I guess It was Legal To Show Those kind of Stuff
6,"What's worse is that in the original story, she's a 7 year old, and even though the prince's age isn't mentioned, he should at least be a young adult. 

Btw, in one of the versions (my favourite version) he fell in love with the corpse and married it, but one of his servants got so tired of it that he punched Snow White until she woke up lmao."
7,"To be fair, back in medieval times, girls often married and had children halfway into their lifespans (15 years old)."
8,Love is love.
9,"Conflating the problematic standards of centuries-old fables and fairy tales originating from the Dark Ages to that of a modern reiteration in the form of a cartoon just to be a contrarian.  If this is the Hill you wish to die on, then by the same standard, Henzel & Gretel, 3 Little Pigs, and many more children's tales would be just as unsettling."
10,"‚ÄúHey boss, we just did this in the conference room!‚Äù"
11,Wait... You know her age and watched this? Pedo...
12,People when they realize there are some parts of Japan where the age of consent is 13 year old: ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
13,"The original fairy tale actually does not mention their ages, so not sure what this is referencing"
14,"So, like‚Ä¶ Leo Decaprio, right?   

Why are you booing me?! I‚Äôm right!"
15,If it was other way around every lad would wish he was sleeping princess
16,They never say how long she was in the glass coffin for.
17,Why does he have lipstick on
18,That's the hottest new anime right there. Right in line with Japanese loli fetish
19,"Okay, I did not know Prince was 30+. The hell?"
20,"As a kid, I kinda just assumed they were both early 20s, is  their age ever mentioned in the cartoon? Or just the original stories?"
21,Not that gone tbh. In Japan to this day there are still some areas where the age of consent is 13-16.
22,So Mohammed wasn't a paedophile after all.... interesting....üòè
23,"They really weren't having kids at 14. People understood that teenagers weren't fully developed, and due to lower nutrition menstrual cycles tended to start much later as well.

Nobel people tended to get married young for political reasons, and tended to have their first kid in their late teens. Poorer people waited until later to get married and have their kids in early 20s"
24,"What's wrong with imposing our values on earlier times? No one defends slavery because it was ""of the time"" and we shouldn't defend nonces either."
25,"Necrophilia is a victimless crime in a way. 

Not condoning it. 

It‚Äôs fucking cold‚Ä¶"
26,To be fair the original fairy tales were kinds unsettling to begin with.
27,There are literally only 2 islands that still have it at 13  and both have a population of 0.
28,Nah R.Kelly
29,"Most of Europe is 14-16, whats your point?"
30,"You demon, you drive a gasoline car? Fucking monster."
31,I always use a condon
32,The originals are much darker!
33,Exactly lmao
34,Yep with another 14 - 16 year old not an adult
35,What is yours? üòê
36,"No, the people who push cars, both petrol and electric (teslas are bad for the environment too) are the monsters. It's Ford, Musk, the politicians that refuse to make change, those are the monsters."
37,Thats not how the law works in most countries though when it says age of consent.
38,"I wasnt really making one, I wasnt sure why Japan was singled out so I brought in Europe to share the love."
39,"You aren't worried about imposing your beliefs on the elite of the day - so now you're cool with the dude fucking the 14 year old, but fuck the guys in charge. Ya?"
40,What? No? Fucking 14 year olds is bad that should go without saying.
41,"Ok well do you drive a gas car or don't ya?

You get my point by now right?"
42,"I don't have a car and I never intend to, I just take the tube, but look, its a false analogy, the crime with petrol cars isn't the driving of them, its the perpetuation. With paedophilia, the crime is doing it, so yeah, fucking a kid is bad."
