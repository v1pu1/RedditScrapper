1,"The best type of racist ""The Honest Ones"" the ones who are at least brave enough to stand on their beliefs even though they are very racist.

Nowadays most racist  just hide in plain sight and do all of their racist stuff covertly and try to hide behind loopholes in the law.

20,"I’m all for the open racists. It’s the people that stereotype because they “heard” it or “read” it somewhere. Of course, they’re not racist, but “sTaTisTIcS sHoW” and they have “bLaCk fRiEnDs”

If you’re racist, say it and stop being a bitch is all I’m saying.

21,Hmm. Now just gotta square that with not getting fired and expelled from society.
22,"Not even, a lot of racism nowadays is rebranded as help, support, or simply virtue signaling to push someone's ideals, fit in, or for clout in some way, without any actual intentions to solve anything"

32,"So are you saying racism doesn't exist?

But I do agree with you saying that a lot of people are just playing on people emotions and fear Mongering in order to manipulate them to push they're own agenda.

I'm just saying it's a mixed bag of f up out there and there's definitely racist with power and authority still out there so we have to make sure that we stay alert we're at the same time being genuine and authentic

Because the best lied that the devil was able to tell is the lie that he doesn't exist""
