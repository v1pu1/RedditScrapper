2,"Lots of things are named like this to indicate time to travel 

For example NZ has a beach called ""90 mile beach"" which is only ~60 miles long. This is because when you travel by horse on sand it takes much longer than on firm ground. The name implies that there is no firm land for the entire length and thus it will take the time expected to travel 90 miles by horse"
