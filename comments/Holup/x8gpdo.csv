1,Wonderful. If they all go to Mars we can do whatever we want here
2,"with all the rich people gone, there’s no poor people like us to do the work for them and lord knows 80% them have never worked actual jobs in their lives so yeah they’re definitely fucked"
3,But how will we survive without their superior leadership or all the jobs they create??? /s
4,When they leave all they will leave is scorched earth
5,Well if the people at the top just leave then the next in-line for companies will be elected. And for Gov Reps we will actually have a chance to select some competent people without the rich fools interjection. You forget they aren’t the ones that do the work like maintaining the infrastructure of this world. The working class does that
