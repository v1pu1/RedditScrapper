17,"Why does it seem like any random European girl on TV is 10 times hotter than any US/UK actress from even the biggest budget stuff?

The girl from House of the Dragon looks like she was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The best looking girl in Rings of Power, Galadriel, is a 7/10 with zero T&A.

And it's not as if these Anglo girls have some insane acting skills either, or are getting paid less than these French/Italian/Spanish/German girls."
