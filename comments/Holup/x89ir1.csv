100,"Soke intresting info about the prostate:

>The prostate forms while an embryo is developing in the womb. It starts as an embryonic urogenital sinus. This sinus later develops into the urinary and reproductive organs.It is exactly the same in male and female embryos until the 10th or 12th week of gestationTrusted Source. After this, hormones called androgens start forming the prostate in male embryos. These hormones create male prostate activity once a person enters puberty."
