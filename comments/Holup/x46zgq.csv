1,It's much cheaper to put my face in titties at the strip club than hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt
2,Nah fam...first time you have to put your face in some sweaty 400 pound man titles complete with moob cheese you'd be out of the profession faster than a toupee in a hurricane...
3,"I have nipples, doc. You gonna put your ear on my chest?"
4,If you go to a hospital 90% patients r fat old people with diseases i don't want to even touch with a hazmat suit. Which hospital r all the supermodels going to?
5,All fun till some old lady comes & you have to hold those low hanging wrinkly fruits
6,Fun fact: I diagnosed my friend with a heart murmur because I could hear her heartbeat while giving her a hug. I have no medical training whatsoever. She went to the doctor two weeks later and turns out I was right.
7,"This is just... inaccurate.
I don't know where the story of a bird in the tree came from. Laenecc got the idea from children playing with the sounds a pin makes on a long piece of wood. 
On top of that, he wasn't just embarrassed to put his ear to a woman's chest, it was also that one patient in particular was very plump, which was hindering the Laenecc's hearing and feeling of the heart, thus the impromptu invention of the first stethoscope.

23,"I feel like I’m making this up in my head, but people who are vagina enthusiasts becoming OB’s or foot enthusiasts becoming pediatrists, you’re gonna be looking at lots of sick vaginas and nasty feet. Not every customer is some mid-20’s blond lol."
24,I now know what I must do if a time machine is invented.
25,This is why I couldn't ever go to medical school.
26,You'd be putting your head on man tiddies as well

45,"Good, glad he invited that, but before he did couldn't doctors just have easily put their ear on the patients' backs??"

47,"It’s okay guys, years later another doctor came up with the condition hysteria, which was treated by the doc massaging the woman’s lower bits to climax.  Kept up till someone invented the vibrator."
48,imagine being a veterinarian with no stethoscope
49,"Before the stethoscope, they also used to test how fast or slow the heart beat or 'motor' was by moving their heads from side to side. True story."
50,"Just yesterday, i was thinking of becoming a gynaecologist."
51,I read that it started with a doctor struggling to hear an obese patients heartbeat so he rolled paper into a cone and used that

67,Damn you Rene
68,think what the partner had to go through seeing dr and his partner before 1816
69,I'll pay that
70,"Yeah...nah, I'll pass.  
The average visits from people in a doctors office are going to be VERY FAR from the type of body you'd want to be subjecting yourself to if you went with this method."

83,"Early American drs were such prudes that they didn't examine women AT all.

What little they did examine had to be done with the husband in the room. She had to be fully clothed. No skin showing.

Sometimes this included things like child birth. A concept I've never begun to understand. What exactly were drs doing if they couldn't even look at her, let alone touch her.

Thank goodness for midwives."
84,"It’s an investment you see, after the hundreds of thousands spent, it is now free for you to do so. Even better, you can be paid for it. Sure if you do not live long enough it wouldn’t be worth the investment, but if you do, it’s a wise long-term financial investment."

86,Strong USA vibes
87,"But are you really helping Destinee's arteriosclerosis, man?  She needs more than $1s and $5s to pay for her meds!"

90,Medical school tuition is fairly reasonable in some countries. For example ~ €1500 in Spain per year
91,[removed]
92,or become pornstar to get paid for it.
93,I feel like men's aversion to other men touching them and vica versa would have more prevalent than 'I want to respect women's boundaires and give them proper medical care'. Especially considering other 'medical practices' or lack there of.
