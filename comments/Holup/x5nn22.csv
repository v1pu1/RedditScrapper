1,"WTF






That's all I have to say"
2,"The guy gets in trouble but not the girl for abandoning the child?

Edit: Why is this getting so many upvotes-"
3,"""Out of the womb, Into the tomb!"""
4,"How the fuck can you be uncertain that someone gave birth in the middle of school. No pain, no screaming, not some fully pregnant person running to the washroom in pain."
5,What age is class 12?
6,this went worse and worse every 3 worlds
7,How is this the boys fault that SHE tossed the kid like a prom night dumpster baby?
8,"Yep in India this happens frequently. The  system thinks that only a girl can be manipulated to have sex and not the guy, no matter what the age is"
9,Natural fertilizer?
10,Nobody gonna mention that someone in grade 10 was probably only 14 or 15 9 months before birth. So too young to consent. So a victim of statutory rape.  So dude is arrested for being raped.
11,"How the fuck girl's parents won't know, that their girl is pregnant...😑😑😑"
12,so the younger male parent that didnt try to murder the baby is the one under arrest...am I understanding this correctly?
13,Ah yes. It’s clearly the fathers fault for her MURDERING A CHILD
14,https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/crime/tn-class-12-girl-delivers-baby-throws-newborn-into-bushes-near-school-class-10-boy-held-for-impregnating-her-article-93979068
15,Yeetus that fetus
16,**N word** what
17,"Abortions are murder.  And they prevent you from the fun that is traumatizing another life that is too fragile to care for itself.

Fuck them kids

![gif](giphy|rVYbN0uxznAaI)"
18,Not humorous in any way.
19,The boy did nothing wrong! WTF? Internet moment
20,"Adult Female has Sex With Underage Male, Male Arrested. More accurate title"
21,"For a second I thought they meant, 12 year old girl delivers baby, and 10 year old boy held for impregnating her"
22,Nobody's mentioned that the one foot only has four toes?
23,"So the guys like 14 and she's 17, so raped him as he couldn't consent then murdered a child. I don't want to be on this planet anymore."
24,Personally I think the adults around these children (parents and teachers as it was in a school) should be held accountable not the boy or girl.
25,What is grade 10 in the uk?
26,தமிழ்நாட்டின் மானம் பறக்கிறது.
27,And here I am virgin at 23
28,"I've like a million question just from reading it. 🤔 Did her school already know that she was pregnant? Why did her parents send her to school knowing she was pregnant? How the hell was she not monitored since she was pregnant? It just doesn't make sense. You're telling me ' a girl got pregnant, waited 9(maybe 10) months to deliver the baby, delivers it in a school without anyone knowing it and then tossed the baby into bushes'???? And if she's mentally unstable, shouldn't they have kept her at home just so she doesn't do anything crazy??? Wtf--"
29,"Sometimes, nuclear winter doesn't sound that bad tbh"
30,Huh wtf. Just had a kid and threw it in the bushes and went to school I'm guessing...
31,"Judging from the grammar, this is India?"
32,Look forward to more of these in the south the more abortions get banned.
33,Any one got the link to the article
34,Sounds like there’s context taken out of the picture here for more clicks
35,"Why hasn't anyone asked: ""Why the Fuck does the baby only have 9 TOES ?!!"", LOL ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
36,Spawn kill
37,Of course it's Tamil Nadu. Why wouldn't it be.
38,"Not enough importance is put on the lives of these tiny people. Way too much stigma is pushed on being a single mother. Where the proper societal support for new mothers or mothers to be? Why is the only offered answer death? It gets more publicity and support. Where's the help? How about not making having a child feel so terrible. Reasonable, trustable child care. Decent pay and benefits. Ditch the stigma of a single parent home. Promote adoption more. Why is this a preferable option? People suck in groups."
39,America justice system?
40,Spawn kill
41,"🎶""I'm just a prom night dumpster baby. I got no mom or dad""🎶"
42,That baby only has nine toes! How is this not the top comment?
43,What people don’t realize is we live in gynocentric society protect women and treat men like they are disposable
44,This from America?
45,holup
46,Spawn camping
47,Is this real?
48,Did Kerrigan just yeet Jimmie's kid

58,"That right there is two teenagers that should be forcibly sterilized, today. Fucking hell"
59,School shooting? More like school wrecking
60,What
61,All of us are dead plot
62,Yup completely represent this decade where people go to schools and get fucked and use school as date sites
63,ain’t no way
64,"please tell me class 12 girl means like 12th grade, as in a senior in high school, and class 10 boy means like sophomore, that wouldn't make this any less fkd up, but please tell me its not what i think it is"
65,"OMG! That's disgusting,where?"
66,"What's a ""class 12 girl""? Is she part of a program or is that her level or something? I've never heard of a class something person."
67,There is no love like mom's love.
68,I dont know what to say
69,Too much internet and xvids in India.
70,Is it my eyes or are there only 4 toes on the right foot?
71,Chutiyo ko 4th se hi batao condom ke baare me🤣
72,"just let them explore life  whats  can happen
few years later ..."
73,What I've learnt: kids are having sex and I'm not.
74,"Bro.... I'd normally would say they don't know what condom is ....
But as a man who is from Bangladesh.... 
I can certainly say ... Nah... Them cheap condoms don't work bro ...."
75,[deleted]
76,"4 toes vs 5 toes 

Hmm"
77,This is something a trump supporter would do.💀
78,People so devoid of excitement in their lives they have to try to be hero in something all for bragging rights.
79,Let me guess. Florida??
80,Am I the only one who noticed that baby only got 4 toes on one foot?
81,Damn why was she with someone two classes below her
82,"Obviously a weird situation, but how couldn’t anyone tell, why would the boy be in trouble. Boys can’t even produce that young unless he hit puberty early and girls can’t carry unless they have started their cycle. This all seems faked to me."
83,I feel bad for that baby.
84,"This is what happens when you don't teach health/sex ed and take away abortion - innocent unwanted babies suffer lifetimes of abuse and neglect, then most grow up to abuse & neglect because that's all they know. Put people in a desperate situations and they do desperate things. Poor baby."
85,The context is that the girl was mentally unstable and the guy was held for sexual assault charges
86,Spawn kill?
87,Fetus yeetus
88,Heir for a day
89,"This happened in India. Everybody is screaming, in pain and/or running while being surrounded by a million others doing exactly the same"
90,"To be fair, she could have been hiding her pregnency well and screaming isn't neccesary. She may also had an easy delivery."
91,"Depends, but generally almost adults around 17-18"
92,"This specific girl was 16 when she gave birth. Not sure if she was really in class 12 though. The article says in the headline class 12, but in the text class XI which would mean 11.

>A **Class XI** girl delivered a baby boy and abandoned it in the bushes near her school in a village in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu."
93,"More important question is, did the baby fucking die?"
94,ok but why don't they just mention the age or am I just dumb
95,"15-17 in germany (you enter school at 6, sometimes 5 if you are ready, sometimes 7 if you arent ready)"
