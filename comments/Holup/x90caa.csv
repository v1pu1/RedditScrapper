5,"That's neat, this way you know, what you shouldn't grab in the dark."

7,"Thank good this trend is history...Lollo Ferrari and alike were just disgusting.

If a woman lets her boobs be recreated after cancer e.g. that's totally fine, but these fake balloons are just gross."
8,"Agreed. My ex had a very conservative pair that were done because she was flat chested and wanted them for a confidence boost. She went with around a 32C, which is not that massive. The end result, visually, was fine but they felt so awful to the touch. It felt like I was grabbing a super soft balloon full of air or thin liquid. I could legit squeeze them completely flat and feel my fingers through each side. They did not feel natural at all. 

I fully understand getting them due cancer or if you were born with essentially no breast and want the confidence boost but, anyone who says they're a replacement for real breast or say you can't tell a difference, are straight up lying. I'm so damn glad that trend is dying. Hopefully  the giant fake asses and giant fake lips are going to die off next."
