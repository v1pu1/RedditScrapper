1,I bet he's a Satinist!
2,‚ÄúWrinkles like shit‚Äù didn‚Äôt give him cause to think?
3,Spend that time away from social media in a quality fabric store
4,Islanaphobe!
5,fuck dude.. I read muslims
6,"When you're old enough to have kids, get your baby a muslin blanket when they're a couple months old.  They love that shit."
7,"I mean social media just has a way of poisoning our perception of fabrics, his advice still stands."
8,Naah i still hate muslins
9,"I think the guy needs to stay away from social media and tv debates for a week


/s"
10,I read that as Muslims and I still assumed it was a fabric purely from the rest of the tweet
11,Still gives me a chuckle every time I see this ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
12,Them too
13,"Didn't know what muslin is, probably would have thought the same"
14,">Do one thing just keep distance yourself from social media and tv debates for a week.

Oh, the irony."
15,Soooo the guy who responded thought she was complaining that Muslims have no elasticity?
16,Bait. The capitalization shows she was trolling.
17,Plot twist - he is also talking about the fabric
18,Shakira Law
19,What did second person say that was so bad?  Maybe he knows some muslins that are very nice.  Maybe he works with muslins every day without problems.  Maybe he has muslins in his own house and loves them.
20,"being both a muslim and also a native of Bangladesh (where the real muslin used to be made), i had a good laugh but had to tone it down cuz its 4am rn and dont wanna wake up the whole house XD"
21,She actually wanted to say that but indirectly !!
22,"She was definitely throwing bait out with that one. As the meme says, had me in the first half"
23,Clearly that woman just needs a good [Mulsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulsum_%28beverage%29) in her life.
24,I hate Higgers. That guy keeps hitting on my mom. Full name Nate Higgers
25,My dyslexia makes me feel racist sometimes cause I definitely read that as Muslims
26,I read Muslims but then once I saw the rest of the tweet I knew it wasn‚Äôt about them
27,"i read ""muslims"" üíÄ"
28,Turns out it was a typo and she meant Muslims /s
29,Ah man. TV makes me hate fabric so much.
30,"Well I‚Äôm willing to bet she capitalized the ‚ÄúM‚Äù to stir up some shit, knowing it would be misread."
31,The trick is to use muslin exclusively as a base or to draw patterns on. Rarely should the final product be made of or have the muslin showing.
32,This is a /r/woosh more than an /r/holup
33,This guy should follow his own advice
34,I too capitalize words to make them look like proper nouns to mislead people into thinking I said something controversial yet incredibly attention grabbing.
35,"My partner is dyspraxic and dyslexic, with a stutter on top. When our daughter was a baby we bought a bunch of muslin cloths for drying her butt during nappy changes and stuff. 

He could not stop calling them muslims.

Every day it was 
*""Can you pass me the good Muslim?""*
or
*""Can you chuck these Muslims in the washing machine for me?""*
or worse,
*""Mind that pile of dirty Muslims"" while gesturing to a pile of soiled cloths on the floor.*

It was funny indoors. When we were in public it was sometimes a bit awkward..."
36,"Well, that's one letter away from a social media ban."
37,Yeah and she incorrectly capitalized the word on purpose.
38,Shortly after you tie horses to all of someones limbs and get the horses to run in different directions that persons limbs just rip right off. People have no elasticity and since Muslims are people they also have no elasticity so I get how he got confused.
39,"Too be fair, this seemed like an intentional troll/bait, since you wouldn‚Äôt capitalize it like that mid-sentence."
40,Fucking Lacists
41,I don‚Äôt get why people blur out the usernames. Just copy whatever a person has said in a post and search for it and you‚Äôll find it with their username.
42,"Fabric aside, as a Muslim, can confirm."
43,Muslins and Satin are allies.
44,This has me in stitches.
45,As someone who sews I prefer linen over muslin any day. Shit fabric
46,I love the measured response of the guy instead of him jumping down her throat.
47,He clearly didn‚Äôt watch Project Runway
48,So true! Tried to make a slingshot out of my muslin friend and he smacked me. Effin' useless.
49,"Wtf. I love muslins. They were the best when my kids were smaller. Could be a towel, could be a blanket, could be a puke protector, could be an anti rolling tube for the crib and so much more. Best gift if you know someone having a baby."
50,"Worked at Joann‚Äôs. Have said Fuck muslins many times in my head as I rushed to try to sort the disaster of the muslin wall at close.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs whitish, it must belong here right?‚Äù - every other Joann‚Äôs employee ever"
51,Just a piece of fabric? Excuse me sir but their is a head attached to a person under that towel!
52,I read Muslims and was confused why she was talking about their tears because I don‚Äôt think they are known for crying much.
53,Why would you capitalize muslin?
54,[removed]
55,r/facepalm
56,We all read that wrong because it was true...and we were all correct üò∂
57,My man has a bit of a complex. Maybe he should stay away from TV and get out a bit
58,What are muslins?
59,Microcosm for social media today. A bunch of underachieving losers looking for something to be offended about instead of getting off their asses and doing something productive.
60,What a pretentious dickbag. That's embarrassing.
61,got em!
62,This guy is ~~chronically~~ extremely online
63,"People often get offended, before they even think about, what they just read."
64,"She originally had it as 'Muslims' but the artificial intelligence 'corrected' it so that the Muslims wouldn't kill her.  

A.I. cares."
65,I mean just because one muslin turned out bad doesn't mean its all bad...Bangladesh and Iraq are known for great muslins since centuries
66,The left are the most racists ones
67,"Hot take but do you think Muslims are constantly trying to defend themselves because they're fucked up or is it really because they're being painted as this criminal when they really aren't?

I understand that ""fundamentally"" their religion doesn't condone all this fucked up shit that they're known for. But does it really matter if all of those problematic things they're known for are the popular things they're known for? 

Genuinely curious.

Edit: no need to upvote this comment. This is only to start a narrative to educate ignorant people like me and hateful people who are also ignorant to the issue. I would just like to start a narrative to inform people."
68,Some muslins are really soft. Also the Wright flyer was built with muslin so that‚Äôs pretty awesome actually.
69,r/BoneAppleTea
70,Oh so its ok to hate on different fabrics now? Fabricophobe
71,as a muslins i find this funny üòÜ
72,"At the same time, why did she capitalize it?"
73,When you are so use to play the victim.
74,"In fairness, most bigots on Twitter post nonsensical, misspelled crap like this all the time. Like they're trying to parrot whatever a right-wing pundit said but they don't fully understand what the words actually mean or how they're spelled so they try to replicate the quote or sentiment but can't quite get it right and it comes out sounding like ""THE MEXICANILY COMES OVER HERE FROM DEMO-RATS LAND AND GIVES INCONFRUITABLE EVIDENCE OF THERE GROSS MISCONDUIT SO WE HAVE TO PAY WITH OUR ITEMIZED RECEIPTS."""
75,Hol'up but reverse
76,"Yeah fuck em! But how else are you gonna get cheese, ya know?"
77,"I like the recommendation to say ""digital hail mary's"""
78,"When I read ""Fuck Muslins"" I thought the person had a typo and was gonna be made fun of it"
79,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
80,That's one of my exes. Small world!
81,As a Muslim that shit gave me emotional damage üíÄ
82,See?  That guy tore too easily.  He needed to be more elastic.
83,"How many people read ""Muslims""


I did"
84,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
85,I mean... He thought he read hate speech.. that's a pretty good and calm response
86,Ayo
87,In his defence I also read that N as an M before I gave it a second read
88,I didnt know smthing like that exists-
89,So was he?
90,My last brain cell failing to read N.
91,Lmao
92,Ok my wife has been wanting these muslin sheets and they are expensive. I wonder if there is any legitimacy to her complaints.
93,Why did she capitalize muslin though
94,"dude shoulda replied ‚Äú I know, i think it‚Äôs a good fabric‚Äù"
95,People often get explosive on Twitter.
96,Sounds like my Muslin uncle
97,What if he was talking about the fabric too?
98,CAN CONFIRM.  AM MUSLIN.
99,I can understand where the guy is coming from. Most racists online struggle with basic spelling and punctuation
100,I gotta be honest i too read it as muslims
