1,"Tried, didn‚Äôt Work. Now I have one more ex. Thanks"
2,Clorophorm has a 100% success rate of de-escalating any argument.
3,"Tell her to calm down, that always works too."
4,"‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt have an ex‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúNot yet‚Äù"
5,And if that doesn‚Äôt work tell her she is acting like her mother.  She will instantly realize the error of her actions and apologize to you üßê

7,"Yeah and her reply is always. ""Dont compare me to other women. Then my response is ""dont act like other women and i wont""."

11,"""are you on your period again?"""
12,RIP
13,"You just turned her into an angry ex, problem solved!"
14,I'm going to try this on my wife brb
15,Is this advise on how to become single again?
16,"you didn't tell me you had an ex!  


I do now!!"
17,"""Your mother"" is also a suitable replacement"
18,Just calmly argue why she is wrong and explain it in great detail to avoid misunderstandings. /s
19,"Her - You don't an ex

Me - I don't even have a girlfriend"
20,Well yes she cant be you angry girlfriend if she isn't your girlfriend
21,"More like "" How to get yourself murdered"""
22,"""You're acting like my ex who has been missing for the last two years"""
23,It works like a charm. Just ignore the concussion side effect.
24,Works every time without fail. Another relationship saver is telling them to calm down and chill out. Works every time
25,I'm gonna try it.ü§û
26,"Just tell her ""Stop. You're turning me on."" And whatever her response is say ""It's not my fault you are so hot."""

34,"'y'know she's dead now, don't you"
35,Awesome
36,Just like my crazy ex*
37,"Works and 100% effective, only 20% of the time."
38,Inb4 'yes I am. I'm your ex.' and she flees cackling madly. Then you're suddenly a frog.
39,I always found the doctor evil approach works the best for me
40,"\- Didn‚Äôt you say you‚Äôve never dated before?

\- Yeah, that‚Äôs the point."
41,she is ur ex
42,"Uy, that's a foul. Haha"
43,*record stops*
44,Haha. Thy meme is truer then true
45,"Oh yeah, that‚Äôll definitely work‚Ä¶wink winkü§£ü§£"
46,Why does it feel like this advice came from Wikihow ?üóøüñêüíÄ
47,"‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what I like about you, cuz you look just like her too‚Äù"
48,"Yea, go ahead and try that one, buddy."
49,![gif](giphy|SLIkWYTJGcXfi)
50,"You can also substitute ""your mother"""
51,"Funny. I only threaten to act like his ex whenever he acts like mine. I mean, by walking out... does that count?"
52,Husbands hate him (learn how this guy became single in one single step)
53,"Just tell her ""Stop. You're turning me on."" And whatever her response is say ""It's not my fault you are so hot."""
54,"If I wanted to be abused like this, I would've stayed married."
55,PMS?
56,Tell her to take a little time to be quiet. Always works
57,You put the ex in sex.
58,"At least you made it more likely your future girlfriends will act like one of your ex's. 

So better luck next time?"
59,I'd say it worked like a charm then
60,GHB also worked out fine.
61,"Downward escalators have the same effect, just take her to the mall.

Might be pricier though."
62,Try burundanga too a friend told me it works
63,Try just reminding her that whatever she is upset about isn't that significant.
64,"Great advice my friend I‚Äôll definitely try it out later

My girl is angrier then almost getting first place in a Mario kart race and getting blue shelled 5 ft from the finish line"
65,Note: results not guaranteed on the first try
66,"Also make sure to call her a cunt, they love that"
67,"Just tell her to stop acting like a crazy person, she will definitely calm down after that"
68,![gif](giphy|tF8vMUeGUkHNTgCC4E)
69,"Let's be fair...
Girlfriend of advice giver: non-existent."
70,How‚Äôd it go?
71,"You're on Reddit, you do not need advice on that topic"

74,I put the sex in ex
75,"Ever tried a bullet ? Works well, works once.

![gif](giphy|cdNSp4L5vCU7aQrYnV|downsized)"
76,Or down the upward escalator for more dramatic effect.
77,Or ask her if it is *that* time of month.
78,Unless she is Hispanic
79,It probably isn't.
80,Tbf that makes even the gentlest of souls turn into a fucking rage monster in a microsecond
81,"And then proceed to list our crazy people that she is starting to remind you of, including her own mother"
82,"I have no idea, I don't have a wife"
83,Tell her she sounds like her mom.
84,"I had a friend wager a round of drinks on a mariokart race once...she beat me by only a few inches, still had a blue shell sitting in reserve if I got fresh with her and was going to win. She is still one of my best friends though."
85,And then say how other girls don't act crazy like her
86,Can confirm. Tried this on the wife and it deifnately stopped the argument. Im sleeping in the couch for 3 days now.
87,![gif](giphy|1hMk0bfsSrG32Nhd5K)
88,Like her best friend for example
89,Fuck yeah üòé  can finally catch up on your soaps without nagging
90,Not to mention finally getting to have a blanket!
