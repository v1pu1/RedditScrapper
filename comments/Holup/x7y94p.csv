1,"Yeah, pani puri. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panipuri

Crispy fried shells filled with flavored water. A bizarre mixture of wet and crunchy, not one of my favorite Indian snacks."
2,WATER BALLS!
3,Water balls is maybe not the best description. True though
4,Chest nuts?
5,"Pani batashe, puchka kuchh bhi keh lo isme bhonchakka kyu ho rhe hai"
6,"Next up, japan, known for it's raw fish and rice, or boiled flour with flavoured water!"
7,"if your pani puri tastes like flavored water you’re doing something wrong 

i would describe it as more of a sauce or a chutney. and it’s not even the only thing in it; we top them with onions, chaat, cilantro, and rly whatever else you want"
