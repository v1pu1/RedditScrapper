30,"[Meet the Demoman Title Card]

[Opening fanfare of Drunken Pipe Bomb plays as the Demoman narrowly escapes a massive explosion while jumping from a drop-down corridor in Gravel Pit.]

[Freeze frame]

Demoman: ""What makes me a good Demoman?""

[Cut to Demoman, sitting in a room full of explosives.]

Demoman: ""If I were a bad Demoman, I wouldn't be sittin' here, discussin' it with you now would I?""

[""Drunken Pipe Bomb"" resumes playing]

[Demoman charges into battle along with Team RED while dodging a cascade of rockets.]

Demoman: ""Let's do it!""

Demoman: ""Not one of ya's gonna' survive this.""

[Cut back to the Demoman's room, music pauses.]

Demoman: ""One crossed wire, one wayward pinch of potassium chlorate, one errant twitch... and kablooie!""

[Cut back to battle, music resumes.]

[The Demoman bounces a grenade off a wall and gibs a pursuing Pyro.]

[Cut to scene of the Demoman chugging from his Bottle of scrumpy.]

[A level 2 Sentry Gun upgrades to level 3.]

[Cut to scene of the Demoman continuing to chug from his Bottle of scrumpy.]

[Sentry Gun fires rockets at the Demoman.]

[Cut to a close up of the Demoman's face, still chugging from his Bottle of scrumpy.]

[The Demoman dodges the rockets as a nearby Scout is gunned down by the Sentry. The Demoman then fires two grenades, destroying the Sentry Gun.]

[Cut back to Demoman's room, music stops.]

[The Demoman slams the now empty Bottle down on the table, breathing heavily.]

[Camera blurs.]

Demoman: ""I got a manky eye. I'm a black, Scottish cyclops.""

[The Demoman knocks a grenade off the table, arming it in the process (it begins to blink).]

Demoman: They've got more f-[long censored]-s than they've got the likes of me.""

[The Demoman starts to drink from the empty Bottle, then notices the camera and becomes lucid again.]

Demoman: ""So....""

[The ending segment of ""Drunken Pipe Bomb"" starts to play.]

Demoman: ""...T'all you fine dandies so proud, so cocksure.""

[The Demoman runs out to the final capture point in Gravelpit and is shocked to see a group of BLU team members charging towards him with smug expressions on their faces. A devious look comes over the Demoman's face and he runs with BLU in hot pursuit.]

Demoman: ""Prancin' aboot with your heads full of eyeballs! Come and get me I say! [The Demoman passes a door frame and covers it in sticky bombs] I'll be waiting on ya with a whiff of the 'ol brimstone. I'm a grim bloody fable... with an unhappy bloody end!""

[The Heavy notices the sticky bombs around the door frame, and his expression changes from smugness to one of shock. The Demoman throws a mock salute and activates the sticky bombs, gibbing all his pursuers.]

[The Demoman walks up to (presumably) a decapitated head, laughing merrily as body parts and blood rain down around him.]

Demoman: ""Oh, they're going to have to glue you back together... in hell!""

[Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, accompanied by bagpipes.]"
31,"Tststs
Tsutdutsu
Ksisk kisk kisk"
32,"Don't grate it in the grinder, son!"
33,"
I read that in butcher's voice"
34,Can confirm.
35,Scotland for the win!
36,Michi michi michitooo
37,It is the sound a nest of baby birds make. They just can‚Äôt resist checking it out. They might miss an easy kill/ snack.
38,"In El Salvador we say, ‚ÄúVenite, Hue puta!‚Äù"
39,"Works for kids, friends, and the ladies~"
40,![gif](giphy|RXOytL7OSgOPYU98bC|downsized)
41,"In Thailand it's meow meow, pspsps is reserved for dogs. When they're not trying to kick them."
42,it's weird that im the only one calling them by holding tongue like trying to 'n' then say 'ce' while holding 'n'... am i the only one?
43,I just chase and pick them up. Sometimes
44,Test
45,"In Germany we say ""k-k-k"""
46,"I usually suck the air out of my mouth to create a vacuum and then slightly open the tip of my lips, you look like shit while doing it so you better cover your face with your hand but it works very well for both cats and dogs. 
I can do this at my door at night and my cats often come back (rural area and they often come like 5 min after i start to make the sound so my guess is that they're sometimes kilometers away and still hear it.)

For dogs as soon as they hear it they come to me.

This works for my dogs and cats as they are used to the signal, but if i do it do a random cat he just look at me most of the time. 
Probably a frequency somewhat close to little prey, and i'll guess that there is also less sonor pollution at those frequencies so they can directly know where it comes from and who it is."
47,"Yes lol I call my cat a c nt too, usually when he decides to go tearing into my food when I'm prepping for dinner, but it's said in a loving way that only Scots can pull off"
48,"I'm a guy from the midwest. Myself, and several farmers I've known call cats by saying ""HERE KATTAY KITTAY!!!"" in a very high pitched voice... I've never called a cat by going pspsps. Lol!
Anyone else do this???"
49,"One of our cats is not too bright. You call her name? She just sits there. You call her in the high pitched sweet voice? Doesn‚Äôt even turn her head. One time I‚Äôm sitting there calling the stupid cat, ‚ÄúAdora. Come here Adora. Pspspsps.‚Äù Nothing. My sons says, ‚ÄúYa. Adora doesn‚Äôt do pspsps.‚Äù And now it‚Äôs a joke with us. We still say pspsps knowing she is totally clueless."
50,Ah me willies gonna come inside o you- What the Scottish say to sheep

55,"Yes, it's upside-down, with Australia, so everything is switched around, sounds logical to me."
56,What bout lads?
57,"Right. Well, you‚Äôre upside down, aren‚Äôcha?"
58,Reddit just told me that some mate reported me and that calling someone GC is harassment. Can't even be a Kiwi on the internet.
59,"Proper stole that off us Aussies tho. The lamington, too"
60,"ah yes, confederaci√≥n nacional del trabajo"
61,"So they spell 'cat' with an N instead of an A? 

That sounds like something the Welsh would do, with their disdain of vowels."
62,Same in Australia
63,"Should it be more like: ‚ÄúOI YA BLOODY GIMP, GET DAT ARSE OVER HERE!‚Äù"
64,"If the cat is from Scotland,  yes."
65,"German always works!

Edit: [Here's the reference.](https://youtu.be/mp5cV_6mVLQ)"
66,"Clasic, haha"
67,This is the most awkward and embarassing way to call a pet over imo
68,"My cat knows what I want by the number of kisses. 2 kisses means came for pets, 3 means tasty food, etc."
69,"I can imagine the fun you could have with English speakers there. 

""What city are you from?""
""We're all Cunts here.""

For someone who used to live there:
""Where are you from?""
""My mother's Cunt."" 

The trolling possibilities are endless!"
70,Jamais entendu √ßa de ma vie
71,"If you had foreigners trying to kick you off your island every few years until they caught half of it, you'd be pretty cantankerous too"
72,Though we have big kitties so...üòÖ
73,Well the original post is also about the Uk. So which is true ?
74,Where do you think Scotland is?!
75,Ahh the old Scottish Londoner.
76,"Yes‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the only one, mate."

78,"You speak Scottish, AND English? Impressive."
79,"Nanomachines son, they harden in response to physical trauma"
80,ENGARISH MUDAPHUKAH DO YOU SPEAKA ITA!?
81,"All of Germany: speaking Hochdeutsch. ""Guten Tag, wie geht's es Ihnen?""

Bavaria: ""Guadn Moang, wia g√§d 's ihna"" 

You can't Tell me, that this is a dialect. This is a whole different language!"
82,So I‚Äôm a cunt to you..? _Rude_
83,[deleted]
84,"That‚Äôs more a British thing. I lived in NZ for years and you‚Äôd usually only really hear it said to young boys. In the UK, it‚Äôs more widely used."
85,I was. I‚Äôve been right side up for many years now.
86,"That disdain for vowels seems to be the Welsh way of being passive aggressive with the English and the clerks who work for the UK government who had to collect the initial spelling of Welsh place names. I can say the same about the passive aggressiveness with Irish given names. Have you seen some of the Irish names? Aiofe (E-fa), Eoghan (Owen), Saoirse (Sir-sha is Saoirse Ronin's; idk the common pronunciation).

Half the Welsh place names and half the Irish names are spelled in a way that make no sense in easily pronouncing them in British English and don't seem to have any rhyme nor reason behind it other than the messed them about. I believe this could continue on in Scotland, but I've never had a chance to look into the etymology of the Scottish linguistic style which would meet this thesis of my theory. Though come to think on it, the pronunciation of the Glaswegian language is quite the character itself when it comes to restricting how English ears to understand what is said.

All I know is what I've been told by people from the UK who would be offended being mistakenly told they sound British \[English\] if they were Aussies, Scots, Welsh, Irish, etc. When you have a certain section of the population treated as lower class citizens and they feel powerless due to learned helplessness and institutional poverty. You've gotta rebel somehow, and not all people choose the default course."
87,"seems reasonable, with city names such as llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwlllantysiliogogogoch"
88,Ty for this link!!! Love it!!
89,"Idc, it works. I can pet all the dogs and cats!"
90,"C'est pas une v√©rit√© absolue non plus, mais dans mon foyer nous disons ceci."
91,The sound of a zipper is scarier to a Welsh sheep than anything else.
92,"Makes me think of the Doctor Who Red Day skit with David Tennant and Catherine Tate in a school setting. ""Are you speaking Scottish or English now?"" Catherine's Lauren Cooper is so cheeky."
93,"Not really it's quite similar to English with a few words changed to Scots, it's just the way you speak it, all about the tongue"
94,So do masochists.
95,WHAT DOES MARSELLUS WALLACE LOOK LIKE?!
96,"Und des schene Schwabel√§ndle redet ned andes, ne?

Aber ehrlich jetzt, kein Freistaat spricht nur Hochdeutsch, die meisten reden dialekt."
97,I‚Äôm dutch so yes we‚Äôre *rude*
98,"Never said it was. It's rather near, though."
99,It's pretty much just the West island.
100,It helps the Irish are Fae born and so didn't start off with Latin or German as a base. I've no clue where French comes from it messes with my head something fierce though.
