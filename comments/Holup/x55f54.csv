1,Reminds me of the Space Jam Halloween costumes where white people were advertised in only Tune Squad and Black people were only advertised in Goon Squad.

26,"Coincidence, stfu"
27,This is wrong on so many levels but also funny and I hope that this was unintentional.
28,meanwhile Lebrone jame
29,Really?
30,Well done you didn't get banned for no reason( it's a joke for god sake)
31,Racists often compare black people to monkeys.
32,No they didn't
33,One might argue itâ€™s mildly racist to see something wrong with it. That being said I do see where you are coming from.
34,Kids this young don't know what racism is.  Let the kids enjoy their childhood and dress up as monkeys if they want to.   People who want this to be a racial thing are just trying to pick a fight.
35,What's wrong with it? Do you compare black people to monkeys?
36,Takes one to know one.
37,It amazes me when people think this is fine.  Like they canâ€™t see it goes back to how slave owners saw their slaves.  Comparing people to animals is gross.
38,So that means i dont exist.......
39,Itâ€™s a kid in a costume.
40,Itâ€™s from Swedish H&M.
41,I also believe the term porch monkey can be saved.
42,If you think this is racist that is your own prejudice
43,r/theyknew
44,What is that LeBron thing ?
45,Yeah
46,Why?
47,I donâ€™t know why your getting downvoted thatâ€™s literally the joke
48,oh nvm then
49,"I call my children little monkeys all the time, there is nothing wrong with likening children to cute animals, this image is only an issue because its been used as a racial insult in the past by horrid people."
50,Uhmmm actchuallee humans are animals ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
51,"Comparing people to animals isn't gross. People literally are animals from a biological point of view.

Besides, I'm pretty sure my wife wouldn't see anything wrong with this, because she'd never compare black people to monkeys. I'm confident I'd have to tell her why people might find this offensive. Just because people don't see a problem with it doesn't mean they're racist. Sometimes it just means they're not racist enough to even see it."
52,Lerone
53,Itâ€˜s an assumed missing link and appearance thing
54,Black>africa>monkey
55,"Because racists are usually pretty fucking stupid, and don't often dabble in science."
56,"Humans are primates, so it's fitting to compare them to apes and monkeys; kids especially."
57,"The theory of evolution is actually pretty racist. Remember all the illustrations and photos in the science textbooks showing the progression from apes to ""ancient humans"" (all dark skinned with facial features derived from native Africans)? Then the further progression to ""modern humans"", who were always Caucasian? Pepperidge Farm remembers."
58,"The *appropriation* of the theory has most definitely been, at times, vehemently racist."
