12,"YouTube just doesn't give a damn anymore. When you search anything, it shows you what it thinks you want to see, not what you LITERALLY searched.

That said, what have you been looking at that would trigger the algorithm towards ""cow vagina""?"
13,![gif](giphy|dOl2LFw0RbTMc)
14,"I know, right? Who wants to see anything about vegans?"
15,"Do you understand why you lost now America?

38,"I watched that video. It mentions that it takes over 10 hours to deodorize. I just want to ask why anyone would eat something that takes 10 hours to just get a putrid scent out? A good portion of the video is just cleaning too, with aggressive scrubbing and washing with dish soap."

51,Whenever I see something like this it makes me think of how youtube/Google algorithm is pretty accurate at showing things related to what you have previously looked at...
52,NO I WENT TO LEAVE THE PHOTO AND IT ZOOMED IN OH GOD

63,Oh god no
64,"I'm Vietnamese, never heard of this shit, wtf"
65,Don't knock it before you've tried it. I've never eaten cow vagina but if people are eating it then it probably tasted decent. I'd try it if someone cooked it for me.
66,"Might have lost your appetite for food, but has given you an appetite for something else hu buddy"
67,How do u not know how to grill a chicken tho u literally just put it on there

89,Nothing as horrible as this. Lol
90,"I just typed that in knowing it would have some good chicken recipes but it was stuff I already knew. Turned out pretty good, like another user said it goes from cheese to a fucking cows vegg. It’s horrifying"
