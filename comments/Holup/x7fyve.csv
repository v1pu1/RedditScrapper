10,"It's fake. It's Islamophobic propaganda spread by the extreme-right parties in Indian politics. ""Nupur Sharma"" top left was a member of the BJP (a right-wing party in India) who made objectionable comments about Islam. The BJP is well-known for inciting violence in India through its Islamophobic comments (99% of the party members are like Marjorie Taylor Greene on steroids)."

58,"Even though this might be satire, it's somewhat believable because incest is a serious problem for Pakistanis."
59,Wtf
60,"I don't know many Alabaman's that would wear that. Definitely Middle Eastern. In fact, incest is wayyyyyy more common over there than Alabama."

86,"What load of BS! Nupur Sharma said only what is mentioned in the hadeez and EXACTLY what zakir naik has been yammering. 

Clear attempt to pelt fake stuff here cuz people won't take the pains to google it out eh? 

  


If your claim had been true, then Looking at what the muslims been doing of late, the whole country should have been up in flames - 

  


The whole GyanVapi and other places where the holiest of the places are without a doubt being held just cuz once occupied, always occupied

  


The Shooting of a girl in Delhi, in ballabhgarh, rajasthan girl raped n hung from a tree, another threatened, acid attack murder - all by muslims wanting them to convert

  


The riots in Delhi by muslim mob where petrol bombs were hurled on the police

  


The regular streaming in of the rohingyas and bangladeshis

  


The beheadings when all that was said is there in the hadeez

  


The dargah chistis offering bribes to kill

  


Munawwar faruqi openly insulting Hindu dieties 

  
Zubair pelting selective bits to incite mob attacks


Faruqi also mocked the dead people who were torched by a muslim mob while sitting inside a train coach & doing nothing untoward 

  


The PFI rally where the kid was telling Hindus & Christians to live 'properly' among muslims 

  


The fatwas against those Muslims who sang a song in praise of Lord Krishna or just bringing in idol of Lord Ganesh

  


The 'violence inciting' by '99%' BJP is still awaited."

88,Yeah same for Israel.

92,"

In fact, there is more profanity there than in Alabama."

97,"nice documentary

Wonder how it is now, after the retreat of the US"
98,"I really like how you emphasize *those* countries, the vast majority of the comments know it's a joke and just play along. Meanwhile you got one chance to be racist and you snatched it like a hungry dog waiting to be fed."
99,"I guarantee the only thing you know about ""these countries"" is the propaganda you see on fox news."
100,But it's not happening. It is fake.
