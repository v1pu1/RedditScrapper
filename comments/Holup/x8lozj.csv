5,"I would like to say, and please correct me if I am wrong, but mixed libido relationships tend... to not flourish."

7,"Most of time, those do not flourish, indeed. But I've seen some cases where sex wasn't the major issue for the couple. My mom, for example, have been living with my step dad for about 16 years or so now. They never really cared about this part. They're more focused in hobbies, practicing sports together, enjoying good food... I actually asked her about it, out of curiosity, and she confirmed. Sex never was the priority for both of them."
8,"Seems like they're both ace, or at least leaning more on that side of the spectrum regarding libido.

From what I understand, as well as personal experiences, mixed libidos only matters to the one that has the higher drive. It really is one-sided, and not much can be done to alleviate such a strong biological desire and sometimes it's simply a straight up biological need.

I feel like I would know, as I'm the sexual one in the mixed libido marriage."
9,"I'm quite sure my mom is, based in conversations we had about her past relationships. While she didn't even care about deep kisses, my dad is the kind of person that values sex *a lot*. Coming to think about it, maybe that's one of the reasons they broke up in first place."
10,It's a rough place to be.
