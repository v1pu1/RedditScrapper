1,And the parents are upset not because they did this without permission but because they missed the ceremony? It’s a rare double fruitcake!
2,"at least they werent indoctrinating them. 

oh wait."
3,I’d sue the fuck outah that school and I’m not even an atheist.
4,"I swear their holy book says something about not baptizing children. There's nothing about infants either since its assumed they can't understand what's going on.

Mark 10:13-16 mentions Jesus blessing children, but there is no mention of water. 

Gotta love how they're forcing children to take a step of obedience but also the same type of people to get mad at the left for ""indoctrinating"" their kids."
5,This is part of the reason I don't want my tax dollars diverted from public schools to private and charter schools.  Practice religion on your own time and your own dime.
6,Let’s make all the children in a christian school go hail satan and watch the melting
7,At least it wasn't circumcisions...
8,I don't want to live on this planet anymore
9,"I mean, it’s a catholic school so I guess it’s not like religious ceremonies there are out of place. But a baptism is probably something your family wants to be there to celebrate with you.

I also feel that the “schools are grooming and brainwashing our children” crowd would have a very different reaction if a different religion did something remotely similar."
10,Once again the “persecuted Christian’s” shoving their belief down children’s throats but think the teaching of accurate history is indoctrination.
11,Reminds me of that Simpsons episode where Flanders is going to baptize Bart and Lisa
12,So schools will do this without parents consent but have to give consent so their child can learn about history? They dont see a problem with this?
13,"> our lawyer said kids can't give consent, so we went along with it!"
14,I'd be baptizing some motherfuckers with these hands.
15,"I mean... They're literally paying to send them to the private Christian school. What else did they expect?


They aren't even mad for the right reasons. This is clickbait."
16,"It's a private Christian school 

Fruitcakes sent their kids to fruitcake school, and are shocked that their kids got fruitcaked."
17,"I’ll be a bit upset but since it’s just water (atheist), I probably won’t bother making a big deal out of this.  Would definitely consider transfer my kid to other school though."
18,The amount of hell I would raise as one of the parents....those Christians would think their apocalypse had finally come. How dare they?
19,Absolute degenerates.
20,"The parental response would invoke some reference to “separation” “church” “state” if it were anything other than Christian baptism. You can bet if it were Hindu, Jewish, Islamic, or any other religion, the “inquisition” would already have started."
21,"Who's forcing what on who now? Oh, right. Christians always just project their dirty tactics on everyone else."
22,"These churches need to be banned because there is no god; they only do this to get more money, giving minions. Please vote to ban relations in government. All government offices need to be manned by nonreligious persons.   Catholicism is the most horrid religion of all and needs to be cast out of every country."
23,"Imagine the shitstorm if this was children being taught uncomfortable history or scientific knowledge.

Oh wait..."
24,"Next on the agenda:  The school is going to have a ""Circumcision Surprise Day"".  Don't tell the parents about it, it's a surprise!"
25,"Fayetteville Observer? That is the ""big city"" where all the food and shopping is. I grew up in Robeson Co which is arguably worse. 

This kind of shit doesn't surprise me. The school thinks they saved lives and realized they have just abused their rights 1000x over. It's an incredible abuse of power and I would be getting lawyers. Then again who would think a church school wouldn't do this?

We moved about 400 miles north of there just to get our kids out of the state. I'm honestly literally scared of raising my kids where I was raised due to the ... Well the maga bleed over into everyday life that I am absolutely not okay with."
26,This was done by a [private Christian school](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwood_Temple_Academy). Articles seem to have omitted this detail in order to stir up controversy.
27,"According to the article,  parents weren't so much upset about the baptism as the fact they weren't able to be present for it."
28,who gave them the right to do that?
29,"My daughter went to church with a friend when she was little. It was some sort of pot luck thing so I figured why not. Come to find out, the parents of my daughters friend got my daughter baptized and my wife and I had no idea. I only found out a few months ago and this apparently happened years ago. I’m still angry about it."
30,"As a parent of one of these children, I would literally sue the school into oblivion.  To have a school arbitrarily assume they have the right to baptize my child without warning, notice or permission is egregious."
31,"*puts kids in a private Christian school*

*gets mad when they do Christian things*"
32,"This is a private Baptist school it is based on religion this isn't exactly a public tax funded school, kinda crazy u send your kid to learn about Jesus and how dinosaurs were never here and they get baptized and that is the line"
33,I would burn the school down
34,So I’m a Christian and wtf lol. That’s such a weird and totally inappropriate thing to do. Not every child or family is religious. That’s so messed up to me.
35,Cant wait for episode 2: surprise circumcision
36,Props for letting them do it with their clothes on I know the church wouldn’t hesitate for a chance of seeing a kid naked
37,The pissed I'd be...but I'd never let my kid go to a school affiliated with a church or religion. That is where they went wrong right there.
38,Yuck. Gross.
39,"It's a private Christian school, guys."
40,"As an atheist, the magic water is not going to harm them. just a fun if stupid activity for them. I would be more worried about what random bull plop they are being told is facts.

But I can see people from other religions getting really pissy about this."
41,"That was done to me in the 1980s when I was about six or seven - not by some nutter religious academy but at a public school in Louisiana. Not surprisingly, it factors pretty heavily into why I’m an atheist."
42,Hit those people with some water and tell them they've been baptized into the Satanic Church.
43,"""Alright kids we're all going swimming today, just jump on in there...^IbaptizeyouinthenameoftheFathertheSon,andtheHolySpirit"""
44,"I think if I was forcibly baptized at that age I would just be confused. I knew at that age that my family was Jewish and that things associated with Jesus were just the crazy things the gentiles do.

If anything, I think I would just be upset that I had to be dunked in water in the middle of the school day."
45,I wouldn't be too concerned... they will still end up in the worm farm the same as everyone else..
46,"They don't tell you they're baptizing your kids, next they don't tell you they're having Kool Aid in class.

Stuff like this is especially creepy. Most of these parents are upset this happened because they couldn't attend, not because they're atheist or Muslim or other religion for which you wouldn't be baptized. Do they understand how terrifying that is? If the parents of these children are largely ""Yes baptism"" then *why*, for what reason would you possibly have to *not* tell them you are baptizing their children? 

Call me an extremist but this gives me doomsday vibes, like whoever is in charge wants to make sure these kids get into heaven because they believe something is going to happen, soon, before these kids get the chance to be ready to be baptized. 

Is no one else seriously concerned for the safety of these kids? Is this not a big deal to anyone else?"
47,Is this the grooming the neofascists keep alluding to?
48,link
49,We need to know if it was a public school. If you send your kid to a Christian school wtf do you expect to happen?
50,"""That's okay, sweetie, we can just rinse it off with some Moon Water with herbs and black salt."" 

Jokes on them, too, baptism doesn't count unless you've accepted Jesus into your heart first. Checkmate, theists!!"
51,I'd imagine and hope there will be some legal action for this. But the Carolinas are kind of known to be extremely conservative and religious. I know I'd sue.
52,Law suits to oblivion.
53,"Private Christian school. Still fucked up, but not for the same reasons."
54,PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL***
55,I would be lawyering up immediately.
56,Bitch could've taken a picture of the article instead of a bunch of links
57,"The /r/Christianity thread on this is a total mess btw. Most are horrified but then there's a bunch of them defending it as a good thing, and a lot of them with no grasp of the most basic theology around baptism. Fascinating really."
58,That could be consider assault which could get the teachers on a list and the school closed
59,Oh fuck no. Lawsuit.
60,"It was a private religious school which, while it doesn't justify it by any means, that bit of context at least sheds a good bit of light on the issue."
61,So how exactly does dunking your head in water 3 times mean that you're not ashamed for JC's death and why would anyone be ashamed?
62,ThE lAnD oF tHe FrEEEeEeee!!!!!
63,![gif](giphy|ypX8YZszkIXFC|downsized)
64,r/leopardsatemyface
65,Start your day with Dunkin'
66,Fruicake parents get fruitcaked
67,It was a private christian school tbh thats really fucked up you know the kids parents are christians you know the kids will be baptized with their parents there and you take it away from the family's hands now its just done
68,Consent sold seperatly
69,"This is a click-bait headline. The school is not a public school, it's a private Christian school. The complaining parents are upset they missed the baptism ceremony."
70,At least its all fake bullshit. At the end of the day some weird fucker getting kids wet isn't gonna make these kids religious.
71,Oh they are. The parents pay extra for that service.
72,The parents were mostly upset they weren't invited so they could see it.
73,BuT wHat aBoUT ReLIgiOUs FreEdOm 🫠
74,"It's literally a private Christian school, so if you choose to send your kids there you can't really sue them for doing religious stuff. The parents in this case are just upset they missed the ceremony, not that the kids were baptized at all."
75,"private Christian school

Fruitcakes sent their kids to fruitcake school, and are shocked that their kids got fruitcaked."
76,Heads would roll...
77,"Luckily, pointless rituals are pointless, and have no bearing on actual reality.  Theses people may believe some weird shit though, and that can make them do weird things."
78,"Please don’t act like the majority of American Christians have even read the Bible, let alone actually follow what it says."
79,"Read about Anabaptists. Fundamentalists, but their ideas about baptism were right"
80,These uh. These WERE the students of a christian school.
81,">> At least it wasn't circumcisions...

Not yet. Rest assured that your local Republicans are working on legalizing it though."
82,"I’m going to be honest, I completely forgot which word means what, since this isn’t my first language. I remembered at first that this meant circumcising. So I was a bit relieved after rethinking it. Would still be angry in this situation though"
83,"If it makes you feel better, this was a private Christian school. The parents are just upset about missing the ceremony.

Indoctrinating kids is messed up in the first place, but as long as religious schools are legal, you can't really complain that kids sent to a religious school were subjected to religious rituals."
84,Me neither _thighten the rope on my neck_
85,"*Pentecostal, not Catholic."
86,It's not normal to randomly baptise a child when neither the child or the parents are giving actual consent to do so.
87,Fuck no! These are Pentecostals. Make Catholics look like normies
88,I agree.  Baptisms are very important to family members.  I am not religious myself but I make a point to attend them for friends and family that are religious. The fact that this seems slapped together with a severe lack of coordination/communication is asking to piss off everyone involved.
89,It was a private Christian school not public
90,The baptism itself isn’t the main issue. The kids are soggy. The first amendment protection against government promoting a specific religion is the problem.
91,"*The amount of hell*

*I would raise as one of the*

*Parents. How dare they?*

92,And if it weren't in a Christian private school lol
93,It’s a Christian school…
94,"That's an EXTREMELY important detail, thank you!"
95,"It seems pretty obvious given that the school is called Temple Academy 😂. I'm guessing if you voluntarily send your kid to a Christian school, you'd be fine with them getting baptized. I'm all for separation of church and state but I agree, this just seems like a whole lot of clickbait."
96,Still a violation of the right to religious freedom and therefore very much illegal.
97,"Holy crap!

So to speak."
98,Wine. Jesus snuck into the storeroom.

100,"It was a private Christian School. Parents were upset they weren't informed because that kind of thing is somewhat of a big deal and done with family members

Apparently they had a baptism scheduled for a couple kids, and then other kids wanted to get baptized to and they went ahead and did it"
