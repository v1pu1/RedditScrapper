1,"“It wasn’t right the first time you said it why the hell would it be right the next ten times”

(Also if these people knew anything about the bible they’d know it’s considered blasphemous to try and predict the rapture"
2,that's the night he has scheduled for sex with wife.
3,Neat. 14 days after my 21st bday. I get to drink the fake rapture away
4,"Imagine if all the hateful people that lie about everything and everyone actually did just disappear. Fingers crossed, but I won’t hold my breath."
5,Lol. Another one slated to fail just like the rest. When will they learn? On their deathbeds?
6,Guess you can keep changing the last digit of the year.
7,"1. Thats an ugly ass car

2. I better get some popcorn for september 25th then!"
8,Either the rapture or [Harold Camping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping) coming back from the dead to give us the revised date of the rapture. Both are as equally likely to happen.
9,"Perfect, I’m supposed to turn 35 the 29th. Guess I won’t have to worry about that! Forever young!"
10,Dibs on what's-his-face's private jet if true!
11,"Dang, I'll miss my party on the 28th."
12,"On Sep. 26. 2022 put a sticker over it that says ""wrong again, still here!"""
13,"I fucking wish I had a neighbor like this. I'd troll the shit out of them every time pretending to be all on board and then being like ""the fuck randy, what happened?"". Then starting the cycle over again."
14,Does that mean I will only have to put up with morons like this for 21 more days? If only that were true
15,"The words of Jesus:

At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible. See, I have told you in advance.  
So if they tell you, ‘There He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here He is in the inner rooms,’ **do not believe it**. For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather."
16,I'm pretty sure them predicting the end every time makes Jesus add 5 other years to spite them off
17,Leave the Subaru out of this
