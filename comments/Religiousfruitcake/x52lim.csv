3,"Remember to report 'em, and any other homophobes you see."
4,God doesn't exists so it's kinda hard for him to hate sonething

10,"i hope there is a hell for religious bullies and politicians who get elected based on their beliefs rather than their actions, which also suck donkey balls.  i do hold out hope."
11,I'm sorry his response is just so funny
12,Not really a friend then...good riddance
13,"as a muslim, or at least someone that comes from a muslim family/background, screw him. you deserve better, more accepting friends"
14,"They weren't a friend, then. Lucky to find out now."
15,"That is what I mean when I say Islam transforms people into hate mongers. Muslims will say we follow the religion of peace.
Peaceful only if you follow the rules and don‚Äôt be somebody frowned upon like homosexuals, atheists, emancipated women, intellectuals, free thinkers, members of other religions, apostates and so on."
16,Good riddance
17,Damn and on roblox too
18,"Once in clg during biometric ( our attendance is marked through it )
A guy wore a rainbow colored shirt  (he not part of lgbt , he just bought the shirt)  my muslim friend got handy and using slur on him , gays aren't allowed here , so stepped up and made things calm dowln later he tried to bully me . Me in real life I'm savage so I accidentally roasted him to core and he stopped bulling others ."
19,Good. You don't need like poeple him in your life.
20,"god might not like, i do"
21,Christian hate and islamic hate in a close race to the bottom.
22,"But didn't you even TRY to hear him out though? ""god doesent like gays"" sounds pretty convincing to me"
23,"I wonder why they hate lgbt, i mean their god is genderless which is outside of male or female gender ü§î"
24,The satanic temple looks better every day. Peace and tolerance.
25,"Islam feels an eastern version of Nazi ideology. Hate for the other, death for apostasy, uniforms , attitude towards women as vehicles for reproduction. Use of religion to advance political outcomes. Sigh."
26,Fuck em
27,bro there‚Äôs no evidence god exists bro
28,Good riddance
29,God as per their definition. Definately a narrow minded god who created creatures of all shapes and sizes and also is highly intelligent knowing that some part of gay community won't reduce overall human population ü§°
30,Good riddance
31,And they say the trash doesn't take itself out.
32,It always amazes me how religion makes people think about what other people are doing with their genitals.
33,"Well, according to religion, gay people are stronger than all the gods."
34,"Reminds me of the time when I was playing Jailbreak on Roblox, someone said that I would go to hell for supporting LGBTs, and in response, I called god a fascist. 

(Also if that happens again, report the guy)"

40,"Yeah, and the worst part is she is 12. And is already a homophobe"
41,"But, if god *did* exist, why would it create things it didn't like in the first place?"
42,"Can you be specific as to which God?

Theres thousands of them... all imaginary, mind you."
43,magic sky daddy my ass
44,Jesus is not part of the muslim religion
45,Eew no. I wouldn‚Äôt fuck him if he was the last person alive.
46,"Former Muslim here, Pork and or contact with pigs aren't treated like we'll explode like vampires if we touch garlic or sunlight but is considered ritually unclean and is forbidden to be eaten unless you are starving.

So people dipping say bullets in pigs blood to fight terrorists are honestly playing too hard into their own fantasy and just come off as idiots."
47,No. Heaven is a made up concept.
48,"really a shame to see honestly. imagine being so young but so brainwashed. i hope she grows honestly. and best to luck of you man, proud of you for coming out :)"
49,"‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hate, only the unloved and the unnatural hate‚Äù 

No one is born hating, it‚Äôs taught. Sad that another younger has fallen for the lie. As a young kid I went to school with all colors and religions and didn‚Äôt see anyone as different at all. It was later that we started to trust each other less and only waaay into my adulthood that I realized that every single reason for that came form our parents. It‚Äôs all ignorance and although I recognize that I‚Äôm in a very fortunate position to feel this way; I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs like this"
50,"So he can hate them. Like we make our enemies to tear them down. Would be more humanlike than us, that fucker."
51,"Religious people will tell you it's their choice to follow Satan... like, it's a choice..."
52,I meant all of them
53,Huitzilopochtli
54,"Actually, Jesus is mentioned in Islam but there are some differences between Christian Jesus and Muslim Jesus.

Jesus in the Quran did come in to get rid of the laws of the Torah.

Jesus in Christianity is seen as the son of God and also to be God in human form which Muslims will criticize and say Christianity is a polytheistic religion. Muslims on the other hand believe that Jesus was appointed by God to be a prophet but they don't believe that God impregnated Mary. But the Quran does say that Mary has not had relations with a man so they may believe in a virgin birth maybe.

Muslims also don't believe in the crucifixion.

So yes Muslims do believe in Jesus but don't think he should be worshipped and don't think of him as the son of God."
55,"If he was the last person alive, you wouldn‚Äôt be there."
56,So (as the ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äù) you think that the last two people on earth would be two guys? Thats crazy. I never thought of it that way‚Ä¶.
57,But why did he create Satan?
58,"Just checking, because I'd wager they didn't ask each god. I bet thet s a god of love or nature or something out there that loves gays."
59,I‚Äôm a woman. So it‚Äôd be a man and a woman if it was me
60,"And shouldnt the all powerful god not just be able to... remove satan? 

Or make him not so mean?"
61,Touch√©
62,"It's THE big issue with Christianity, and they have all sorts of narratives for this (test your faith, freedom bc He loves us so much, etc...).


We pastafarians say that the universe (not just the earth) is 3000 years old. Anything you see that looks more than that (pyramids, stars, photons, ground layers, dinosaur bones, the Bible, name it) has been put there to test your faith.

Being rational is not a requirement for religions..."
