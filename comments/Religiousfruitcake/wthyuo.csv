1,He‚Äôs fucking them kids isn‚Äôt he?
2,"if you only have one christian parent, is only one side of your body holy?"
3,"Sounds like something my dad would say. He legit believed that the only people who were actually married were a Catholic man and woman married by a Catholic priest in a Catholic church. Everyone else is just living in sin, doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve been together for 50 years, it doesn‚Äôt count. 

Yeah I don‚Äôt talk to my dad anymore, not since I married my Jewish wife"
4,"This guy is probably a treat at parent teacher conferences:

‚ÄúMr. Suav√© we need to talk about your child, they hit another student in class last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey probably deserved it, my child is holy.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù"
5,"Since ""holy"" is entirely imaginary, sure, why not?"
6,"""This is real, and it matters""
Any evidence?


So, under this framework, converting to Christianity is pointless since holiness is based on birth? 

Also the contradiction between the (at least on-paper) universal sacrifice of Christ (meaning that he died for all of humanity) and the inherent selfishness of claiming that They are the only holy ones is a little baffling."
7,"And if we all keep fighting about religion, all children will be holey!"
8,I thought only Jesus was holey‚Ä¶
9,"jEsUs Is LoVe¬°

![gif](giphy|gXsWCWqBbwHw4)"
10,"This is real, and it really matters, trust me bro"
11,Proof they're not actually pro life
12,"Just another religious bigot  showing how Christianity is immoral. It is amazing how they create new ideas that aren't supported by the written text of their own holy book, typically that separate themselves from the rest of us."
13,"Brian, I sit on a throne of righteousness. You sit on a bar stool of lies."
14,Pretty sure most modern Christian denominations teach that humans are defiled with the Original Sin from the moment of conception. This asshole doesn't know even his own theology BS.
15,"Well, my kids are delightful and have been since conception. And?"
16,"I am a Hindu , we don't kill animal's or drink wine like your God made you to. Guess who's more clean now mf"
17,"Isn‚Äôt your god supposed to make these decisions, or do you think you are better the your god"
18,I don‚Äôt have kids but if I did I don‚Äôt want them to be holy I want them to be intelligent.
19,This guy can piss right the fuck off
20,Tell me about that original sin though..which means everyone has to get baptised otherwise its Hell for you!
21,"I was not convinced at first. Then I read ‚Äúthis is real, and it really matters‚Äù. Suddenly I was like WOAH! and I was convinced in the blink of an eye."
22,"Why are children holy at all, given that they are born in sin which is one of the arguments why we need Jesus? And how can he claim.that anyone is holy in the first place, apart from saints? How does any of this make sense even from within a religious framework?"
23,"OK, and.....so? I'm an atheist who doesn't have any kids, but if I did, I really wouldn't give a damn if they're ""holy"", for what I think are obvious reasons.

Also, what about a kid born to a non-Christian family who decides to become a Christian? Does he become holy, or is he just doomed from the start?"
24,"This is an example of a ""holier than thou"" attitude."
25,And he would lose his absolute shit if a Muslim said that about his religion.
26,"There's been nearly 3000 gods worshiped but the rest are made up nonsense, only the one you follow is real.

Weird innit"
27,Oh look kids‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the American Taliban!
28,He misspelled holey.
29,"Yo, this is what got my second childhood pastor kicked out of our church (my first one got the church disbanded, not sure why). Basically pastor #2 stated that babies go to hell if the parents aren't ""saved."" I would see this POS In the grocery store from time to time as an adult and would avoid him at all costs. Pretty sure his son does, too"
30,"""Yes, the hole in my child's heart from the untreated diabetes my wife has is really a reward from Jesus for our inaction to seek satanic medicine"""
31,There's nothing holy about your kids getting fucked by the bishops.
32,"Then let‚Äôs see some good old fashioned Saint miracles, scrote! Let‚Äôs see those kids fly!"
33,Try to find a religious person who isn‚Äôt racist (difficulty: impossible)
34,I am the main character
35,How does that work Brian?
36,God called my people the chosen ones.  It doesn't get holier than that.
37,"Isn't that completely against what his stupid religion teaches? Like it's literally in the first few pages of the fucking book, so he's clearly a blasphemous dunce."
38,Good thing ‚Äúholy‚Äù is wholly meaningless‚Ä¶
39,"Um. If I remember my Bible correctly, aren't all kids born with the Original Sin thanks to shenanigans at the Garden of Eden and this Original Sin is washed away with baptism? At least this was the reasoning given to me about baptism..."
40,I am glad one religion knows they are the real truth.
41,Some guy said something about not judging lest you be judged but he probably wasn‚Äôt anyone important.
42,"That would seem to be contradicted by the teachings of his own faith, which necessitate baptism to overcome original sin. Too bad his parents didn't hold him under the water longer."
43,That beard hides more than his chin.
44,"Idk man, I believe you but I'll still ask the pope later if that's true"
45,Aren‚Äôt like all children evil until baptism? Like isn‚Äôt that a core tenet of the idea of original sin?
46,"True according to the christian definition 

Doesnt mean it matters or anything"
47,"The delusion of insecurity/ignorance based faith.

They all think they're different, they all think that they're special... they are not."
48,Gotta love a humble Christian with a Messiah complex.
49,Why is your made up fantasy religion so special?
50,No idea who that person is therefore couldn't give a shit less what he thinks.
51,"Sure, whatever you want. 


Holy doesn't mean anything anyway."
52,Brian Sauv√©? More like Brain Saut√©ed
53,"Muslim say this to all the time, growing up I always hear questions from kids what will happen to non Muslim if they die as non Muslim even little kids who died early and the answer is HELL, because only Muslim can enter heaven even if they didn't know what Islam was or too young to know. luckily those people don't have twitter or else they will fight each other"
54,Only the holy ones
55,Holy Fuck!
56,Hence the term 'nailing'.
57,*King Solomon has entered the chat*
58,A REAL CHRISTIAN would never have children with an unholy infidel! /s
59,One side will be holy. The other side banana. You become holy bananas!
60,"That reminds me of that old Family Guy bit where they're at some sort of gathering where there were a lot of Jewish people for whatever reason, and Peter says ""hey, there's half of Lenny Kravitz"" lol"
61,"Can‚Äôt forget how he also thought he could get my Dad - a Catholic man who also married a Jewish woman - to help him talk us out of getting married using a ‚ÄúYou of all people know mixed marriages never work‚Äù.

Your Dad has the brain power of what comes out of our dog‚Äôs butt."
62,Yes my dad also said a lot of crazy things‚Ä¶still miss him‚Ä¶
63,If his kids are in public school I'll eat a hat.
64,Because then they can justify to themselves why other children dying is not so bad.
65,Not imaginary. Maybe Christian children have lots of holes that we don‚Äôt know about
66,It makes more sense when the framework is named: this is predestination-covenental BS.
67,It isn‚Äôt and it doesn‚Äôt
68,"How self righteous of you.

Let me guess, your next trick will be to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù the non-Hindus into a special zones or partitions for their safety. I think we have all seen this movie and the ending is a lesson in autocratic subhuman behavior."
69,Where racism
70,"I dont know, personally I think they're pretty *special*"
71,"Well, they're the ones with holes anyhow."
72,Yeah the fuck's probably probably holy in his eyes too‚Ä¶
73,"They're just going to make their children hate them, which is actually just fine with me. Religious indoctrination is child abuse."
74,"If they're Catholic, I'm sure those holes are well used by the priesthood."
75,ü§° understand the sarcasm will ya?? I was being sarcastic
76,Special in the way that they should have their own bus...
77,"/s please‚Ä¶

Unfortunately I have run into a Hindu or two that have extreme vitriol for non-Hindu people."
78,Don't judge a book by it's cover or be Prejudice man
79,"That book has no cover. It is laid bare for all to see, so stop projecting."
