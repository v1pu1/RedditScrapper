1,How does she know it wasn't the devil.
2,Weird. The exact same thing happened to me but god said to me that I should vaccinnate my kids so they don't die from easily preventable diseases.
3,Sounds like she's having hallucinations.  Psychotic. Sick in the head.
4,Delay? Not refuse!!!!  You doubt the word of disembodied voice in your head!!!!!  Feel my wrath!!!!
5,"That one time in the Bible when that guy was told to kill his kid but then got epically pranked. If god really said that, gods gonna prank tf out of her. LOL"
6,"Not delusional. Just making stuff up.

Most cults are full of this sort of straight lying. It keeps perpetuating this behavior."
7,"A simple question to this guy or gal.

Does your kid not have the polio vaccine? If they say no, show them pictures of children who didn‚Äôt get and question if they love their superstition more then their obviously real child.

If they say yes, ask them then what the fuck is their problem? 

Why do these people want their children to suffer? I dont fucking get it"
8,"Yeah extended exposure to carbon monoxide is trippy, make sure you have a detector in every floor of the house."
9,These people should not be allowed to breed.
10,"I always think about this when people say they prayed about something. Like, if you‚Äôre just meditating and thinking and you come to a conclusion in your internal monologue, fine. 

But if you actually hear a voice? That you identify as not being a product of your own thoughts? You‚Äôre mentally ill. You need help. You shouldn‚Äôt be in any kind of position of trust or authority."
11,"Literal GOD is speaking to you and you're like: ""Make my car go!"""

13,if i suddenly heard a voice telling me what to do i‚Äôd get tested for schizophrenia
14,"Okay, why the *fuck* would God say that? Did this person accidentally birth the Antichrist or the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or something that should not be allowed to live?! Because I can't think of any other good reason why God ‚Äî who's supposed to be much, *much* smarter than humans ‚Äî would tell someone not to vaccinate their child."
15,This is mental illness and honestly all of them christian nationals are mentally ill. To follow a book from 2000 years ago believing said book was written by god is not normal. Not ever seeing god or having god do anything while also letting millions suffer and still following his so called word is delusional. U can learn the history of humans who were alive and were they lived during the time the bible was written and u can see how the bible just reinforced what those uneducated people thought. This was a time of kings and queens and to control the masses what better then a book by the supposed creator to have them behave and do as you please. It made sense 2000 years ago but it makes absolutely no fucking sense to follow the bible and make laws on it today with the knowledge and education the majority of the citizens in this country have. Either our education system truly failed all those zealots or they have the education but for some fucking reason still choose to follow what a bunch of illiterate and uneducated persons wrote down. Fuck all them
16,"Instead of helping starving kids dying of cancer, God took performed a miracle for this lady to justify her beliefs. If that‚Äôs really God, is that a God you would want?"
17,Saw a video that talked about how often schizophrenia goes undiagnosed in the church community because the voices are passed as ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and thus you have Delusions of Grandeur
18,[deleted]
19,God sounds like a twat.
20,"Lies for Jesus!

They're all God's special children that HE HIMSELF has taken a personal interest in, and they're the protagonists of their own epic sagas, each and every one of them. They'll lie to everyone and lie to themselves until they forget what the truth actually is.

But it's okay! Because it's for Jesus!"
21,"Ex-Christian here. When I used to say I heard gods voice, what I actually heard was myself thinking. Then I'd reinforce that thought by thinking it must have been god. But it didn't actually sound any different than any other thought I would normally have."
22,Whether she is making it all up to score Christian brownie points or actually believes this happened she has mental issues.
23,"Exactly why I am no longer religious.  Spent a few years with a born again who prayed for every car ride, every piece of food.  I just wanted to say to her - you know kids are starving and dying right? Seems kinda selfish to hog the channel.  I am all for being grateful and giving thanks to the universe but so many people take it TOO FAR.  Pretty sure god would never hate scientists who have ended much of suffering children went through in the past. It used to be normal for parents to lose 2-3 of their children.  But you know, maybe let your child die.  See where you go after that. Probably not to the same place they go."
24,It‚Äôs rough seeing someone deal with schizophrenia üòî
25,Either that's a very intricate albeit stupid lie or they have a severe mental illness.
26,"If she genuinely heard an ‚Äúaudible voice‚Äù saying that, she needs psychiatric help. That is extremely concerning"
27,Mental health help IS available.
28,Yahweh demands child sacrifice via plague
29,Be glad god didn't tell him/her to skin the child alive...
30,It kind of makes you wonder if any of them believe the bullshit they spew.
31,Isn't this the plot of The binding of Isaac?
32,"Is it okay to command God to make the car go, or say you‚Äôll follow His command only if he does what you say?"
33,"Frankly, considering what a vaccination is, I would sooner guess that would be a demonic attack. Well, if I was in their position, that is."
34,Ey if one of these people ever hits me with their car because their brain started playing tricks on them Ill literally die.
35,"Clear signs of schizophrenic psychosis.  Or, they're just full of shit."
36,"GOD:  HEY IDIOT, TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL!!!!!"
37,this happened to me too! except it wasn't god and he just told me to get the fuck out of the middle of the road
38,This story makes sense. He was just protecting his loyal clergy. Many priests prefer to molest unvaxxed kids because they usually die before they can testify. True story.
39,Cool story to justify endangering your child
40,This is insanity. I feel for that child.
41,"What I really need to know is: did god start the car using the starter motor? Or did he use his power to move the pistons directly? **OR**, oh man, did he simply pause the atomic state mid-combustion and then unpause it?? But then, what about the momentum on the rest of the drivetrain? Maybe he levitated the car just a few millimeters and gradually removed its energy until it stopped, put it back down, then unpaused the engine.

I dunno, she may have made the whole thing up to boost her social piety score.

edit: I guess, being god, he could just remove all energy from the vehicle and bring it and all occupants safely to a stop instantaneously ... then just restore that state. Man, that sounds complicated, all for what? Doesn't that kind-of violate free will? Why wouldn't a voice-only warning suffice? Why use interference by divine intimidation at all? That doesn't seem very godly."
42,"Hearing voices, when no one is there, is a problem."
43,"This sounds like a narrative my aunt would spew. It makes me sad this is most of my extended family, as well as a now ex best friend. Covid/Trumpism shifted absolutely everything for me and opened my eyes to the divide I now have between myself and people like this"
44,"GOD, IS THAT YOU?!??! MAKE MY CAR GO!!"
45,"r/thatHappened

Yeah, you were driving somewhere and your car just suddenly died. And you didn't cause or be part of a major wreck, because that's a thing that happens."
46,I love how she told God to make her car go THIS INSTANT. God suddenly reveals himself and your first reaction isn't paralyzed awe but telling him to cut it out. Lmao this is amazing
47,When you forget to take your schizophrenia meds and hold up traffic for 5 minutes
48,I hope they're making it up cause otherwise that person has prob got some undiagnosed schizophrenia and that poor kid is in serious danger.
49,"Not long after I started dating my now wife, I met some of her extended family, one branch of which were Jehovah's Witnesses. I wasn't familiar with the denomination and asked for details. After my wife's aunt stop trying to suggest I come visit the hall and convert, I learned, among other things, that there are some members who claim to hear the voice of God and that they are among those pre-ordained to have a spot in heaven, and are seen as blessed and particularly righteous within the faith.

Later I asked my wife-to-be how one would tell if such a person was simply lying to receive such status, and she told me ""Well you're not allowed to question them on it unless they're really going against their rules, so it probably happens a lot."""
50,Why is it never ‚ÄúGive your boy the_sylince $500!‚Äù?
51,This isn't delusion. It's fan-fiction
52,On my way to the doctor I got stopped at every red light. That's it.
53,Whoooo doggie that‚Äôs some delusional sit! Edit shit
54,Did God mention student loans as well?
55,Surprised they could hear whatever was speaking to them over the sounds of people angrily honking at the person stopped in the middle of the road.
56,"""you have to start my car again this instant!!""

And god obeyed her

wow"
57,"Wow. Not only did God create the people who discovered vaccines  and the millions of scientists who proved it useful, but he can also directly apply the brakes to modern vehicles."
58,Plot twist: her anti-vax mom/dad/whatever Planted a speaker in her car and a remote cut off for the engine.
59,every child deserves a parent. not every parent deserves a child.
60,This ladies and gentlemen is what a schizo affective person looks like
61,"If God didn't want people to get vaccinated, why did he create our biology so that vaccines work?"
62,"When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation."
63,"Oh good, the EMP and the bluetooth antenna are both working as designed..."
64,"""my divine plan is to have your child die of preventable diseases for the lulz"" - God probably"
65,r/yeahthathappened
66,r/thathappened
67,Cause that totally happened. They need to learn to write more believable stories
68,Daddy issues.  Hallucinations.  Schizophrenic performance art.  Who knows?
69,"Straight up mental health if she truly believes it. But, chances are it's just her posting trash on social media for acceptance and feeling important. Either way, complete mental health issue."
70,"Why didn't her god intervene when she was putting on the seatbelt? If our bodies should have seat belts around them, then god would hsve created us an that manner?"
71,Why do these stories of God using their power for 'good' always just make them sound like a colossal arsehole?
72,Postpartum psychosis.
73,"And then their kid got a preventable illness and spread it to other kids and killed a few immunocompromised children. The law is to vaccinate because we value all children, not just the ones who have delusional parents with savior complexes. I hope to see a day where religious zealots cry out to the skies on corners and no one cares. Their mad howls for religion based reform a joke for all to laugh at. I hope that one day, the zealots cry for laws and reforms and are publicly rebuked in the press for forcing their beliefs on others. I want peaceful facts to slowly strangle religion until it's pacified and defeated... Until people keep their religions to themselves because they no longer wish for the world to analyze their beliefs...I wish that religion wasn't a shield for horrors beyond measure to be committed, but it is... So much like keeping tin and trash laying around in your yard for snakes, religions give snakes a place to hide too. I don't know exactly how to come up with an objective moral belief system but I'm pretty sure we can do it. The simplest truth remains the same though, ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's not religious, it's common sense. I think the truth is that the golden rule drives no one's decisions... That's why they love that Bible. Translate it right, muck about with the exact words used in translation, modernize the lingo or use old versions to be harder to understand etc... Then suddenly you can find a passage to cover anything you want to do. Child murder, rape, genocide, violence of all kinds, probably even torture. It's such a kind book to the one interpreting it..."
74,"Totally, 100% believable.  Yup.  No lies being given by this nut job, just 100% truths‚Ä¶ üôÑ"
75,She took her foot off the brake and the car started again.
76,"As a pagan who works with Yaweh, can confirm they believe in vaccinating your fricking crotch goblins."
77,"Took my car to the mechanic after it stopped dead in the middle of the road.

He said it's either my alternator or God, but he'd have to run a diagnostic and consult with a priest to give me a definite answer.

Either way, there's a $175 minimum service charge."
78,It would be delusional to believe these people are not delusional.
79,Postpartum psychosis is very real and there is help.
80,‚ÄúI will sacrifice my child on the altar of stupidity just as god demands!‚Äù
81,"This chick knowingly made up a scenario to explain why she can't vaccinate her kid, and she honestly expects people to believe it. These people are delusional, just in a more ""normal"" way."
82,She made it up.
83,There is a high probability this person needs electroshock therapy.
84,Yep sure that happened
85,r/thathappened
86,r/thathappened
87,Why is this written like a nosleep story lmaoüíÄ
88,"...when I got home my mom called and seemingly out of nowhere, said, ""Schizophrenia runs in our family ya know? Your peepaw and meemaw had it and everybody who's gone on before."""
89,Children raising children
90,Fking Christian fundies with delusional fantasy land beliefs.
91,Often do lunatics confuse the voices in their head as the voice of God.
92,Isaac's mom heard a voice from above...
93,"If you actually think you hear god speaking back to you, you shouldn't be able to make medical decisions for yourself let alone others."
94,/r/ThatHappened
95,What the actual f?
96,Sounds like a showing sign of some mental illness.
97,This is why you dont do drugs
98,Yep. This is what insanity looks like.
99,And then she built an anti-vax baseball field in the middle of an Iowa cornfield.
100,This is a bunch of whacko crazy nonsense
