1,I rather had that person around than the centuries of hate and genocides these nuts bring only for power and control. Thier religions claims to be so peaceful and loving but hates everyone to even themselves.
2,"I'm a sci-fi cyberpunk junkie; my first thought was ""weak implant setup, dude"". I need my phone feed overlaid on my regular vision and at least one fully robotic limb."
3,I just assumed that was a Republican politician having a good time outside the Republican national convention.
4,This pic made me uncomfortable... I mean high heels? Common! At that point in time I hope we evolve away from those useless and painful shoes XD
5,"“We must destroy our country with civil war before it is destroyed by high heels and lipstick.” 
-The Republicans"
6,"Every one of these morons thinks the government is going to order them to eat bugs and it's not going to be, you know, climate change damage causing beef to be $250/lb that does it.

If we are eating bugs in 20 years a big part of it is because your dumb ass is rolling coal right now."
7,"I mean, I probably wouldn’t opt for those implants myself, but no judgment here. What other people do with their own bodies is none of my business.  Don’t know why that is such a hard concept for people to grasp."
8,"Damn, Markeplier really let himself go"
9,"Cybernetic implants in just 7 more years? 

I'd be more worried about the cooperate surveillance around monitoring my nutrient blood data so Amazon can send me ads for restaurants that sell the food with vitamins I'm lacking.
Yeah, more worried about that than those ugly ass high heels... Why's it always pink hair?"
10,"People start to see the world changing because of global warming, late stage capitalism and general unrest. Ignorance and fear makes them want to blame somebody, and who to better blame than the people you hate?"
11,"I’d rather be this guy than being someone who is racist, transphobic, misogynistic, hateful, supremacist, extreme religious in the extreme way"
12,"Wait, is that the SDG logo on the top right?
Wtf? Whats their beef with SDG?"
13,"There are dozens of variations of this meme in right wing media. This one, however, it the ugliest, most amateurish shit I’ve ever seen. To call the creator a bad artist is an insult to artists everywhere."
14,"Lol. Sitting outside in a desert wasteland because the capitalists destroyed the environment and the economy.

Checks out.

I wouldn't mind a little tech on my wrist, but no one is going to give up big screens. It's over. We lost.

I have the smallest phone I can find, because I have tiny, useless hands. All screens are huge, we'll never escape them.

When a new vaccine is created, wouldn't you have to go get your vaxx pack updated? Wouldn't you just get the shot at that point?

More realistically, it would be an air purifier/oxygen tank, but that's too difficult a reality to accept.

Also, does this mean I can go tits-out? Because I abandoned bras with covid, and frankly, tits-out would be ideal. Especially if the temperatures keep rising and we have to live outdoors. My flappies get hot and need the ventilation.

So, my interpretation: the scumbag capitalists scumbag the planet into a wasteland, where you live outdoors and communicate by antenna instead of satellite. (Or, they could be camping, where they have a functional, high tech home to return to once they finish their vacation. Implying people actually get to take fucking vacations in the future.)

You don't have to carry ID or credit cards or anything, because you have a handy little QR code.

You're artificially healthy through the wonders of modern medicine.

You are not constrained by pointless social norms, and can dress and decorate yourself however you desire.

You can go tits-out.

What's wrong with this again? I think I'm missing something here."
15,Brought to you by people who believe in fairy tales.
16,Dude the reach of the artist went so far he can pull his own tongue out of his asshole
17,"Is that the sun? Alright peeps roll up your sleeves, we’re gonna need to expedite this process."
18,He looks like a nice chap
19,Where does the vax tube go?  I've been taking them in the arm all this time.  Apparently I've been doing it wrong
20,"If The Lion King taught me one thing, it’s that meal is a lot better than it looks."
21,"Damn. If the mealworms are gonna be that big, we won't need to worry about food. My leopard gecko loves them and I trust her sense of taste."
22,"As a religious Muslim, I got to say that I hate when people try to force Islam/Christianity on others. My faith is very beautiful to me but it is extremely personal, who am I to force my faith in another person?"
23,Super Hans
24,Does that include climate change or no?
25,"And that is, somehow less acceptable than Hell.
I mean, like Hell, it's not even true. I guess I shouldn't be surprised this makes sense in their heads."
26,Lol boomer say phone bad and everyone claps
27,"You know that third thumb concept that made headlines about a year ago?

This guy would be so triggered by that, I'm sure."
28,I already shave my head so where do I go for my antenna?
29,can't we just be ignorant goat farmers again?
30,Those are some big grubs. I'd be pretty stoked to find grubs that size.
31,I love the Vax Pack
32,How are they sooooooooooooooo upset with a trans man having a child.
33,"In the republican future, outcasts from the domed shelters of the rich use crude cybernetics to survive. This is a luxury meal for 99% of humanity."
34,Those shoes look big enough for me. I am fine with this future because I'm not a dainty footed lady and I want cute shoes too.
35,Why tf is the symbol for the UN’s 17 Sustainability Goals in the top right?
36,What's wrong with being a gay cyberpunk?
37,"When taken literally there's hardly anything peaceful or loving about them. What people think are extremist when they see fundies a lot of times they're doing exactly what their books tell them to do. 

https://historicalbaggage.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-irony-of-peace-from-3-abrahamic.html?m=1

Granted I'm thankful there are many (mostly) good and peaceful people within these religions who are happy to question things and reinterpret them to better function in society and make it more about personal meaning over politics and forcing it upon others. But its also because those who are more peaceful aren't the ones in a theocracy of their religion either."
38,"Yeah, we’re going to shave our head to be able to stick on a neural link antenna?  

What’s the QR code on the mid chest?  I’ve got to look at a standard size phone screen under my right arm?

And a whole backpack for vaccine inoculation?

It would be evil if we ended up with this. Some of the sloppiest tech possible. Unless those high heels are actually jet boots and some advanced razor sharp fingernails, this just isn’t an acceptable dystopian future."
39,"That Black Mirror episode where people could take pictures with their eyeballs, man. That would be *amazing*."
40,"Republican: *gets caught* 
Republican: oh no! It’s that gosh darn agenda"
41,"Painful? Yes, I'll give you that. But (not speaking for anyone but myself) the pain is worth it for how amazing my ass looks."
42,we better not ! 👀
43,"If civil war comes, this time, the Republicans need to be utterly crushed."
44,They really do forget we queers also have guns in our high heels .
45,If you don’t have a QR code in your chest then how are we supposed to know who you are?
46,Was gonna say lol
47,"I think you’ll have to go tits out if you want to use your QR code, which apparently would only be able to be placed mid chest. 

Just gets a little funny when someone needs to scan it with their, what appears to be full phone, implant below their wrist. 

It’s have to be like a hug from behind?  Or sticking your arm up in a defensive pose like a shove?  

Maybe the eyes actually have a cybernetic implant, in which case I’ll have to say “I swear I’m trying to scan your QR code, it’s just not picking it up right”"
48,"Yeah. In the evil future, the sunlight contains the whole spectrum of known colors."
49,"*I already shave*

*My head so where do I go*

*For my antenna?*

51,"I’d be right there with you, but my dad is a Republican. I wish there was a way to make him see awful it is, but he’s been brainwashed by Fox News."
52,It’s going to be weird having to hold my inner right arm to your chest to figure stuff out.
53,The bar code on your forearm obviously.
54,"Yeah, I didn't even think of the logistics of scanning it.

It would have to be some kind of bear hug maneuver.

I was just imagining being at the grocery store, and the clerk scanning me with one of the hand-held scanners.

What if you're super hairy? Or have tig-ole-bitties? You'll have to hold them back so someone can scan your code.

They should put it on your forehead. Go full ""mark of the beast"" on this."
55,You can always scalp him so you have a piece of him afterwards.
56,">I'm sorry ma'am, your Circle Rewards card didn't show up when I scanned your universal identification code. Can you give me your social currency number?

>Sigh. It's 557 2486

>I'm sorry ma'am, that didn't work either. Are any of the numbers supposed to be capitalized?"
57,"“You’ve successfully scanned in your currency ID, but Circle Rewards members must use two factor authentication to prevent unauthorized use of their Circle Rewards Premium Benefits. 

In just a few moments, you’ll receive a BrainWave communication. Your AssBuzzer will vibrate a sequence in Morse Code that you’ll then enter into this keypad to continue. 

Thank you for being a valued Circle Rewards member and we look forward to serving you. This session will expire in 45 seconds.”"
58,"""I'm sorry. I was trying to pay attention, but I farted, and now I've lost all my progress."""
