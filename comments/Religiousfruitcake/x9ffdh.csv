1,“And that’s why Daddy is living with his ‘friend’ Steve now…”
2,The gay system must be strongest after the rain.
3,It's not wrong.  The dad is blocking his children from exposure to colors and smothering them in darkness.
4,"You have it wrong, he's a single gay father and he's using his gay bat signal to find a partner."
5,That’s ok… we took their rainbow… and we’re never giving it back! Mwahahahahaha!
6,"Luckily, the gay system rainbow only attacks from one precise angle."
7,"Not having a shield, I just threw myself between my children and the rainbow. Now I have skittles pox, I'm fucking delicious, no one should be this delicious."
8,Will he become captain planet if he absorbs enough gsy energy?
9,What does he do with the gay energy and where does he redirect it ?
10,"Because the only people whose kids turn out gay are democrats, I guess"
11,"Oh no, the Asgardians are attacking!"
12,Depictions of people safeguarding children against the menacing rainbow will never not be a hilarious image
13,Plot twist: The shield is the emitter
14,Naah. He's emitting the gay energy.
15,Looks like he’s shooting the rainbow out of the shield
16,I like his care bears shield
17,"Whenever I see this pic, I am reminded of this stupid cartoon series that my sister watched as a kid. Living teddy bears with symbols on their bellies lived in a cloud-land, and they were able to shoot - hm, for lack of a better word, ""good energy"" out of those symbols when they wanted to help someone. Which looked a bit like this! Which, at first glance, somehow leads to the association that this guy shoots the good rainbow energy out to someone in need of help. Quite contrary to what it is supposed to depict. :/"
18,I kind of thought he is trying to hold the fantastic world away and the roleplay system will teach them anyway. I am too involved in my hobby.
19,Clearly he is projecting out that rainbow and I would like to know if the projector is available on Amazon.
20,How else are you going to raise the King of Pop on the left?
21,Dad = gay
22,"Looks like he is rejecting Gods promise. 
Hmmm   Different strokes"
23,The father looks like a dude that crawled through the window with no pants to be with his special friends. Creepy AF.
24,"Why is he reading to the children in one very thin, very long bed

Whose bed is this

What is HAPPENING outside of the gay superpower absorption, that much is obvious"
25,Absorbing the gayness.
26,"“When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”  

Genesis 9:16"
27,this just in: gay people don't exist as they were all brainwashed by a young age to be straight
28,The message isn’t wrong if you don’t parent your kids cps will do it for you
29,Dipshits have way too much faith in the system if they think it'll do anything for their kids other than try to kill them if they don't provide it with their labor.
30,I guess I makes sense that the coneheads are homophobic????
31,r/unexpectedyoda
32,Daddy suddenly starts liking a quiznos mens room stall
33,I'm feeling the only thing missing here is a swastika on the book
34,What the hell is that between their heads?
35,Does that mean the dad goes visiting glory holes on the dl?
36,putting gay out into the world
37,You better shield them from the gay.
38,Jesus had two dads and he turned out okay.
39,"Double the dad, twice the dad jokes"
40,More like why daddy will be living in a cardboard box under a bridge at 80 when his children he disowned won't pay for his nursing home.
41,Wait until they find out about prisms.
42,"There have been a lot of double rainbows lately. Why isn't that a ""sign of God"" to let the people be gae in peace"
43,"Just close your eyes at school kids, don't want you getting illuminated in any way."
44,"That angle is 42 degrees ([https://inlightofnature.com/how-rainbows-form/](https://inlightofnature.com/how-rainbows-form/)) or as I call it ""the Gayngle"""
45,"That's the neat part, he doesn't redirect it..."
46,Gay children of Republicans tend to have short and miserable lives.
47,I think you are talking about care bears
48,So why would he protect his kid from God's promise?
49,"Guys, every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth _includes_ rainbow people"
50,"I was recruited, myself. They had a little booth and pamphlets and everything."
51,Most valid argument against gay marriage
52,"Prisms? What blasphemy.

/s"
53,That would mean God didn't condone their hate so they can't accept that.. the second coming could happen and they would persecute their savior because it wasn't their imagined reality. It won't happen but you know in that alternative reality where religion isn't fiction?
54,I like the angle of the Gayngle.
55,Ewwwwwww
56,"I checked back with wikipedia, and yepp, they look like what I remember."
57,Exactly!
58,"Wait… No, not like that!"
59,Sounds more like an argument FOR gay marriage.
60,I'm not quite sure I'm understanding what you're saying…
61,I prefer the dangle
62,Ah. I saw all the downvotes and was curious if I was missing some context.
63,Was that a dad joke?
64,I am saying that they're not believers of the Bible but the voice in their head that they label God. They reject anything that's not confirmation of that. This includes cherry picking Bible passages. This is why we see so many religious efforts to not feed the poor despite that being an edict from Christ in the Bible.
65,"Yeah, you’re not the only one.  I don’t think my intent was clear enough."
