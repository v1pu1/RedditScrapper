1,"Wait...so if I, a cis het woman, masturbate and take care of my own sexual needs then I don't have to clean up after myself? Then whose going to clean up the mess I make so I don't have to live in my own filth?"
2,"Imagine thinking that the reason why a woman isn‚Äôt into her man is because watches soap operas.

I mean I believe it. Those men on TV take care of themselves and are handsome. Imagine watching handsome men on TV all day only to have to see your out of shape husband later.

I feel for the woman."
3,"Shit, I had a couple of friends who were married and the wife was horny as hell. All the time, she wanted sex and the husband did housework as an excuse to not fuck.

He'd invite me over all the time to distract her with pot and video games so he could get some sleep too. If not for doing housework and my being there he would have never been able to do anything but work and fuck."

5,What do they mean by heaven? I thought that's where you go after you die?

7,He literally can't bring himself to consider that women like a wank.
8,"Well, well, well, how the turn tables."
9,I had an ex that was insatiable like that. It was great until she decided that sex outside of marriage was too sinful. I took that as an ultimatum to force me into wedlock and noped the fuck out.
