1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Good thing they said they weren't racist. Could have fooled me there.
2,Do we know this family is actually First Nation? We all know there’s at least a decent chance they’re from India and the fruitcake got confused…
3,"*I am not racist*

Uh-huh. Whatever you say Karen."
4,"So is the problem the neighbour not being white or the neighbor's daughter dressing ""inappropriately""?

But of course they're aren't being racist so it must be the second one, right? /s"
5,"I seriously hope that the kind author of that letter ""kindly"" catches covid. With ""all due respect ""."
6,"I remembee this one. OP was an Indian, as in, *from India*. Not Native Murican."
7,"I you have to open up with 'I am not racist, but..'  -- you are a racist.

This neighbour is toxic af and I'd take that letter to the police. They can't do much with it, but having a complaint on file could be important a little ways down the road, especially with that veiled threat at the very end."
8,Can the person who got this letter please sue? Do not ignore this. Sue sue SUE. Make this go viral. Make it hit national news.
9,"I find these attitudes to be ironically amusing, considering that the holders of these attitudes actually believe that are Christian, even though they are exhibiting the very behaviors Christ spoke against.  Jesus freely associated with sinners, tax collectors, Samaritans, Romans, Gentiles, and all manner of non-Jewish people that the ‘good’ Jews (ie, Sadducees and Pharisees) would not associate with, and called them brothers and sisters.  If one is to believe in a religion one should follow the precepts and tenets of that religion, to do otherwise is by definition sacrilegious.

Edit, ‘that they are Christian’,  my brain hiccuped."

11,Welp better tell my sister to cancel her engagement with her fiance since interracial marriage is a sin! /S
12,"When you have to state you are not Racist, you are a Racist"
13,"r/thathappened

It’s not the first photo in the *same format* that’s had different rage-bait text."
14,Police time. Harassment and vague threats. Possible hate crime as well.
15,“Your people” as if they’re some kind of extraterrestrial specie💀
16,Buy a gun.
17,It’s the “I’m not racist… but” statement that informed me I was in for a wild ride of a read
18,"I’m not racist, but"
19,What a deranged lunatic.
20,All of this is fucking disgusting
21,"""I'm not racist but...""

**Proceeds to bigotry**"
22,"""I'm not racist, but my God is"""
23,"Many racists rationalize like ""well racism is an unfair bias, and the stuff I think about other races is true and so isn't unfair. They really are lazy, dirty, stupid, and ruining the world for us."""
24,"I'm pretty sure I saw this posted a long time back and the OP was actually Asian Indian, and not u.s. indigenous peoples."
25,">for the well-being of you and your family

Tha borderline threatening at the end too."
26,Kinda sounds like the real problem is author's son got a crush on neighbor's daughter.
27,"I assumed that immediately and was confused about where there would be an Indian reservation. *Ohhh*, you mean indigenous."
28,"It's a good trick to get the barman to pay attention to you. ""I'm not racist but id like to have a beer please"""
29,"I have never heard the word sadducees, what is that?"
30,Oof
31,It was also posted yesterday and everyone said it's been posted before and is fake.
32,"The Sadducees were a socio-religious sect of Jews during Jesus’ time that did not believe in resurrection of the dead, spirits, or oral law traditions, but only in adherence to the written Law.  The Pharisees, in contrast, did believe in resurrection and spirits.  Both sects were Conservative, focusing on the letter of the Law rather than the spirit of the Law.  A modern example would be tricking or convincing someone to sign all their money over to you.  Legally (the letter of the Law) you did nor steal their money, but since you tricked them into it on a moral level you did steal their money (the spirit of the Law).  Wrong actions are not always illegal, and legal actions aren’t always right."
33,"This post pops up fairly often, I just don't remember what the actual story was or if it was fake. It seems a little suspicious to me though"
34,The grammar and spelling is much better than your average racist crap.
35,Very interesting! Thank you.
