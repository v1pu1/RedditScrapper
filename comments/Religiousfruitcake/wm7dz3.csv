1,"""Being a worker in our capitalist society makes you not free, but having no agency does somehow?"""
2,"“Especially in this sexually frustrated society of ours”. 

I wonder why they’re so frustrated. The answer eludes me."
3,Tell that to the women beaten to a pulp by their husbands.
4,"Maybe these religious nuts think that everyone must be ""sexually frustrated"", but it's just them."
5,"The first question is how much serving makes her husband respect her? So much, that it's a full time job and she doesn't have time to work?
Really, did she marry a toddler?

Secondly, isn't she serving her husband by helping him to improve the families income by 30 $ an hour, to take some pressure off his shoulders? 
Or does the husband want that weight alone,  to constantly remind her of it : That he has so much stress at work, so she should be quite and make his life pleasurable, because of this. Otherwise he could stop feeding her and her kids? Is that respect or blackmail?

And who's fault is it, that it's only some 30$ an hour?
Maybe womens' wages are made by male Christian bosses to keep her at home, to serve her husband? 

This statement is so weird, and raises a lot of questions..."
6,"If I could win 30€ per hour, my husband would stay at home and he would so happy for both of us!"
7,"“£30 an hour” where? Please direct me to the person paying £30 an hour, I would like £30 an hour"
8,"If she gets paid to do a job, she can leave that job and has money to life off of.

If she only works at home for a husband, she can't leave because she has nothing of her own.

Maybe women should be allowed to make that choice themselves."
9,Or the other option and hear me out on this. A woman working to support herself is a good thing and your frustated that the way you view  women isn't shared by  everyone else. Cause not everyone was raised with the idea that people should be forced or put into stereotypical roles.
10,£30 an hour? WHERE? GIMME
11,"Than just switch and let the men be ""opressed"" for a few month. I bet male muslims would go beserk."
12,"This screwball doesn't fuck (wonder why...?), so he thinks you shouldn't either."
13,"Ah yes a real women is what I dream about, hah nah I pulled a bird that worked in my hotel a while back and nailed her harder against that sink then the Romans did on the cross. Well let me say I had a real women's thighs cutting of my legs ability to circulate. But alas it is this day and age that you can find a real women.... One to tear and rip your skin too. So to whoever wants a women waiting for you when you get back, it's best to wait and see when a nymphomaniac waltz in."
14,"well, he's probably the one that's sexually frustrated. I... can't imagine why."
15,bad grammar.
16,Once he loses his virginity he will mellow out
