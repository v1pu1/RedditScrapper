1,Tell her ur closer to heaven than her and u cant see anyone up there. Cant even hear footsteps
2,"If blessings mean you have to believe in God, can I use my height (4'11"") and the existence of periods as an excuse for my atheism?"
3,"Dang, you're tall."
4,Does she think heaven is at 7 feet?  7’7?
5,"You have 6'8"" genitals?

That's not a gift from God, that's a curse!"
6,"It's easier for a 6'8"" person to fit through the eye of a needle than a camel or something."
7,What a ludicrous argument. Is she implying that taller people have a lower aptitude for reason and critical inquiry than shorter people?
8,"Is it easier for a 6'8"" person to believe in god than for a 6'2"" person that is aware of the existence of 6'8"" people?"
9,Op is nephilem

16,"The entire human female reproductive system is evdience it is either a result of the process of natural evolution, or a god who was the defintion of incompetence and had no idea what the fuck he was doing. 

I really dont understand how any woman can experience periods, childbirth, menopause etc and all the pain and nonsensical shit that goes with it all and think ""Ah yes. An all powerful, all knowing, all loving god designed this hot mess"". 

Anyhoo...need to get some rest cause in the morning I'm having a new IUD implant to prevent my constantly miscarrying uterus from making me bleed to death."
17,I wrap it around my waist a few times so I can walk without tripping over it.
18,"Well, if you melt it, you can pour it through the eye I'm sure."
19,"It’s so bad, I’ve had chronic back pain since I was 13-14"
20,Why would any sane god put the amusement park right next to the waste disposal facility?
21,Their answer is that Eve eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is the reason for agonizing childbirth. Menstrual suffering must also be part of that Divine Punishment.
22,"Or, in the case of men, the amusement park and the waste disposal are one and the same."
23,Except the bible only had childbirth in pain as punishment. It never mentioned the menstruation and especially not the menopause and spontaneous abortion stuff. Then again they had very little idea of how the female reproductive system worked which explains why they stoned women and girls to death for not bleeding the first time they have sex even though most women don't bleed the first time.
