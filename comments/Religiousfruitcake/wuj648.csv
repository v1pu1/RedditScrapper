1,"And then I've heard some muslims say that ""Islam doesn't allow forced conversion"" like wtf

Your ancestors converted whole fucking countries after conquering them or they were converted themselves after being conquered."

3,"Not just not allowing it, Islam literally says that no conversion at sword point should ever be trusted. It also allows to lie about it.

I guess the said husbands need to have their throats slit in their sleep more."

5,"I may be wrong here, but I feel like Islam in some places and at some times runs into the same problem that Christianity does. That is, the message becomes unimportant, and the messenger is the thing that gets worshipped. Of course, ignoring the actual message also allows people who just want power to get it, so they do, and use it to impose whatever ""religious"" rule they come up with to advance their own interests."
