2,"I was about twelve when I remember my priest said “God doesn’t like lukewarm. He doesn’t want you half praising him from the fence.”

3,"So OOP's religion is flooring it without brakes?

Jesus takes the wheel?"
4,"I don't know what there is to not understand it's a perfect analogy. You see atheist only go forward at break neck speed plowing threw pedestrians with violent anti-morality, and theists never go anywhere because their foot is firmly planted on the breaks of they're broken down '87 Chevy pickup they leave on cinder blocks out in the junkyard. Of course finally we have the agnostics who are just terrible drivers and should never be allowed inside a vehicle. ( /s fucking obviously)"
5,Checking for bad engine mounts?
6,Walter Jr
7,Agnostic. The lazy man's atheist.
