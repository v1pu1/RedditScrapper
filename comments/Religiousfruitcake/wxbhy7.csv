1,Cool fan fiction I will say.
2,I think he's talking about his new idea for a fantasy novel series.
3,Funny. I seem to recall the Bible saying God mandated circumcision for the children of Abraham.

5,Judaism doesn’t believe in the devil lol
6,"I mean, do you expect anything less from iFunny. 90% of the app's userbase are religious zealots."
7,At least he opposes holy war...
8,"If you're going to criticize the bible, at least do it honestly. This argument will make you look stupid infront of an intellectual Christian. That is the old testament, the old testament is not what the Christians worship. They worship the gospel, the new testament. Which liberated people from old testament law and brought a new law. In the books of Paul, part of the gospel, Paul says that those who are circumcised will not be favoured by God. Other parts of the bible condemn bodily mutilation. Circumcision is a form of male genitalia mutilation. Conclusion? The bible bans circumcision."
9,"How am I criticizing the Bible here? I’m criticizing the argument. Not the Bible this time.

So? The Old Testament is still part of scripture, isn’t it? And funny. I seem to recall Jesus saying that the law will not be void till heaven and earth pass away and all is accomplished. (Matthew 5:17-18) In fact, to my knowledge, there is nothing man can do to terminate the OT laws. Nor is there such a clause within said laws.

Oh really? And where does Paul say that those who are circumcised will not be favored by God? Heck. If my memory serves me correctly, Jesus himself got circumcised when he was young."
10,">The Old Testament is still part of scripture, isn’t it?

You're not smart, my guy, you are not smart at all. There is a reason why atheists don't target the old testament that much for a reason... You should try to understand why. And you should learn to listen, cause you're embarrassing yourself by yapping your mouth too much.

>I seem to recall Jesus saying that the law will not be void till heaven and earth pass away and all is accomplished. (Matthew 5:17-18)

You haven't read the Bible, have you? You watched some YouTube videos of your favorite echo chamber men and decided you were ready to debate the bible? Jesus says that the law itself is not cast aside. But Jesus also changes the law in a lot of fundamental ways!

>Oh really? And where does Paul say that those who are circumcised will not be favored by God?

This is why you should 1. Learn the fucking bible before debating it. 2 learn more about the bible itself cause you're embarrassing yourself.

First of all... You seem to think that the gospels were written by the apostles. Or maybe you are aware that they're not bur you phrased that question poorly. Anyhow  This is not the case, they were named after them. Not written by them. If you don't understand the significance of this mistake, you probably don't understand the bible enough to talk about it.

Second of all, it's literally a single Google search. Could you not even be bothered to double check if you might be wrong before embarrassing yourself? Y'know what that's called? Hard headed and stubborn. 


Galatians 5:2-11:

""I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.""

1 Corinthians 7:18

""Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.""

And this one is the most important one in the matter. ""was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.""

It is true the undoing of circumcision is banned. But further circumcisions than have already been made were also banned.

Now, I know that you want to answer to all of this. I know you think you just HAVE to validate your intelligence by winning in a reddit debate. But you are simply wrong. No one will blame you for shutting up and moving on. *You are simply wrong, don't do any mental gymnastics in order to continue debating.* I know you want to, but just don't. Don't embarrass yourself further. No one will hold it against you. Knowing when you're wrong is also an important aspect to intelligence."
11,"You never answered my first question. You completely ignored it. The Old Testament is still a part of scripture, isn’t it?

Why yes. I did read the Bible. And frankly, that’s what it said it Matthew 5:17-18. Do I need to quote it for you?

>“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5:17-18‬ ‭KJV‬‬

He even goes on to say that whoever breaks one of the commandments in the law and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great. (Matthew 5:19)

And looking at the passages you cite, I don’t see anything that says that God will not favor those who are circumcised. Nor anything about outright banning circumcision entirely. This argument seems to be completely made up and unbiblical.

If I am wrong, actually prove it. Don’t just insult me or say that I am wrong. Prove it."
12,">You never answered my first question. You completely ignored it. The Old Testament is still a part of scripture, isn’t it?

Heh, you're not bright. I'm sorry to see that you're this narrow minded and require your intelligence to be validated so much that you have to pull off mental gymnastics to keep arguing. You're wrong. And I don't think you're intellectually honest enough to be convinced of that, so I'll keep it with this:

Learn about the things you wish to debate about, because as long as you do not, you'll embarrass yourself like you did today."
13,"I’m still not hearing an answer, am I? And what did I do to deserve these insults? Question a claim that I see no reason to believe is “biblical”?

I pull no mental gymnastics nor insults at any point. Only pulling out scripture and reading your citations. And yet, I am treated like a fool because I don’t subscribe to your beliefs. Rather sad, isn’t it?"
14,"I'm not arguing someone who's a close minded idiot, get over yourself. LOL"
15,"And are you trying to suggest you are “open-minded”? Yet, you didn’t count what I said because it challenged what appears to be a made up narrative. I fail to see what I did wrong here. I cited relevant scripture and pulled no apologetics nor insults to your intelligence or character. Is not falling for what I am seeing as “unbiblical nonsense” making me the bad guy here?"
16,"My guy, stop trying to validate your intelligence on Reddit, you've embarrassed yourself twice already and now you're clearly frustrated that I won't give you the debate you aimlessly seek after for mental validation."
17,How am I trying to look for validation? I seek answers and proof for your claims. I would do the same to you. Why do you refuse to do the same to me?
18,"I gave you the answers dawg. You're just mentally incapable of accepting an opposing view point. You said you didn't see anything that banned circumcision despite the words ""those who have not been circumcised should not seek circumcision"" literally being in there. You are mentally incapable if you cannot see what that means. And to answer your tHe oLd tEsTaMeNt iS pArT oF tHe sCriPtuRe argument.


Hebrews 8:13
""In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.""

I'll make it clear, I dislike people who are intellectually dishonest. That is what you are. That is why I don't want to debate with you. You don't disagree with me because you have a good argument and a good reason. You disagree with me because you do not *want* to agree with me."
