8,"Unless the Quran is a manga, they photoshopped the moon on the wrong side, lol"
9,"I never fail to get a kick out of people talking about other religions. I love hearing about how their nonsense is the right nonsense. The other guys they believe some crazy stuff, not like my crazy stuff. It's especially good when they are just offshoots of the the same religion."
10,"Be seeing you guys there soon. While it's lacking in sense obviously, that time comes."
11,New testament and the quran are eps 2 and 3 of the yahweh trilogy
12,"Yeah, basically.

The bible is essentially the Torah with the New Testament slapped on.

The Qu'ran is basically the bible with Mohammad's teachings added.

As a result, Muslims believe that Jesus was a very important prophet, just not the messiah. There's not very much daylight between the abrahamic religions."
