1,"So I should trust in an ""all powerful"" god that refuses to help when people need it the most? Ok. That sounds like a good idea. /S"
2,"""You had to know what one felt like"" 

- some guy on the internet who probably never had a bigger problem than their electricity bill being somewhat high or their kids watching netflix all day."
3,"‚ÄúIt's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?‚Äù - Stephen Fry"
4,We can‚Äôt even fathom the despair those poor souls went through in the concentration camps. They‚Äôve seen and felt the darkest side of humanity. God wasn‚Äôt there for them. A God that doesn‚Äôt help those people isn‚Äôt a God anyone should praise or worship.
5,Jay Crownover needs terrible things to happen to him.
6,So basically if a miracle occurs it‚Äôs ‚ÄòTHANK THE LORD FOR THIS BLESSING!‚Äô But when something horrible happens it‚Äôs all ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not the Lords fault!‚Äô.
7,">So the LORD said to him, ‚ÄúWho has made man‚Äôs mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the LORD?

Exodus 4:11

You don't just get to give God credit when cool shit happens to people.  He takes credit for the bad, too."
8,"I think killing 6 million people to make a point was a bit excessive, even for a deity."
9,"This isn't the kind of thing where you say ""life has to be bitter to be sweet"" like when someone's business has a downturn or they lose the big game."
10,"On the whole ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have one without the other‚Äù, that‚Äôs just a false dichotomy. It isn‚Äôt one or the other because they‚Äôre ignoring that aside from good and evil there is also neutral."
11,"Of all the conceited beliefs humans hold, those beliefs in a faith are the most childish."
12,"Jay, who spells his last name with a comma, can dip a pipe in epoxy, roll it in crushed glass, and shove it up his ass."
13,Yeah cuz god is there every moment of your life but once something bad happens to you he is out of office. Makes total sense. /S
14,"Reading about a comfort woman‚Äôs book (sex slaves of the Imperial Japanese Army in WW2) made me question god even more. A Filipino teenager kidnapped and kept as a sex slave by the Japanese for years, then her life went downhill even after that. Her first husband left her after a sister told him about her past as a comfort woman. Becoming a single mother to 4 children, living in poverty, making a living as a garbage lady until she got cancer. Like how could a ‚Äúgood‚Äù god let women like her live such unfortunate lives?"
15,‚ÄúGott mit uns‚Äù ‚Ä¶
16,"There was a nurse working in the trauma ward of a hospital in war-torn Syria treating children with horrific wounds meant for a battlefield as their distraught parents looked on helplessly. She said something so matter-of-fact and obvious to anyone experiencing such horror - ""there's no yahweh here."""
17,"This is similar to why I am an atheist. I have been through hell and back. My parents who are the source of shit like multiple 3rd degree sunburns? They said it was God's will. So they're not guilty. He is. But he also didn't make me deserve it. Basically this makes me wary as fuck because it ignores pain and free will. 

Before anyone asks I am now safe but my health is hot garbage. Essentially the people who say this are capable of the atrocities that cause people to feel this way"
18,"""Through me the Evangelical Protestant Church could become the established church, as in England"" - Adolf Hitler"
19,"They saw some of the worst humanity has to offer, and said it was part of god‚Äôs plan. One shudders to imagine the suffering they would cause just so they could go to heaven."
20,">‚ÄúI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Isaiah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠45:7‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

I‚Äôm surprised no one has put this passage here yet.

Also, is god truly all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving? If so, would it not be possible for him to create a world where we don‚Äôt need bad to experience good, where we don‚Äôt need sorrow to experience joy, where we don‚Äôt need war to experience peace? Frankly, I‚Äôd find such a proposal ludicrous if we had to experience those things under such a god‚Äôs watch while he could fix them."
21,Gods not real. I wish we could stop engaging at all with Religious people
22,"Jay is correct. I cannot enjoy a sunny day on the beach without the comforting knowledge that someone, somewhere is being tortured ü§Æ"
23,"oh yeah, that helps."
24,I think Jay needs a stay at one
25,Fuck the Lord
26,"The reason I am an atheist. If any religion can logically explain the Holocaust to me and why an ethical, moral, all loving God did nothing to stop it, I would gladly convert."
27,"The answer was on a question titled

[What will you say if you met the man who wrote: ""If there is a god, he will have to beg my forgiveness.""?](https://www.quora.com/What-will-you-say-if-you-met-the-man-who-wrote-If-there-is-a-god-he-will-have-to-beg-my-forgiveness)  


at least *most* of the other answers were good"
28,"So he didn't put the Jews in concentration camps, but he put rape babies in 10 year olds?"
29,This is a mental disorder.
30,Holocaust and other genocides in history is the major reason I don't believe in any god.
31,"I sleep well and soundly, just like god during the Holocaust."
32,Quora is full of the most self confident morons I‚Äôve ever seen. I try to filter quora out of any search I do on anything.
33,"""God has total control over every atom in the universe!""

""Then why did he let the Nazis exterminate Jews?""

""Oh, well that was them, that wasn't God.""

I mean, how does this person even put on socks without tripping over contradictions in their view of reality?"
34,Sounds like someone who didn't die in a concentration camp
35,"I'm sorry isn't your sky daddy all knowing? and all powerful? and works in mysterious ways? And yada yada.

""God"" created the Nazi's and did nothing while they committed some of the most awful acts in the history of humanity. 

So yes ""god"" did put him in that concentration camp....if he actually existed.

Religious people are insane, sadistic and cruel. Not even once will I subject myself to that mind poison."
36,"They always like to claim their god is all powerful and full of love, but not powerful or loving enough to stop atrocities against the innocent because of free will or something."
37,"That whole idea that underpins the Christian justification for mass suffering‚Äîthat we can‚Äôt have joy without suffering‚Äîwould, by their logic that God is omnipotent, only be true if God wanted us to have to suffer. An omnipotent deity could‚Äôve chosen to design our brains in a way that makes us sufficiently appreciate good things happening without ever having to experience anything bad to compare them to, and in a way where we never get bored of or complacent in bliss. Suffering exists because God wanted it to."
38,"Seen it a million times.

""The lord is all powerful and all knowing. Nothing happens without his will.""

""Even this horrible thing?""

""OBVIOUSLY NOT! SOMEONE ELSE DID THAT! HOW DARE YOU?!"""
39,Imagine correcting a Holocaust victim‚Äôs take on the existence of God.
40,"I got in an argument with my Aunt about this. We were debating some topic, and she tried to throw scripture at me. I told her that the Bible didn‚Äôt really hold any meaning to me because 1. I don‚Äôt believe it in the first place and 2. It has been changed throughout the years by the church. I pointed out historical inaccuracies, translation errors, and the point that the Catholic Church is one of the most corrupt institutions in human history. 

She essentially feel back to ‚Äúif God cannot protect the sanctity of his word than he is not God at all‚Äù. I told her that I came to a similar conclusion. Which made her more angry. 

The conversation went down hill from there but it ended up her saying God protects the Bible from being changed, so I asked ‚Äúif God has the will and power to protect the Bible, but not his people then we should not be worshiping him. So you have to accept that the Bible is not infallible, or then you are worshiping an all powerful God who has the ability to stop atrocities but doesn‚Äôt and spends his time making sure the Bible gets translated correctly instead.‚Äù"
41,There is no benevolent god that would create an earth doomed to such violence
42,Schrodinger's God. He is both all powerful and powerless.
43,So does god have a plan or not?
44,I thought everything that happens is all pard of ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù?
45,"Holocaust victim: expressing overwhelming grief and horror in the worst circumstances imaginable 

Facebook Xtian: well aCtUaLlY"
46,"If you died in a concentration camp, how were you supposed to go on to truly enjoy the greater things in life? The logic is non-existent"
47,"I maybe no Christian ass priest ass jesus follower but did he just ..... justified Concentration camp as a relation to Jesus saying if there is bad there is good?????
If not pls explain
If yes , WHAT THE FUCK!!!"
48,"So when I get this right, the problem is not that there is no God. The problem is that he is an asshole."
49,"This was how I was brought up, the idea that it's not god but humans who have chosen to fall from grace that commit such atrocities. 
How ridiculous - all of those poor, poor, faithful people BEGGING for some help from their god as they died. This must be true for many in such dire circumstances: 'please help me god, we're being slaughtered and starved and hounded out of our very existence', but he helps not one single soul. Not one person who was a victim of wrongdoing, or sickness/injury/anything. 
And the people doing the slaughter are also his beloved creations? It's nonsensical to me that I ever was taken in by any of this, but I was"
50,That's one of the most badass quotes I've heard in a long time.
51,Two choices.  Don‚Äôt believe in god.  Or believe there is a god but either doesn‚Äôt care or is unable to be omnipotent.
52,That has to be the most badass quote I read in my life
53,"Wow, it sure is a good thing they got to experience all that pain! Think of how much joy they must have had for the rest of their lives! Wait, what do you mean most of them died and those that didn‚Äôt spent the rest of their lives with ptsd and trauma? They got all that pain, and everyone knows that life is completely fair and when you experience something that‚Äôs awful, that means something good has to happen later on!"
54,And god did nothing to help his chosen people. America wouldn‚Äôt have gotten involved without Japan bombing Pearl Harbor.
55,That quote from a concentration camp prisoner rings so true.
56,Do they believe in ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù or not? Either everything is destined and God has control over everything or he doesn‚Äôt and is just an evil piece of shit who holds magnifying glasses over ants to watch them burn
57,"‚ÄúYou have to know what one felt like to fully experience and appreciate the other.‚Äù

Hard to appreciate or experience good, joy, peace, or love when you‚Äôve been murdered and are dead."
58,This is how you get Gorr the God Butcher. This was literally his schtick.
59,"Wow, I am so glad people die and experience trauma all the time so I can learn to appreciate the little things. /s"
60,"They are aware that Hitler was a Christian who said, in 1928, ""We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity. Our movement is Christian."" The Nazis wore belt buckles that said ""God With Us"" and Hitler said that he believed, in dealing with the Jews, that he was doing the lord's work.

No, they're probably not aware of that. They're not very conversant in reality."
61,"you had to experience the holocaust, so you know how non-holocaust feels. what a stupid line of logic."
62,"I'm surprised they didn't jump at the chance to mention their god is not the true one...


(As if it made any difference...)"
63,Isn‚Äôt everything a part of god‚Äôs plan? So wouldn‚Äôt this be god‚Äôs fault?
64,Before kissing your wife goodbye be sure to slap her beforehand so she fully apreciates the kiss. #reallifehacks
65,"I must agree with this statement. If God gave us free will, he cannot control our concious decicions, hence he can't interfere in wars, murders, and other ""human"" actions. It doesn't mean that its good that the jews suffered, it means that God can only punish/reward people for their deeds/crimes after their death. I don't think that this person wanted to say something insulting."
66,"Literal backwards-ass Jigsaw logic

‚ÄúOh woops looks like you didn‚Äôt appreciate the good things you had in life, here suffer unimaginable horrors that would make anyone sick to their stomach. That‚Äôll make you appreciate life.‚Äù"
67,"As a religious person I think that the sentiment of this Jay Crownover is wrong.

If you believe in god, It‚Äôs pointless arguing whether or not God put them there, God knew what was happening to them.

If you are going to believe in God you have to accept that these things happened with Gods full knowledge"
68,"Um, the nazis were Christians-"
69,"In order to be fair and appreciate what one has. *Everyone,* should suffer some amount in their life."
70,Some ppl üôÑ
71,"Just wanna slap them and when they complain, show them they wrote that. Therefore they have no rights to complain. I'm just a messenger of God sent to test them."
72,"The Lord created all in his image. Ergo, God is also a nazi."
73,"Thing is, I agree that a life of nothing but good things would be boring, but that applies to not getting your way, losing games, and other mild negativity. But the fucking holocaust? No!"
74,"yet it's entirely 'god's' doing when they pass an exam or win a grammy?

...hmmm..."
75,"In a way, they are somewhat right because you have to have baseline comparisons.

This is not baseline. Saying that atrocities like the holocaust had to happen to understand peace is like saying I need a steaming serving of shit to know things taste bad. 

Especially if the chef claims that I‚Äôm their child. You wouldn‚Äôt serve your kid shit to eat and say it‚Äôs for their own good, a loving god should not have allowed people to die horrifically in mass."
76,"That is so messed up. Imagine feeling good about yourself and feeling ""lucky"" because you don't suffer like other people out there. If staying neutral during a terrible situation is considered to be taking the side of the oppressors for ordinary human beings then for an all powerful God who didn't give a damn when innocent people were being brutally tortured shows that God is the biggest oppressor out there. No matter what religion you follow or any God of any religion, for that God to be All merciful the holocaust shouldn't have happened. I've heard from many people that the holocaust was a form of punishment for the Jews and they deserved it!! What the actual f word?"
77,"You have to know what getting whipped in the back feels like to know what having an un whipped back feels like.

You have to drink poison to know what it's like to not drink poison.

&#x200B;

If there is a god they better PLEAD, cause all that person's life they've been taught God is good, he has a plan, never fear never worry.

That person is now about to die horrifically and God either allowed it or facilitated it."
78,Bro they‚Äôre literally trying to justify the holocaust
79,"I can imagine Satan telling god it's his turn to plead, Satan's being to it to the worst of the worst for a while, time the old man see what it's like."
80,God has given us free will to be able to choose between good and evil. I don't see what is incorrect about the comment.
81,"Tim Minchin put it best in the entirety of Thank You God, but the most pertinent passage is

""Fuck me Sam, what are the odds that of history's endless parade of gods /
That the God you just happened to be taught to believe in is the actual one /
And he digs on healing /
But not the AIDS-ridden African nations, or the victims of the plague /
Or the flood-addled Asians, but healthy, privately-insured Australians /
With common and curable corneal degeneration"""
82,">why would god help the jews though? They betrayed Jesus.

Some christian probably"
83,"Why would an ‚Äúall powerful‚Äù deity need to help? Couldn‚Äôt it have just ensured that WW2 didn‚Äôt happen? Couldn‚Äôt it have ensured that cancer never existed? What is the point of freewill if a child is born with a terminal disease? 

Amazing that religion is still a thing in 2022, and not regarded as we do the Greek gods, just fanciful thinking of ancient people who had way too much time on their hands."
84,"Would you rather have no choice, or let others have a choice? You decide..."
85,"Yeah, these obscenely fortunate people are always VERY comfortable with the horrible misfortune of others."
86,some times i like to imagine if their response would stay the same if we put them through these circumstances that they have zero experience about
87,I love absolutely anything Stephen Fry has to say about religion
88,"Plus, it's all fiction. 

Let's not forget that it was christians that built and staffed the concentration camps where jewish people were exterminated.  Literally all European nazis were christian.  

Am I supposed to be shocked that a modern day christian nazi wants to erase the entire situation and make it about their fictional god?  NO.  

Never let christian nazis whitewash history.  They're the ones responsible for the genocide."
89,Haghuubuuu something something original sin something something
90,Imagine telling GTA NPCs worship you
91,Would you rather not have a choice?
92,"Yeah. This was a person who had seen everyone they loved being tortured, starved, worked to death and killed, including their children, parents, spouse, and they themselves. That doesn't make the rest of life sweeter by contrast."
93,"Seriously, this Jay motherfucker doesn't know suffering or hate I'm willing to bet."
94,"to make matters worse, that answer was on a question titled   
[What will you say if you met the man who wrote: ""If there is a god, he will have to beg my forgiveness.""?](https://www.quora.com/What-will-you-say-if-you-met-the-man-who-wrote-If-there-is-a-god-he-will-have-to-beg-my-forgiveness)  


so we got this remorseless ""Satan like being"" that straight out wants to tell a Holocaust  genocide victim that this was for his own good   


Damn , how do we share the planet with these monsters ?"
95,"And let's not forget that the Jews are *God's chosen people.* If their ""God"" will do that to his chosen people, how the hell did Jay Whats-his-nuts skate out so easy?!?"
96,"Crownover is an author of romance novels. The quote is from her book Riveted, a story about a woman who escapes an abusive relationship to find healing among a group of friends and finally the love of a good man.

The quote in this context is hilarious because the FMC in Riveted escapes an abusive husband who uses a patriarchal view of Christianity to justify the abuse. She also escapes her abusive father who is a fanatical pastor and violent man.

Edit: I cited the right book for the quote, but attributed the wrong synopsis. Salvaged is the title I described above dealing with spiritual abuse and domestic violence. Riveted is a different book in the same series, Saints of Denver, by Jay Crownover. I enjoyed all the books in this series and would recommend."
97,"That or ""he's testing us"". ü§¢"
98,I live in a country of religious fruitcakes ... this is their exact approach.
99,"""I know your siblings just died in a mall shooting, but its all part of God's plan"""
100,The Lord is a capricious motherfucker.
