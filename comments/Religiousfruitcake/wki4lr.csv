1,">what if some 30 year old marries an 18 year old? No huge issue, right?

No, that is a huge issue. Not illegal, but major red flags. Only people who defend rapists don't see the problem with that."
2,"There are also cases where girls have gone through puberty as young as 4 (and delivered children as young as 5). If puberty is your only deciding factor, you might just be a child rapist."
3,They missed the point. So close. Painfully so. It's called grooming and assaulting a minor.
4,"Vile, vile comment. I had the displeasure of the individual in the screenshot ‚Äúdebating‚Äù with me about what constitutes peadophilia. 

These people walk amongst us y‚Äôall ü§Æ 

They should be sterilised and kept away from children."
5,"What a terrible day to have eyes and to have seen the stupid I‚Äôve seen.

Also men who date teenagers are like business men who pay minimum wage. Nothing of value is being offered and they would go lower if the law didn‚Äôt stop them."
6,He was being a gentleman s/
7,The problem with his argument is that he is conceding that the morality will change with time and hence there is no point of following an archaic system of laws.
8,"it may be unrelated, but since when is ""rape"" a curse word to star it out?"
9,Mohammned: SHE SAID SHE WAS TWELVE
10,This mohammad fellow seems like a pretty upstanding guy...
11,Girls as young as 10 years old have been married to adult men in the United States in this century.
12,[deleted]
13,It‚Äôs also known that sexual abuse in female children can kickstart puberty prematurely
14,"If it can breed, it gets my seed.
/s"
15,"Mohammad ""married"" her at 6 and their excuse for him r\*ping her at 9 is that if he was a r\*pist he would have r\*ped her at 6. What do you even begin to say to something like that? A 9 year old CANNOT consent. They just can't can't get this through their thick skulls. Him waiting a couple of years is not a sign of him not being a r\*pist. Sigh.

I left Islam as a child even before I knew about this issue. I can't fathom how anybody can remain muslim after finding out that Mohammad r\*ped a nine year old let alone go to this extent to bend over backwards to defend him over the indefensible. Sigh.

Have these guys never seen a nine year old in their life?? Their nonchalance makes me hope they never do. Sigh."
16,assuming he didn't want to tear her to the point of no return so she could be a long lasting toy ü§°
17,"It‚Äôs not a curse word, but some people are sensitive to the word and would rather not read it in full, especially if it is something they experienced"
18,"I think the youngest has been 8? The woman in florida had 4 kids raped into her by her pedophile pastor, the oldest being born when she was 9. Underground marriage. I don't even think it was in any legal document until later because, y'know, a 20-30 something y/o marrying the 8 year old he rape-pregnancied was/is seen as a big nono."
19,"Yeah right. Im 32, im going to msrty a 6 year old abd wait til hes 9. We will have a beautiful marriage. Gross. Its gross."
20,I mean look at Ohio and Republican responses to it. Eerily similar to Islam..
21,And many completely ignore or excuse the fact that he half-raped (molested) her for 3 YEARS before he fully raped her after (I assume) she had her first period to try and get her pregnant FAST. It's absurd.

23,how staring the word makes any difference when the subject is exactly about rape?
24,WHAT? WHO WAS THIS WTF
25,[deleted]
26,"Exactly, we muslims think child marriages are beautiful!! Thats why they‚Äôre still done in many muslim countries. Pre pubescent girls shouldnt be playing with dolls and going to school, they should be in bed with their 60 year old husbands"
27,"I don't even have words for this. Not only you're ignorant to it but are shamelessly defending it. 

6, can you read it? It's fucking 6 mate. A 6 yo child couldn't consent for marriage, same for 9. And go look at other cultures, the gap between the bride and the groom is not a fucking generation wide. If you couldn't comprehend that you're Prophet's a rapist, then you need to get your head checked mate. Sorry for being rude but that's how it is."
28,"Trauma affects people differently, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hard to write the word another way to be kind to others, that‚Äôs all"
29,"No they did not. In fact people went through puberty later then,than they do today due to shitty nutrition. Children have always been children. 

 By the way, im only 32, not 65. Wow! I'm closer in age to the child than the pedophile you disgustung freak who defends this. You are a pedo or a pedo defender. You make me sick. I would not have a good marriage with a 6 or 9 year old.

What universe do you live in? Maybe it was common back then, but I would not accept that from someone who claims to be a prophet who God speaks to.

God's rules or laws should be universal and that was never ok. Ever.
Im sure we do stuff now that will be looked upon as bad in the future; due to new knowlege. But if God came down and gave us revelations and laws i would expect him to kibbosh our practices that are wrong. 

I would not expect him to tell his prophet to marry a child. 

Your prophet is a false one. If there is a hell i hope he is in there burning for all eternity. üòÄ May peace be never upon him."
30,"Muhammed was 50 and Khadijah died in her 60‚Äôs. Aisha died at 67‚Ä¶? If they aged quicker they shouldve died quicker, no?"
31,"sure, but I'm questioning if it's a real problem and if you help with it at all.

is there more info about it if it's a real thing?"

This thread explains some individual‚Äôs experience with the word. If someone tells me it upsets them, it costs me nothing to help them out. Whether it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreal thing‚Äù or not doesn‚Äôt matter to me, it‚Äôs real enough to them"

35,Prove it.
36,wondering where the trend may go. will we not have significant percentage of the words starred out in any random text after a while?
37,[deleted]
38,"Are you talking about a slippery slope fallacy? People have stated they just don‚Äôt want to see the word in full, and there‚Äôs no harm in something so easy"
39,There proof im right easy as pie. You idiot.
40,"Sure there isn't, I did not even know that it hurts people, that's why I ask. not because I want to be rude or anything"

42,"I understand, and I‚Äôm glad you asked, I hope I was a bit helpful."
43,"New york times is a good source. Thry have fact checkers and get infirmation from legit sources. More than ive see from you.  Prove it. Prove your claim. May allah perish you in the hellfire.you freak! Im wrong? Your pedo prophet fucks a 9 year old and im wrong? There is no fixing stupid.
I hope you dont reproduce because  we wouldnt want more idiots in the world.

You csnt prove it. You are wrong and you are mad.

Have fun pleasing your pedo loving allah."
44,[deleted]
45,"You have wasted time responding to me. It doesnt tske any more time to show me proof.

No he was not. Sorry. You are wrong. God did not tell the pedo to marry a child. You disgust me thst you think God would do that.

I feel sorry for you. You are severely brainwashed and you have a lukewarm iq."
46,Mayve tour lukewarm iq is due to all the inbreeding which allah says is ok.
