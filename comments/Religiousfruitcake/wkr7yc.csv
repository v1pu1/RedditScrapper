1,"After reading this, I marveled and psrished."
2,Can't wait to psrish.
3,Oh yeah he's probably pissed about all the idiots here. Especially the ones who think we live in a glass dome.
4,"Stay in school kids. 

Not christian schools though."
5,"Fun fact. Im from the Balkans and when I was growing up I thought these weren't a thing until I got introduced to  American culture. Like in my country christian schools just aren't a thing. There is like one, maybe two in the whole country and most parents rather drive their kid 2 kilometers more than let them go to a christian school.

Thank fuck for Europe. Im glad no one takes religion seriously here and Im very glad I never actually believed in any of this nonsense."
6,"Oh ya, they definitely exist here. In fact, one big policy that conservatives are trying to push through is vouchers for christian schools. Basically they want taxpayer funding to go towards their kids attending private religious schools. In theory that should be unconstitutional, but conservatives have never let that stop them in the past. 

The US is weird in the sense that most people aren't practicing christians, but we have an extremely vocal minority of *devout* christians (maybe ~20% of the country) that have disproportionate control over politics. That's a big reason why the US is so politically polarized right now. 

Overall I'm jealous of how secular you all are, and wish we could undo the brainwashing these conservative christians have been raised into."
7,"see that 20 percent of devout christians here is more like 3-5 percent. Literally everyone is christian just because of tradition. Only old people go to church. I dont know a single person below 40 who prays or goes to church.

 I love many things from american culture and think you all are so cool, but god do I hate how agressive some people are when it comes to religion, politics and just violence in general. What the fuck is up with all your shooting and stuff. And dont tell me its because guns are easy to buy. If I wanted I could literally buy a gun tomorrow illegaly for 100 bucks and go shoot people. But this stuff just doesnt happen in my country, even though everyones grandpa owns a gun."
8,"Well, on the matter of violence, it helps to remember that in the US we basically worship soldiers and cops. We are raised with war movies/cop dramas that glorify violence in the name of some nebulous definition of ""justice."" Additionally, the US is an empire in decline. Our politicians are insanely corrupt, and our citizens are being left behind by a govt that cares more about endless war and international dominance than feeding/housing the poor. People sense this deep level of powerlessness, and it can cause many people to just snap. 

Ultimately, I think our mass shooter problem is caused by the intersection of political hopelessness, violent cultural subconscious, and extremely easy access to weapons. People in the US make the mistake of thinking the issue can be resolved by addressing only one or the other of these factors, but really we need to have greater control of access to guns, as well as a more equitable and human-centered society and government. Until those are both addressed, we're kinda fucked over here tbh."
