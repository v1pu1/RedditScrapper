1,"So God created these people in a way that would automatically condemn them to hell? Sounds like a great person. I've always felt more love and acceptance from ""sinners"" than I ever have from judgemental asshole Christians."
2,"Tons of hot takes in [the comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/x4saot/why_do_progay_self_proclaimed_followers_of_christ/). 

One user asks why they're so concerned about homosexuality instead of premarital sex. 

The [response](https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/x4saot/why_do_progay_self_proclaimed_followers_of_christ/imzin9c/):
>I don‚Äôt remember the last time my city had a premature [sic] sex parade

Also the OP, when asked in they're celibate if not currently in a relationship:

>huh, no, I'm recovering from self pleasure"
3,"these christians point to an important fact though. you simply can't be a gay person and love god because god just doesn't love you back lol. no matter how much you might wish that god would say cool to being gay, he's just like nah i know i made you like this but fuck you. and that's the v nature of religion. rigid as FUCK."
4,"Sadly, I have a Christian friend who thinks like this...who is gay. He said to me once he thinks that, being gay, God has called him to celibacy.

You're as surprised as I am he has a serious drinking problem."
5,"Whackos, who talks like this lol"
6,">I understand it's kinda unfair to them because they aren't heterosexual

#r/selfawarewolves"
7,"According to their book, action isn't relevant.

Thoughts and feelings are sins, whether you act on them or not.

It's one of the things that the OT and NT actually agree on. Coveting makes the top ten list, and Jesus says that to look at a woman with lust is to commit adultery in your heart.

Meanwhile, the hypocrites are also engaging in forbidden behaviour, usurping their god's role as judge. Just because you feel the desire to be a nasty, small-minded bigot doesn't mean you should therefore act upon said desire."
8,"My mom basically forces me to live with her so I can't act on it.

Either way, I already know the answer is basically you are lusting in your heart for not acting on it but having attractions to it."
9,"Maybe they should marry a gay today...to save them from  'sin'.

/s"
10,Religion is like the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway: Everything's made up and the points don't matter.
11,"""If I have to, so do they!"""
12,Why is it so much easier for some people to not be ‚Äúsinners‚Äù? That seems very strange decision by God.
13,"OP is fruitcake.

It's hipocrisy if someone is ""faithful"" christian but only obeys laws of it they find comfortable. YES GOD HATES GAYS AND YES GAYS MARRIAGES ARE JUST WAY TO RIP OFF HIPOCRYTES AS CHURCH ALWAYS LOVES MORE MONEY FROM IGNORANT"
14,"Christians went from ‚Äúbeing gay is wrong and a sin‚Äù to ‚Äúyou can be gay, you just can‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre gay.‚Äù

Why does their god change his mind all the time?"
15,And that's why the idea of God condemning homosexuals makes **absolutely no goddamned sense**.
16,"jokes on them ü§£ /s 
(i love the way you phrased  that)"
17,Haha no one tell that guy about slut walks
18,Holy shit why did I look at those comments?!
19,No one tell the guy who heterosexual sex is brazenly on display in every aspect of life.
20,"Concerning data we have, eh?"
21,"yeah being gay isnt good cause you cant flipping REPRODUCE. what good is a relationship if its just love and sex but no reproduction??? keep it between females and males gheez how hard can it be to just stick to the strict roles, humans?/s"
22,"I know one, too. He'd rather go into celibracy than become one with his lover through sex"
23,Or the fact that technically God has condemned remote indigenous tribes of people that have never heard of him before.
24,"I know you're being sarcastic but this makes me wonder what Christians think of hetero couples where one of them can't reproduce. Do they think their relationships are invalid like homosexual ones because they can't fulfill their ""natural purpose""?ü§î"
25,"Which, again, given that God is described as loving humanity, **makes absolutely no sense‚Ä¶**"
26,I guess God condemned everyone before Jesus was born. Those poor cavemen.
27,"""A woman's infertility might also be marked by the phrase ‚Äúshe had no progeny‚Äù (as in Genesis 11:30, Judges 13:2, 2 Kings 4:14). Often these biblical women suffered deep shame as a consequence, their barrenness attributed to some hidden wrong, sin, or flaw."" 
-a quick Google search"
28,"in my experience, it depends vastly. if the couple wants kids but can't reproduce, people will either look down at them and think of them as bad people being punished for their sins OR they will look at them with pity and sympathize and say just pray or something like that. 

if a couple doesn't WANT kids, then there's no kindness whatsoever. they'll just all look down on them and think of them as selfish and ostracize them. i feel like the women wear the brunt of this and will receive a lot of unsolicited advice and be asked to think about their purpose as women etc."
29,I agree. No sense whatsoever. Just venting a bit.
30,That also makes no bloody sense.
31,Yeah religion usually isn‚Äôt good at that sorta thing
32,"For every current major religion (other than Scientology, which was a freaking scam with no good intentions from the very beginning; even Islam, for all of Mohammed's faults and the many very-well-thought-out-and-logically-coherent arguments that can be made that he was also a charlatan, makes a (admittedly misguided, which is often an understatement) effort to be a genuine beacon of morality and justice to the world), you have to take into account that its dogma was established well over 1,000 years ago‚Ä¶ and that's for Islam, the newest ~~(and arguably most morally bankrupt)~~ of the world's major religions (again, other than Scientology); most other large religions are even *older*. Furthermore, most religions tend to be very, *very* reluctant to change any aspects of their dogma, even in the face of new information saying that certain parts of the dogma are unwise or inaccurate at best or flat-out immoral at worst‚Ä¶ yeah, fundies tend to be very, *very* deficient in terms of practical knowledge. And human decency."
