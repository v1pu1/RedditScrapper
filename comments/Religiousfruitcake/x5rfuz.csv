1,i don't remember any of this stuff in sunday school. has the world gone backwards or its just easier to spread nonsense with the internet?
2,I thought Eve disobeyed and ate the apple? That church can't even keep the story straight.
3,"""secular scientists"". I would hope scientists can keep their religious beliefs and science separate."
4,"Spend generations teaching people to reject observable reality and believe that they possess a truth that the rest of the world is conspiring to take away from them, is it any surprise why these people are so vulnerable to getting sucked into things like QAnon?"
5,"Just a fun fact: marine animals would also die out if a flood that huge were to happen because adding water the height of mount everest increases the water pressure so much most of them will just be crushed on the spot, and yes I know it didn't happen immediately but 40 days is not gonna be enough for them to adapt and even if they could, most ocean life can't even move"
6,Ok so I finally get it... all the times I've given them shit for all the diseases and untimely deaths of innocent people.. it was all because of Adam eating an apple.  It all makes sense now.
7,Looks like a YEC church and their typical dribble.
8,"If you go to a fruitcake church, does that make you a fruitcake by association?"
9,"Consider this too: if the Earth was 6,000 years old, how did the Bible come to be only 2,000 years ago. The mental gymnastics of these people is worth an Olympic Gold medal."
10,Leave
11,"That look on their face as they see Adam and Steve eat the fruit

12,Honestly this is terrifying…
13,was gonna say this looks like something from AIG then realized it is from AIG
14,Yes.
15,I think it’s a more fundamentalist view
16,"Yeah, but it really only mattered when Adam did because Eve was a yucky girl."
17,They both did Adam ate the apple after eve
18,"Would it also kill marine life dependent in salinity?

The average depth of the ocean is just over a third of that of Mt Everest, so the total water would more than quadruple (as it would cover more surface area than the current oceans), so the salinity would be less than a quarter of what it is now."
19,No because you realize what they're saying is bullshit if you admit it. And honestly I'm forced to go to church
20,Yes because you’d need to be a fruitcake to go to one
21,"Full-blown atheist here, but that's terrible logic. 

2000 years ago is when Jesus was supposed to have existed. Christians believe in a world before Jesus and half of the Bible is based on a world before Jesus. And that half comes from an older book.

Creationists are dumb as fuck, but this comment wasn't far off."
22,At this point you might as well give them the world record and call it a day.
23,Yeah but there's also way more water so the salt levels would stay the same...well untill the animals start dying
24,That sucks man. I was forced when I was a kid. At least you’re smart enough to see past the bullshit
25,Unless you’re a kid whose parents make you go.
26,Well thanks for clearing that up. Atheist too and still learning about different religions and their text. Sorry if my comment was dumb. I am that sometimes.
27,You didnt read my other comment did you?
28,"Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

Whether it's fair or not, given most atheists come to be who they are through critical thinking, I tend to hold the atheist community to a higher standard."
