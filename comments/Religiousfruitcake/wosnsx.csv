1,"I deleted a lot of forgotten stuff in my clipboard. This though is getting a lot of use.

iSlAm Is ThE rElIgIoN oF pEaCeðŸ¤¢"
2,And then they cry whenever we say ISIS represents Islam
3,Imagine if islam was never born. Someone shut muhammad up the moment he opened his disgusting mouth. The world would have been so different.
4,May Allah ðŸ’© upon you.
5,"Islam is a vile religion. These times show us what the effects of islam on it's followers are. 



They are willing to use violence and murder people  if their fairy tale gets slightly insulted. 



It would be great if all muslims move to the middle east and we build a huge wall around it. 



Let's check in about 300 years if they learned how to behave yet."
6,Try living among them (p.s. don't)

8,"He failed though, and now due to the streisen effect, its in the spotlight again. This is an undeniable loss for islam. Its so weird they celebrate it."
9,"In India, a woman spoke about Muhammad marrying a 6-year old. There was a huge row about it. So much so that in some parts of India, a few Muslims even beheaded people who said that they agreed with her."
10,These people are delusional on a whole new level.
11,"At least now we know that yes, most Muslims are violent and they will try to hurt others. Stay safe yâ€™all"
12,Look they actually [made a movie about murdering him in 1990 and got away with it. ](https://youtu.be/fFSi7e2wq70)
13,who the fuck is salaman rushdie I'm seeing him everywhere in this sub
14,"The passive aggressiveness these people have is sickening.

Basically the christian equivalent of saying ""god bless you"" after making a vileful statement."
15,"He probably never even existed.

You would have to kill every one lf the thousands of people spreading the myth."
16,"Wipe their memories and make them believe there's no other people out there except themselves in their own walls.

(AOT reference if anyone hasn't figured it out)"
17,"""no one else should point it out except us, bc unlike the kuffars, we glorify our prophets actions, and the prophet is an attention whore who likes to be praised"""
18,"An ex-Muslim author who wrote the book 'Satanic Verses' 33 years ago, he criticizes islam in his book."
19,"I think its very likely that he did exist. Only because there are way too many convenient verses revealed only to serve mohammed. The most notorious is 33:53 where GOD tells mohammeds followers to not overstay his welcome in his house as MOHAMMED is too shy to tell them to leave. It is then followed up by GOD saying that no one can marry MOHAMMEDS wives after he dies.

Idk bro if this isn't a cult leader moment I dont know what is."
20,">He probably never even existed.

That could be said about any historical figure and it's pretty ignorant to say it without providing any source/reason. Anyone could saw ''Issaac Newton probably never existed''"
21,They want someone to die for critiquing their religion?
22,"I will rephrase: there is not a single reliable and contemporary source about jesus.

We have thousands for isaac newton"
23,Wouldn't be the first nor the last time unfortunately.
