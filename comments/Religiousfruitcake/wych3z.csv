1,"Oh don't worry, as a left wing secular I have no problems completely dismissing the bible as just a piece of horrible fiction on which no actions should be based."
2,I for real wonder why they use Majira Strawberry.
3,"Oh yeah? After a year of reading about scientific thought and many sleepless nights, I've decided that all religions are silly. 

Checkmate."
4,"Mfs be like ""yeah just throw a fursuit photo in there for no reason""
Kinda funny how each time you see one of these examples of ""FuRrY bAD"" it's always Majira lmfao"
5,"I actually did read it all when I was a teen and was questioning it.

I'm kind of surprised more of them don't read the entire bible cover to cover considering how infinitely important they think it is. I mean , the secrets to all the universe, and with eternal Ultimate reward or punishment at stake? Surely that merits taking a few weeks to read the whole thing.

But it's a mess. It contradicts itself constantly. The historical assertions that can be tested mostly aren't true. The claims about God are contradictory. The morals are too.

It's pretty obvious it's just a compilation of a bunch of different stuff cherry picked by powerful people to help maintain control."
6, If I can disprove your book and argue against the basis of your religion using google and win. Then maybe your book isn't as infallible as you seem to think it is? Then again that'd actually take some insight on their part. Which many in my experience seem to lack.
7,"Wanna know what, if there could be, their common agreement of what the gospels meaning are. Because theyve been fighting about that since at least martin luther."
8,"Many ex-christians became ex-christians not because they studied the bible too little, but because they studied it too much. Many of us have decades of bible study experience, and some of us (not me) are seminary-graduated pastors and priests."
9,"6 minutes is still better than 0 minutes, which is the amount right wing Christians have spent reading the bible"
10,"Reminder that:

\- Jesus was homeless

\- Jesus was a refugee

\- Jesus was more than likely Arab

\- Jesus supported socialized healthcare

\- Jesus supported forgiving debts and loans

\- Jesus supported socialized food services

\- Jesus was accused of being a socialist, and put to death for it"
11,Nowadays most people just acknowledge its full of outdated ideas and just abandon it.
12,I love how the furry pic is also in there
13,Ted kaczynski?
14,"Hey you found r/anarchism / r/COMPLETEANARCHY !

&#x200B;

^(Seriously, those dumb shits somehow forgot one of their most famous mottos was ""No gods, no masters."")"
15,"6 minutes is, on average, longer than the amount of time anyone who opens their argument with “I’ve done my research” spends actually “researching”"
16,"I like to think that the Christian Bible was just an elaborate fictional book, never intended to have any particular meaning. But then people found it and translated it to what it is today fully believing it's true and based on real events. It's just funny to me lol."
17,"You could always just tell them Jesus was a lazy unemployed sponge that was lucky enough to have miracle powers otherwise he’d have just been another Judean Charles 
Manson-type. He was a business ruining moocher."
18,"Jokes on them. As a leftist, I don't cherry pick scripture to justify my beliefs. I dismiss all of it."
19,Right because they really care about knowing what the Bible says…
20,"W.. wait.. I thought this was a secular person making this meme.  
Honestly, if you take just 6 minutes to read the bible, you'll realize Jesus would vote Bernie, be BLM, communist, LGBT accepting, etc. 

Maybe even a furry! I heard he crafted his own cross-sona. 

I'm guessing the creator of the meme was actually trying to say ""If you just READ the bible it clearly states all these things I am uncomfortable with, lol, idiots, you have to do intense mental gymnastics to make it fit your worldview and excuse your lifestyle!""  
(Grew up Christian, I know the ropes)"
21,"Why are you boo-ing them they are right? Geographically speaking Jesus probably looked a bit like that, He did have a ""Beloved apostle"" that he gave special care to and looked at while he was dying (totally gay) and he gave people free food and drink (Communism)

&#x200B;

I know it sounds ridiculous but the second pannel is actually pretty accurate

&#x200B;

Although I don't see what a furry has to do with Jesus maybe I have not read enough bible translations lol"
22,"so i studied christianity at a liberal secular college, which was a joke, then went to an elite evangelical seminary and actually learned the bible. this meme is kinda right. dont go around thinking you know the bible better than these people just because someone told you jesus was actually a socialist or whatever. reject it, sure, but dont pretend you understand the fucking bible better than these people who study it every fucking day, youre just embarassing yourself. trust me, they know it pretty good."
23,education level is the best predictor.  znuff said.
24,"omg yea I know nothing not like I've studied and grew up learning the Bible and it's ins and outs for about 17 years. you're right, I know nothing! /s"
25,Wait why are furries involved?
26,"Six minutes not needed, five at most."
27,I find it silly that these guys object to Jesus not being whiter than wonderbread.
28,I spent entire 12 minutes and found nothing worth knowing. Just bronze era goat herder made up bullshit.
29,What took him so long?
30,"jesus literally *was* a hippie, though. the right wing fundamentally opposes his values."
31,“Judge not lol” well at least they’re saying the quiet part out loud: “we don’t actually believe in any of this bullshit; we just like terrorizing people and using religion as a hallpass to do so.”
32,"I don't get it, why do people hate prown Jesus? Seriously why?"
33,"I mean, after six minutes I certainly could see enough to know it was total bollocks.  And I first read a Bible as a small child.  I knew instantly it was total rubbish."
34,"Imagine the worst fandom possible. Then imagine the worst subset of this worst fandom, which enjoyed a millennium of murdering anyone they thought was getting their source material wrong, but had been now reduced to nonsensical arguments about how the things they say are true because they *really want them* to be true and are still bitter about it.

You probably don't need me to tell you that these same people have a pedophilia problem older than a lot of countries, but constantly label people they don't like as ""groomers""."
35,*a compilation of several discordant pieces of horrible fiction.
36,Majira Strawberry is biblical figure confirmed 😳😳😳
37,"Fr lol, they can at least use a furry that's actually bad. Poor Majira"
38,"There are bunch of bibles too because it wasn't originally English so a lot got lost, changed and added in translation

&#x200B;

If some one is a true christian they should learn hebrew so they  can read copies of the original lol"
39,hmm... the right wing christians you know are not the right wing christians i know
40,Pretty sure he lived in the same country all his life.
41,ok lets not prove their post here please
42,"Everything is right except the arab part. The language spoken in Palestine was some sort of Aramean, a semitic language only distantly related to Arabic.

>Jesus was accused of being a socialist, and put to death for it

He was also a threat to the roman administration who saw him as a Jewish agitator able to raise the populace against them."
43,Thats the scientifically accurate depiction of jesus as he was a Palestinian rabbi
44,"Industrial Society and Its Future By Theodore John Kaczynski

Introduction

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries."
45,"It's probably because they think it's somehow some left-wing point of view to make Jesus of color. Either way, the 10 Commandments do say thou shall create no graven imagery so any represention of Jesus would be bad but they are comfortable with the European's view of Jesus."
46,*that has been heavily edited down through the ages by como of serving the church's (leaders') interests and also bad translation.
47,"""But english is the best language and I don't want to learn another one!1!!!11!1!1!!111!!1!1!11"" - Basically every american 'true' christian

Wtf even is a true christian anyways?"
48,Do the right wing Christians you know all have degrees in theology?
49,"nope. Remember, he had to flee to Egypt in order to escape Herod. Thus making him a refugee."
50,"you do realize that Arab means ""dweller of the desert""

also, I know we don't exactly have Galilean Jews to look at but it would be a big stretch to say that Jesus was white."
51,"Wait, someone edited that shit???  HOW DID THEY NOT NOTICE THE LONG BORING GENEALOGIES?"
52,"well, a lot of them do, and a lot of the church ppl i know study the bible directly and in-depth several times a week... which i certainly didnt do in my undergrad theology courses at a liberal school.

in my masters theology degree on the other hand, i studied the bible daily, verse by verse, in the original languages with fundamentalists. i left that world entirely, but it certainly wasn't because they didn't know their fucking bibles lol. quite the opposite."
53,Pretty sure his family did the rituals and went back to Nazareth.
54,"The Semitic speaking tribes that are now known as the original Arabs (those who first converted to islam and lead conquest for it) were and are separated while related from the Hebrew and Arameans of Roman Palestine. 

>it would be a big stretch to say that Jesus was white.

Never said or implied that."
55,"Well, if you noticed you got burned at stake, soooo..."
56,"I know a handful of people who knew the Bible inside and out but I wouldn't call them ""right wing"". I've notice once you really study it in depth none of the things the right wing politicians say the Bible teaches make sense. The more you read into it the more the doctrine of love and forgiveness outshine everything else, at least thats what I've been told and personally experienced. It's hilarious seeing these right wing ""Christians"" completely twisting or out right fabricate claims taken from the Bible to suit their hateful and regressive agenda. Charity doesn't exist in their dictionary."
57,"assuming the bible is entirely true, he left for egypt.

of course that's my mistake."
58,"i dont disagree with your evaluation of right-wing christianity and especially right-wing politicians. but in my opinion the bible is, legitimately, a wildly intolerant book, albeit a conflicting and often unclear one. i think the efforts to interpret it in a 21st century friendly way are often built on a lot of smugness but very little compelling textual evidence."
59,"I think it's a case of it not being internally consistant, since I think one of the books has them leave for Egypt and the other they just do the rituals associated with birth and then go back home to Nazareth.  I go with the latter because it makes more sense when his last name is ""of Nazareth"", and always whenever he's said to be ""from"" anywhere, it's Nazareth.   In my opinion the historical Jesus was probably born in Nazareth, and then preached apocalypticism, gathered a few followers, and then was crucified by the Romans when he came to Jerusalem for the first time.  He mostly preached in the eastern side of the country too."
60,"Maybe it's just my religious upbringing, since my denomination focused on the charity and redemption part of the Bible rather than the war crimes and Jesus being a ""man of war"". It doesn't help that like you said the Bible often contradict itself and numerous ways one may interpret a passage. Pastors had their hands full debating which had the superior understanding of the book."
