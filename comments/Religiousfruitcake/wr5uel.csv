1,"As funny as it is to see a retort involving the FSM, the premise that a god or gods are the source of morality is quite a stretch. Especially in the case of the Abrahamic deity. In which case, his followers proudly disobey his instructions and have a whole slew of apologetics to justify it."
2,Fear of divine retribution is not morality
3,"(1) If Star Wars isn't real, then galaxies far far away aren't real.

(2) galaxies far far away are real

(3) Star Wars is real"
4,"Weird how religious people believe that religion is what created morality. 

Is it so difficult not to kill/murder, not to steal/rob, etc. it’s logic to me."
5,That’s some real 1st year philosophy logic there
6,Perfectly valid logic can prove any impossibility to be true if you start off with false assumptions.
7,Ramen.
8,No one scares me more than people who don't have inner morals without God
9,"correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't morality stolen from god when Eve supposedly partook of the forbidden fruit? That act of rebellion is what granted humanity free will and the ability to choose between good and evil actions.

My point is, god is a massive totalitarian dick and should not be blindly followed if the bible is to be believed."
10,"When I looked up at the sky today I found myself going ""ah, the sun exists, which is evidence Ra & co continue to be victorious over Apothis even after all these thousands of years."""
11,May we forever be blessed by his noodly appendage.
12,The arch linux profile picture really sets the stage
13,You know that people lack critical thinking skills when the only organizations in the world that protect pedophilia are churches but they claim religion makes people moral.
14,"Of all the silly word games that these clowns play, their reason for believing is almost always “my parents raised me that way”."
15,"Another one to mock christian fruitcakes from me:

(1) If Barbie does not exist, blonde haired women does not exist.

(2) Blonde haired women exist.

(3) Barbie exists."
16,Pretzel logic
17,"1. If Odin does not exist, Ice Giants will overrun the earth.
2. Ice Giants do not exist.
3. Therefore, Odin exists."
18,"Is it moral because God commands it or does God command it because it's moral?

If the former, God could command torture, genocide, whatever, and it would be moral because he commands it.

If the latter, than there exists a reason and morality to point to outside of God thus he is unnecessary to its discovery and adherence.

If you object to the first point by saying 'God would never command those things' then you admit there's some law or order he's adhering to outside of his whim and thus the latter must be true."
19,All hail the Flying Spaghetti Monster!
20,"Yes.  They both exist .  And let me be clear.  Joseph was either stupid or smart.  Mary sits him down and says “ I’m pregnant “.   He says “but I haven’t fucked you, how could you be pregnant?”  She says,”I know,  I can’t explain why I’m pregnant, it’s probably because of all the talk about the son of god that Is supposed to arrive.  

He buys it.  He’s all in on the virgin birth.  He accepts it.  He’s convinced.  My wife is pregnant but I never fucked her.  He’s a fucking dumbass. 

Or because there were several individuals claiming  to be the son of god  roaming the streets and  performing magic and professing peace Joseph saw an opportunity.   The actual bible was written by men who were not there.  They just took codified laws from the The Code of Hammurabi.  The people who wrote the Bible were just early lawmakers and today we see how that turned out.  The Vatican is responsible for many crimes.  They also hold vast amounts of real estate globally.  And they’re sovereign.  Vatican City cannot be touched.  They also have gospels that are “lost “,  we will never see them.  They were written a long time ago.  It’s all tax free.  Probably the most corrupt entity this planet has ever seen.  Period."
21,"1) conditional I made up
2) conditional I made up is true
3) profit"
22,Ra-men!
23,This is why I love paganism there are no claims like this.
24,Don’t know why they can’t grasp the fact that you can be moral without the threat of eternal hellfire.
25,"Ah yes, affirming the consequent.

&#x200B;

If an animal is a dog, then it has four legs.  
My cat has four legs.  
Therefore, my cat is a dog."
26,"Moral knowledge exists because of the serpent… god forbade that fruit, remember?  Hail Satan."
27,"I use Arch, btw!"
28,"I don’t care what anyone says, the only question you should be asking these people is how can they support a church that refuses to punish rampant pedophilia. No matter what they post, always ask/redirect to pedophiles. It’s the most important and disgustingly ignored issue regrading christianity."
29,"Religious morality is just rules: Do this and be rewarded. Do that and be punished. That's exactly how we get dogs to stop shitting on the carpet.

I would say that being good just because it's good it's wayyyy more moral than being good from fear of punishment."
30,Literally the first book of the bible says we gained the intrinsic knowledge of good and evil from eating from the tree of knowledge. The Bible itself says morality comes from within and we cannot remove it.
31,As a dudeist I believe in Speghetti monster!
32,Their god supported slavery. No moral knowledge to be found there.
33,"Morality doesn't come from religions. Religions come from human nature which developed during the process of evolution.""Morality"" comes from evolution."
34,I just don’t understand how that person thought that was a compelling argument to begin with.
35,"Those who do not worship a god and who do good acts are acting out of the goodness of their own heart and truly believe what they are doing is right, as they have no god to answer to"
36,Reminds me of that guy who asked atheists why they didn’t indulge in their darkest desires (his examples were rape and a few others that i can’t remember) if they don’t believe in a god.
37,"Man, I love Pastafarianism"
38,"right there.. thinking morality is the same as piety. 

a lot of the child abusers are pious men. ""no, they are not true religious people. but I am"""
39,"If the bogeyman doesn't exist then bogeys don't exist, bogeys exist, bogeyman exists"
40,SPAGHET!
41,the guy's logic carries as much water as does a colander.
42,Ramen
43,"Is this a syllogism?    
Like if humans are 60% water, and Jesus can walk on water, I am 60% Jesus because I can walk on humans"
44,"yeah sure Cameron, but you forgot to prove how moral knowledge is linked with the existence of God, so even your first premise doesn't make any fucking sense whatesoever, not talking about the rest of your reasoning."
45,"Ah yes the test of the pink elephant. All Elephants are pink. Nelly is an elephant. Therefore Nelly is pink.

Except Elephants aren’t pink. If your premise is bullshit, your conclusion is bullshit"
46,"I guess for God rape, murder and pedophilia is moral knowledge"
47,If religion is the only thing keeping you from becoming a psychopath... that says a lot about you and about our society...
48,I hate how religious people act like their religion is the only source for morals.  Like seriously it's not that hard.  Would I like to be murdered... No...  Probably shouldn't do that to others.
49,Ramen brother.... ramen
50,Show me the surprisingly round venn-diagram of people who use implications to prove a point and people who have no idea how implications work.
51,It's a logical fallacy even setting aside the highly dubious nature of the premise. It's a modus tollens. Can't even get a fake argument right.
52,"His first point is literally an opinion

His confusion is understable, conservatives often can't tell opinion from fact"
53,"(1) If Bigfoot does not exist, animals do not exist. 

(2) Animals exist. 

(3) Bigfoot exists"
54,"""The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith, I am nothing.' 'But, says Man, the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and vanishes in a puff of logic.""   
  
-Douglas Adams"
55,"God is all knowing, all powerful, and all loving

Yet he changed his creation and what laws his people should follow, thus God is either not all knowing, not all powerful, or not all loving"
56,"Morality is subjective tho, just like right and wrong, good and bad - moral knowledge does not exist.

Camerdumb Berstupid is a bigger moron than this post implies."
57,"Yeah, imma have to stop you at (1) there…"
58,I don't know if Bertuzzi is just ignorant or purposefully dishonest. Can't stand the guy.
59,It takes more than 1 day of class in philosophy 101. . .
60,False. Implies. Anything.
61,Holy crap. Everyone should be forced to take a proof class. This is not how it works.
62,I don’t get it... the Flying Spaghetti Monster IS real ya all trippin if you think it’s fake
63,Deep fried to spaghetti Valhalla and back
64,These people are losing morals at a rate of a few per year. So pretty soon this argument will be obsolete
65,D: Collective moral knowledge does not exist.
66,"His logic would be correct, if part A was a fact, which it is not."
67,"Ignoring a bit that the first premise is false, he's basically saying:

If X then Y

Y is true

Therefore X is true.

That's not how this works, you gotta prove X to prove Y, not the opposite."
68,"Leaves 'moral knowledge' totally undefined, starting from a false premise. Fell at the first hurdle."
69,PLEASE someone teach him that this is not how Modus Ponens works.
70,"Why'd you hide the likes, we wanted to see the ratio"
71,"1. If God does not exist
2. ?? 
3. Profit"
72,Just looked this up and realized this is not referring to cthulhu
73,"Silly-gism, kinda like a syllogism only without the logical consistency."
74,What a weak attempt to justify it
75,Equivalent.
76,"(1) If you God exists, moral knowledge does not exist
(2) Moral knowledge exists
(3) God does not exist"
77,I fucking hate that reasoning. You don’t need to believe in a celestial being to not be a total piece of shit.
78,Pastafarianism wins once again!
79,If you need religion to have morals then you really don't have morals.
80,"The fallacy is affirming the consequent. Has nothing to do with religion

https://fallacyinlogic.com/affirming-the-consequent/#:~:text=Affirming%20the%20consequent%20is%20a,structure%2C%20rendering%20the%20conclusion%20invalid"
81,You just changed my religion...
82,"It's funny because from a pure logical perspective he said if n`ot(B) implies not(A) then A implies B`, which is true but he used literally the same proposition to demonstrate a proposition he didn't prove shit lmao"
83,Whoa I beetlejuiced - this is my destiny.
84,"If the bible is the sole source of our understanding of morality, then slavery is moral. If we're to believe it's immoral then God must've decided it was. That would mean God wanted Lincoln to free the slaves and those that rose up against him rose against God. Surely those that don't have the favor of God would lose, and the confederates did. This means those who raise the flag of the confederacy are raising a flag against and denying God.

Confederate waving evangelicals are the antichrist confirmed."
85,Why not both?
86,"3 would follow if 1 was true but it isn't so yeah, logic a bit harder christian"
87,Ramen!
88,"I don’t get this argument. Morals are a social construct. People who aren’t socialized the same don’t have the same morals and in extremely rare cases there have been people who were so isolated they developed no understanding of moral behavior. The concept of *THIS* against *THAT* (Good against Evil, Us against Them, Light against Dark…) is directly the result of tribal unity"
89,Hello Sir do you have a moment to talk about our savior the flying spaghetti Monster ?
90,The former philosophy/symbolic logic tutor in me nearly had a stroke looking at this
91,"If nothing exists god doesn't exist.
Something exists
God exists"
92,"Such an asinine line of reasoning. If this is the claim, he's going to have to provide a precise, working definition of what ""moral knowledge"" is, then he's going to need to prove it exists, and *then* he's going to need to prove it could only exist because of a god.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say he can't do even one of these things."
93,Don't need God to have morals. Many so called Christians have morals for 1 hour per week and none for the rest.
94,"So since you believe in a god, is that what keeps you from going on a killing spree or is there another reason you don’t go on a killing spree?  🤔"
95,"1. If God existed, then God would exist and his existence would be self evident, and idiotic syllogisms wouldn't be needed.
2. Your tweet exists
3. Therefore God doesn't exist"
96,"It terrifies me how many people like this are openly admitting that if they didn’t have religion, they would have no morals. That the only thing keeping them from raping and pillaging are the moral rules imposed on them by an organization."
97,bud uses arch btw
98,"Kinda creepy when you remember that the majority of religions were founded by pedophiles. I'm looking at you, Muslims and Mormons 😒"
99,That would still prove the existence of a god. Just by different names.
100,Moral knowledge does not exist. If we knew morality there simply wouldn't be any debating it. What is moral is dependent on information that will always be somewhat obscured by the limitations of our individual human experience.
