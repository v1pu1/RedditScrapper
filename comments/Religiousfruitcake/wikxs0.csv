1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"But... but...

Isn't that the whole thing about religion? Don't enjoy now, because you have to worry about your fate after you die? (You know, and judge others when they seem to enjoy anything...)"
2,"Then why am I more worried about God and his fan club, than I am about Satan?"
3,"Live a less fulfilling life now, so that you can have your reward in heaven! Delayed gratification is better.

Also, don't worry about the future so much, just enjoy living now."
4,The devil sounds an awful lot like my inner self hate.
5,While I do not speak for all Satanists I can assure you the ones I stand with do not want you to worry about anything; that is why we fight for your freedom and prosperity even when you fight to deny the same to others.
6,"My ~~somewhat~~ mostly hypocritical version \^ \^ ' :

'Don't procrastinate(Favor Tomorrow), do pronunkinate(Favor Now).

Also consider that what's done now may have consequences for tomorrow.

Live in the moment while still cementing tomorrow.

As for worry try to cool the jets when they overheat, keep 'er going post rest or an assist.'"
7,"Almost all these ""inspirational"" quotes seem so nihilistic."
8,"Ah yes, it's the devil that wants you to worry about where you go in the afterlife."
9,homework is the devil then?
10,"The thing is, the first part actually works - up until the point where the fruitcakes bring in God - if you swap out “The Devil” and replace it with “your anxiety.”"
11,"If you remove god and the devil from this, it would be some pretty good advice"
12,Because giving a fuck is eViL
13, If I spent my every waking moment worrying about death or if I sin by enjoying something I'm sure I'd constantly be anxious  to live life in any form. Oh wait that's a lot  of Christians that I've encountered on reddit.  So what was that about the devil making people focus on the future and creating anxiety. Yeah you religious people have fun with your worry.
14,Uuuhhh just focus on the present… and don’t worry about god… he does not care about life
15,"Yeah, if they really believed what they said they’d wake up and say: Shit, I’m still alive"
16,"Nah.

Christians have Jesus."
17,Cause God and his fan club want everyone else to become part of their varying hivemind called a religion.
