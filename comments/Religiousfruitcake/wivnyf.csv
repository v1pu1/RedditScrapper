Whoa, I'm gonna stop you right there. I don't need to hear anything more. Thanks for your testimony and have a nice day."
2,"Lost me at ""we were on LSD"""
3,"This reminds me of something I recently read in a book on people discovering a personal connection to the spiritual. I’m in recovery and the book was about other people in early recovery having spiritual experiences that helped them find ways to stay clean. All I could think of while reading it was of course these people are seeing god and hearing voices, I was bat shit insane at that point in sobriety as well. Coming off of daily drug use, d.t.’s, and all sorts of cravings causing extreme anxiety will play all sorts of tricks on a persons perception of reality."
4,Friend that's the LSD Fun fact hallucinogens aren't so much fun when  you start having reoccurring flashbacks or see terrifying things that aren't there.
5,Flashbacks are a terrible thing.
6,I've tripped over a dozen times. Never met a demon once. So disappointed.

8,Don't psychedelics make you feel like you have some sort of spiritual experience?
9,"Congratulations on being in recovery! If you wouldn’t mind sharing, what is the title of the book?"
10,"I hallucinated Kris Kristofferson nailed to the prow of a tall ship, holding an American flag and screaming.  A demon would have been a welcome relief.

Haven't had a flashback for 45 years, though."
11,"Why are you asking me? I've never dropped acid. Hear that, FBI?"
12,"Came to Believe, I was a little harsh on it in my description. There are plenty of stories that I found helpful."
13,Thank you!
