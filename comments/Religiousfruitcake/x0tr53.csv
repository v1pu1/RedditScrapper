1,I would prolly take being killed over being a sex slave if I was a woman tbh.
2,So males suffer from religious control and women suffer from that and control of men who make the rules.
3,It's more accurate to call people like this supporters of Male Mediocrity rather than Male Supremacy because they want to be shit and don't want anyone to criticize them
4,I saw that. I’d rather be killed than to be a sex slave.
5,"Exactly. I'm sure those women are living their best lives getting taken from their family and friends likely forever, and raped repeatedly and treated like garbage by people who view them as subhuman. /s"
6,"Yeah I'm surprised Islam is still alive in the modern society. 

If I ever get to be a global leader, my first choice would be to make Islam obsolete. Even hunger and poverty comes second when religion is taken into account and that tells a lot on how harmful it is. 

Before someone says I'm Islamophobic, yes I am. I would take that all day instead of supporting oppression of innocent women because men can't keep their dicks in their pants. 

And I am a man."
7,Same I’m fully willing to say I hate Islam. Not all it’s practitioners I have Muslim friends but I like them in spite of their religion. It’s savage
8,">oppression of innocent women

The problem is not with the faith itself, the problem is the extremists who have perverted it for their own reasons (I.e they need to over compensate for a tiny dick, or because they just can't keep ot in their pants)

Here's a really interesting TED talk on the topic of women's dress and oppression in Islam."
9,"And pray tell, how would you accomplish that, Mr. Final Solution To The Muslim Question?"
10,"Yeah, I don't hate the people, just the ideology."
11,">The problem is not with the faith itself, the problem is the extremists who have perverted it

The one who never read any islamic scripture, I have a bad news for you what you call extremists we call it practising muslim in islam"
12,">The problem is not with the faith itself

While I partially agree with you, I think the faith is problematic too. It encourages such behaviour. The extremists are the ones who actually go by the book.

I'll take a look at it. Thanks."

They go by their interpretation of the book, which, as is mentioned in the YouTube video, some got creative with the interpretation, but the same can be said about those who go by the book in Christianity (for example). Which could be said about a lot of religions such a Christianity, where as the years progressed some groups have a completely different interpretation of what the Bible says, and the way they used to transcribe the Bible into a new book (long before modern book bindings etc) things would get miss written and left out."
14,">They go by their interpretation of the book, which, as is mentioned in the YouTube video,

I agree some interpret it in the wrong way but you can't deny that the book has questionable morals to say the least."
15,">They go by their interpretation of the book, which, as is mentioned in the YouTube video, some got creative with the interpretation, but the same can be said about those who go by the book in Christianity (for example).

For muslims Quran is literal and very clear word of Allah and isn't open to interpreation and it is supposed to be universal, timeless. İt isn't same with christianity."
16,"So does the Christian Bible, and the Torah.

You'll probably find that most religions have similar thoughts behind them, like be kind to your neighbors and kill or shun gay people.

Personally religion is not for me. Though if you need to believe in something bigger than yourself to make you fell ok about death go for it. But when it's the only thing stopping you from doing something that is morally wrong then it's a problem or is the thing driving you to do something that is morally right (I.e helping the stranger who fell in the street) then it a problem."
17,"Of course. Completely agree. I'm not against one single religion, I specified one here because it's related to the post but I know all of them have problems. 

It has some good parts as well like being kind etc but the cons outweigh the pros imo. Plus, the good parts in it can exist independently outside of it as well. 

Anyways, I'm fine when people keep it to themselves and not cause harm to others."
18,"Say what you will, but at least those people have *something* pushing them to do the right thing."
19,You shouldn't need magical sky daddies to tell you to do the right thing
