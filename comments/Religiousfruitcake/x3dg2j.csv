1,"How about civilizations that pre-dated the supposed global flood and continued on as if it never happened? Chinese, Peruvian, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, et al.

Hows that for proof that brings down a ""house of cards?"""
2,"There's one theory about the prevalence of flood stories in the Middle East and southern Asia, concerning a possible meteor strike off the coast of Madagascar. So far, it is only speculation because of the crater shapes found in the Indian Ocean, either the Mascarene Basin or the Crozet Basin. However, the kind of tsunami it would produce could easily match the sudden rise of water and the eventual recession of same these stories promote.

3,"Instructions unclear, began a new playthrough of Halo."
4,"Geological evidence disproves the Flood even faster than  actually reading the Bible and using common sense (food requirements for the animals and water covering the highest mountains meaning Noe surfed on the ""chill"" 8000 meters above sea level). The earth layers are great because you can easily find rough ages of things you dig out purely by depth - if fossils A are found at a certain depth and fossils B usually show up closer to the surface then you can tell whatever was fossil B is a younger species than what became fossil A. Simple stuff. Now, you can tell there was a catastrophic flood somewhere in the past when you find layers which are normally distinct everywhere else mixed together in this one particular location. So pray tell me, why do we see distinct layers from a certain time span when they should be completely mangled together due to a flood that moved many times more water that even exists on our planet all over the world? We should have found a huge layer with loads of stuff mixed together that would probably vary in thickness depending on the region and yet it seems trillions of tons of liquid didn't displace anything. A miracle I guess?"
5,"A repository of *physical* evidence of the flood? What's the facebook equivalent of a tumbleweed rolling by, because I predict that's the only thing this repository would contain.

Got to admire their optimism though, proving the flood and thus destroying evolution... wait, did I say admire? I meant laugh at."
6,"This is sad
There is evidence of a flood but the bible story was stolen from mesopotamia but there is evidence of a flood around the time in the old mesopotamian myth,
And the existence of many flood myths do mean it happened to a lot of costal areas the evidence is a meteor impact in Greenland that would have melted a lot of ice and cause rapid rise in sea levels and lots of flooding. Doesn't mean gods real tho just that rocks hit us and we made stories about the effects of the impact."

8,"We pastafarians consider that anything older than 3000 years is not genuine, put there by Quob to test our faith.


Dinosaurs bones, pyramids, ground stratas, oceans, photons, stars, etc. : all part of Quob's scheme to test us..."
9,"Just no, the fact that there are a lot of flood myths, means that a lot of places get floods. There is absolutely no reason to assume all flood myths somehow relate to a single real event. There was a big flood event in the Iraqi flood plain, that may have inspired the myths of that local area, but it has nothing to do with a meteor impact. Meteors don’t carry water either, that’s comets… And meteors are not quite as hot upon landing as people may believe. It wouldn’t melt much ice. I’m sorry, but you’ve been listening to some bad sources.."
10,"It isn't a meteor. It is jsut the ending of the last ice age. And it wasn't one event either. Yes, there is evidence of flooding in many places, and many cultures have flood myths. But the dates to line up for any of them other then ones from in the same area. And that makes sense with the ice age ending. It wasn't all at once. Melt started in some places, and over time caused floods. Over centuries. And not all of them would have been caused by this either, they are probably just because it is an area that sees flooding a lot."
11,"From the couple posts I saw, they were definitely looking for the biblical flood and ark around the middle east"
12,There’s also the filling of the Black Sea following the end of the last ice age. One of the meltwater pulses (approximately 8000 years ago) during the early Holocene sea level rise could easily be a source of the great flood legends.
