1,Not only that but the mother is wearing short sleeves! So haram üôÑ
2,The painting is so dumb but also so UGLY
3,"In other words, just another cherry picker fruitcake"
4,Not surprising that the American right wing would love that.
5,I would have thought more would have been made of Donald Duck not wearing pants. I always thought that would get him in trouble one day.
6,Art school you say? I‚Äôd probably make her cry with my critique. I mean the subject matter aside. The skills are meh at best.
7,"Besides the homophobia, this looks like shit lmao"
8,"For someone graduating art school, her shading on that shield is atrocious , not to mention her composition is frankly trash"
9,"She's going to put down her fellow human beings who just happened to be born that way while forgetting what Mohammad had to say about drawing living beings:

**Hadith:**

Narrated \`Aisha:

The Prophet (Ô∑∫) entered upon me while there was a curtain having pictures (of animals) in the house. His face got red with anger, and then he got hold of the curtain and tore it into pieces. **The Prophet (Ô∑∫) said, ""Such people as paint these pictures will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection .**""

Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 6109  
[https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6109](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6109)  
\--------------------  
Mohammad really blew his gasket over some innocuous curtain. Severest punishment over something so trivial! [Click here to read a Koran verse about punishment in hell.](https://quran.com/an-nisa/56?translations=131) Hitler must be so relieved he didn't get accepted at [Art School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler). If he had gone down that path he would have received the **severest punishment from Allah**. Apparently, he's in a better position having committed a genocide. Talk about a lucky career break for Hitler. [Mohammad hated the jews](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2922) anyway for choosing death over accepting him as a prophet. Sigh."
10,Where were you when buzz lightyear blasted innocent school children with the gay ray? I was in Texas at Uvalde Elementary School being shot by straight bullets just as the Lord intended üôèüòáü§≤üõê
11,"I really doubt she's graduating art school, her painting lacks... Everything..."
12,I can see the woman‚Äôs arms. Astagifooollah
13,And why is Buzz looking sad? And why are the family white American looking people?
14,"As someone who's taking an arts major in a University, I can never imagine myself creating something that's filled with pure hatred.

Can imagine what was she thinking when she made this?

Also what a way to traumatize kids with such a horrific drawing."
15,"Yes, drawing ""suret"" which means face, or form of a living being, especially humans is haram in Islam. I just want to ignore the fact that one of my middle school friends (we are still in same high school) just drop out of her dreams on being a artist because of this 1400 years old arabian bullshit. I hate living in a Muslim majority country and having Muslim friends."
16,No way this person is graduating art school with this quality
17,This is...  disgusting
18,I have bad news for this art student about a large segment of the art community.

25,Is haram haram?
26,"My family watched Lightyear for family movie night last night. I thought it taught valuable lessons about stubbornness, the value of teamwork, making the best of your situation, and relativistic time dilation. It was also really funny, and both the kids were in stitches every time the cat did something funny."
27,"this isnt really good like the fabric folds are at best nonsensical, composition is reaaaly confusing, the colors make literally no sense.  also like seemingly no sense of perspective just placing things willy nilly around the poster. i have no goddamn clue how she managed to ""graduate art school"" unless this is supposed to look ugly"
28,hope she didn‚Äôt graduate
29,"Some people are saying her art sucks in technique. My critique is more with her message.

30,The artwork is Hilarious in it‚Äôs absurdity I might buy ironically
31,I would have straight up failed art uni if I brought this in front of my professors
32,"Good ole gay icon, Buzz Lightyear"
33,There were protests from the more heavily Muslim areas near me outside the cinemas for the buzz film. I watched it to see what the fuck they were so angry about and nearly missed the bit that was offensive to them. Lunatics.
34,"She needs her money back, her composition and technique are awful. I‚Äôve seen high school stuff with worse messages executed better than this."
35,They didn't blur the lady with the shield...
36,"She reminds me of another Austrian art student, I actually think he was the better artist of the two."

38,She has so much talent. I wish she‚Äôd use her powers for good instead of evil.
39,This painting is so on the nose that I have a nose bleed.
40,"The artwork itself is actually kind of cool, the thing that annoys me is there is good reason to dislike Disney. Such as it‚Äôs monopolization of the media sphere, it‚Äôs legitimately shit movies and subtitle propitiating of the illegitimate power structures and equating success and will."
41,Why is Donald holding a coconut?
42,i want a cool gay laser shooting shield too!
43,Ruined my Buzz
44,"First of all drawing living beings is haram, then why did she even do that? Oh! Wait, she thinks that people are just lying because her religion is not that stupid."
45,cringe...
46,"This is not religious r/lostredditors

Stop assuming everything islamic people do is religious"
47,I'd like this as a large print in my sitting room
48,Ngl that is an accurate Micky mouse
49,"Doing propaganda for the straight white family but your brown, lol. Ok."
50,"And her feet and chest are showing!

How did I ever convince myself that hijab was feminist? What a crock of shit"

53,Right wing religious lunatics are not known for fine arts
54,"But the radical right doesn‚Äôt like Muslims even though conservative Muslims are very aligned in terms of values ü§£

They don‚Äôt like each other despite having the same exact values"
55,"Have heard somewhere that before 9/11, American conservatives Muslim overwhelmingly vote for right wing party. But after that they are more leaning to democrat not because they change their mind to be more progressive but because the bigotry toward Muslims from the right."
56,Donald Duck is walking around showing off his Donald Dick
57,Agreed. I saw better in my highschool painting course
58,"Along with that, might I add, they‚Äôre portraying Disney Characters to be demonic"
59,"Lol ikr. I can already point out the mistakes here.

1. Buzz's headwear is blue instead of purple
2. Donald's sailor shirt is completely inaccurate
3. Mickey's shoes are white instead of yelllow.

I can already tell that she never watched cartoons during her childhood."
60,welp guess she's about to receive the severest punishment yooo
61,"The Prophet really was a crazy effen a-hole. Then again, the Old Testament and News Testament are filled with nutters who Yahweh/God/Allah just loves. Maybe it‚Äôs just that Biblical God is an ahole."
62,"I was in California in middle school being shot by a 5.45 caliber

Those desks lasted much longer than i would‚Äôve expected"
63,I was having gay Satanic transgender sex. Praise be! üôåüôåüôå

Also goes for other middle easterners

Race can be pretty ambiguous"
65,He actually looks like some shit you find in an old Frankenstein movie.
66,"As someone who has a literal Bachelor‚Äôs degree in art, this girl would have failed her painting class if she was at my school"

68,"What are the rules on photos ? 

That's different I assume , somehow ?"

70,"You should look into some Egyptian archeologists.

Egypt isnt exactly at their cultural zenith right now."
71,Two harams make a halal. That‚Äôs basic math like how two negatives make a positive
72,Only if there‚Äôs bacon on it
73,"Lightyear is easily the funniest Pixar movie in years, I can‚Äôt remember laughing at a movie so hard that wasn‚Äôt a 70s or 80s comedy"
74,"No, fine for amateurs is not fine for a supposed art graduate. It sucks in technique for someone supposedly trained."
75,No straight man has the name Buzz
76,There was a gay kiss scene in the new movie he had
77,Islam is anti LGBT as my masjid teacher has shown me through verses in the Quran with the story of Lut (pronounced as Lot in English)
78,Is there any reason to be anti lgbt other than religious?
79,It is absolutely rooted in religion.
80,"In case you didn't know, she drew this based on a [cartoon that was made a while ago ](https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/vjk34g/they_are_trying_to_turn_my_kids_gay_by_having_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"
81,but it literally is...
82,"It‚Äôs very reasonable that this is religious. The views she‚Äôs currently sharing coincide with her religion, one of which she clearly supports because of the hijab."
83,Homophobia is pretty often religious in nature
84,?
85,*Number Six : You have an amazing capacity for self-deception. How do you do that?*
86,We all have our moments. There are at least 200 separate occasions in my life where I believed at least one braindead thing for whatever reason.
87,It‚Äôs literally so women are respected and there is no possibility of someone lusting for them by looks alone.
88,[deleted]
89,"As a *very* untrained artistic eye, what is wrong with it?"
90,Which is why Donald Trump and the Saudi King hang out.
91,Just rebrand the painting as Disney's Gay Agenda or some shit and hide the artist. 100% would end up on grandma's Facebook page by the end of the night.
92,"Yeah, but he's got a shield that blocks the gay rays that will turn their kid gay.  American conservatives would really love a shield like that.  

It's just so dumb."

95,The anatomy as well. Look at the mother‚Äôs arms
96,The fact that she picked Buzz Lightyear of all characters to shoot the Gay Laser is the funniest thing ever
97,"It all made sense in context. The context being, he didn't want competition from traditional indigenous Arab religious practices, which often used statues/carvings as focuses of religious rites. If you just ban all representations of living things, no-one can try to pretend that their statue of a small god is just art to keep it. 

Likewise, why Islam uses the crescent moon, the symbol of Hubal, the local god of Mecca."
98,[deleted]
99,"Some Egyptians yes, many aren't white at all. They either look Arabic or eastern African"
100,Fr. This is some shit you find at high school or less.
