3,Where was this screenshot taken
4,"What is ""devil horn stuff""?"
5,"On the other hand I was married to an attention-seeking slut who cheated on me with many men and hardly ever wore underwear (she hadn't been like this in school or I was too naive to see the red flags) so I do get the idea of wanting some level of modesty but it's possible to fall somewhere in the middle without being a religious fruitcake.  Even now in middle age she still often dresses in a way that does not suit her at all either in attractiveness or as a wife and mother.

She's technically a right-leaning Christian and her father was a pastor - but she doesn't go to church anymore

Edit: Fine - I admit my opinion of her is colored by how thoroughly trashy she is in ways unrelated to her clothing"
6,"Dream girl:

- atheist

- liberal

- Tom boy that games with me

- wears whatever she wants

- raises the middle finger when we take selfies

- wears devil horns in bed

- has high enough standards to leave me if Iâ€™m a jerk

Dang, I need to buy my partner some devil horns and then sheâ€™ll be perfect!"

10,"Um so what ur tryna say is, if she had worn pan-ies she wouldn't have cheated on u? Don't get me wrong but people can be covered head-to-toe and still might end up cheating It hardly has anything to do with the clothing they wear.Thus making the point u made flawed.

I personally believe that people should dress what they're comfortable in even if they don't look appealing or attractive to others : U don't dress for others but for urself.

>Even now in middle age she still often dresses in a way that does not suit her at all either in attractiveness or as a wife and mother.

I don't know what ur tryna imply by this but there's no age for clothing or specific clothing u have to wear when u become a parent/wife or any other role, it's just regular everyday clothing.LMK if I've mentioned anything incorrectly."
11,Are you sure you're not my fiance? Lol jk.
12,"She would sit out on the couch with loose short skirts with her punanner out and visible - it was just a bit off-putting on a Monday afternoon with a 3-yo running around.  She would later get pregnant by her new neighbor within a few weeks of her moving out but sure I suppose one has nothing to do with the other.

Yes one can wear what they want but I feel that one starts to lose class when they seem to have no self awareness of how silly they look vs. the look that it seems they're trying to achieve with their clothing.  It sure as shit doesn't LOOK physically comfortable, not does it strike me as ""regular everyday clothing"" anyway.

Downvote me all you want - a lot of people think she's trash and it wouldn't be half as bad if she wasn't always dressed like she was looking for attention. Or if her other daughters weren't dirty with badly fitting clothing (too small because they're old clothes) at family events while her own nails are perfect."
