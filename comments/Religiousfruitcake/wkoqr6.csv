1,"Translation (not by me)


Translation in English for those who aren't that good in Malay (aka me). Note that some parts aren't direct/perfectly accurate translations, mostly because translating is hard:

LGBT Development:

LGBT crisis is increasingly receiving the attention of the world's community. The group's abnormal behaviour is not only clearly wrong by Islam and other religions but is also against humanity itself.

This group also consistently uses issues of human rights as their main shield. Those who are against the group are called ""homophobic"". Countries which ban same-sex intercourse are seen as outdated and abuses human rights.

The group is also strong in the money aspect. They sponsor many lobbyists and human rights activists in order to support their lost cause.

If left undisturbed and without intervention, it is not impossible that Malaysia would one day legalize the LGBT community. With the group growing and their supportive political members increasing, one day Malaysia may become like the many states in the US that pass same-sex marriage laws.

Step-By-Step Solutions

Create mechanisms and systematic plans in fixing this group. Counseling, psychology and medicine must be given freely to those involved in this crisis and wish to return to the straightened path.

Groups of scientists, sociologists and religious people must sit down together to find the best methods for overcoming this anti-humanitarian behavior.

Preparing strategies and places of healing specifically for this group. Those who will handle the recovery process must also have great discipline and secret-keeping as to avoid this group from distancing themselves due to shame.

Establish a NGO specifically in guiding them and are given sufficient funding. Rehabilitation concepts e.g. ""Rumah Pengasih"" made for former drug addicts can also be held for this group."
2,Not surprising. Where is the translation?
3,">melanggar hak asasi manusia

""Proceeds to berate LGBTQ people as sex deprived subhumans""

Also it's totally not a religiously biased research there. As you can see, there's literally no mentions of religion or god in any way."
4,Whereâ€™s the translation
5,"Muslim propaganda in a Muslim shithole, shocking! Malaysia would nearly be a paradise without Islam. So sad that middle eastern barbarism spread so far east."
6,"It's ironic for a country that sees a certain group of people as subhumans complaining about being seen as outdated.

Also here are the answers to the solutions:

>Create mechanisms and systematic plans in fixing this group. Counseling, psychology and medicine must be given freely to those involved in this crisis and wish to return to the straightened path.


This group doesn't need any ""fixing"". No medicine can ""cure""  homosexuality. Counseling and psychology are already provided to LGBTQ people to actually help them accept themselves and live a healthy life. 

>Groups of scientists, sociologists and religious people must sit down together to find the best methods for overcoming this anti-humanitarian behavior.

No, absolutely not. There should be ONLY groups of scientists and sociologists that should handle this ""issue"". Pretty hypocritical to call being LGBTQ as an anti-humanitarian behavior when these people are already doing that in the name of religion.

>Preparing strategies and places of healing specifically for this group. Those who will handle the recovery process must also have great discipline and secret-keeping as to avoid this group from distancing themselves due to shame.

You mean conversion therapies? ok, and how well did that work out? Torturing someone into making them believe what they're not is not healing. 

>Establish a NGO specifically in guiding them and are given sufficient funding. Rehabilitation concepts e.g. ""Rumah Pengasih"" made for former drug addicts can also be held for this group

Ah yes, being gay is equal to being a drug addict bc they're hypersexual and will rape anyone they see in front of them. 

They're so deluded to think they're so perfect when they're literally 50 years behind most countries, including their neighboring country, Singapore"
7,Literally just posted lol. Apologies for the delay.
8,"It's Malaysia. They are a borderline theocracy even though only around 60% of the population is Muslim, and the elective monarchy doesn't seem to be the reason."
9,philipine and thailand are whore paradises
10,Your comment isnt showing for some reason.
11,We still can't see it?
12,Reposted. Let me know if it works. Sorry for that and thanks
13,"Hmm. Its still not showing. Looking at your comment history i can see the comments, but its not showing up in this post. It might be because it contains a mentioned user or something thinking its spam.

Edit: i think you need to contact the mods to ask why.

Edit 2: yeah its definitely getting filtered and automatically removed because it contains links and mentions users. So the automod prob thinks your brigading or something."
