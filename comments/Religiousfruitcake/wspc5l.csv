1,"Yeah, what were you thinking? Wearing that could easily turn her gay."
2,Didn't sky daddy make the damned rainbow? And then skittles?
3,"When you ""morally justified"" by your religion,to find a means to be knowingly and deliberately rude to someone who was trying to do something nice for you. True fruitcakery"
4,"What a horrible coworker. A handcrafted gift that's of good quality returned just because of bigotry, fuck them."
5,"I'm sorry but just fuck this bitch, twice, wicth a sandpaper dildo."
6,kids love rainbows.. obviously all kids are gay and there's just no other explanation for that.... but for real this blanket is amazing and you should still be proud
7,"Beautiful crochet job, horrible woman (the recipient of the gift to be clear)."
8,I bet this woman screams at the sky when a rainbow appears
9,That doesnt even look anything like the pride flag what so ever
10,Imagine being such a terrible person that instead of your first thought being oh what a lovely gift your response is basically saying I don't like gay people  and screw you for doing something nice.  May this lady find rocks in her shoes and legos under her bare feet for being such an unkind human.  Just enough to make her every waking moment mildy inconvenient and occasionally painful.
11,"That is a beautiful piece of workmanship, I like the texture and the colors.  Your coworker sounds like a very narrow minded person and I feel sorry for her daughter who will be raised in that environment.  The rainbow predates its usage by the LGTBQ community by something like 4 billion years and the reason the rainbow was chosen by that community was because it has all colors so denotes inclusivity for ALL people, not just gay, bi, or trans people.  I am a firm believer that people are people, and unless they intend harm let them live their lives."
12,Iâ€™d be stoked to get something that awesome! It looks amazing! I adore all the colours!
13,"this is really good crochet man, that coworker is missing out! :["
14,But its so pretty
15,It's always so funny that a single rainbow can shatters decades of education.

17,I did.
18,"Yea ask her why she has a roblem with gods rainbow, if she is some kind of devil worshipper ?  Then quote the rainbow passage in the bible at her and see her squirm.  If she then claims to accept it you tell her nah you are not giving your hard work to devil worshippers l"
19,I would love to accept this gift- and thank the person sincerely.
20,I would say with a pineapple. . . Leafy side first
