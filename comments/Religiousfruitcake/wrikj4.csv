1,"I mean, they're right about god not making that plant...just not in the way they think."
2,"So the, in the Christian worldview, literal designer and creator of the actual prototypical penis (""in his own image"" nonetheless) wouldn't also make a penis shaped plant?"
3,Wait till they find out that thing is actually hollow and the glan is actually a cover.
4,Maybe God made our joysticks in the shape of a plant? ü§îüòÅ
5,"Taking one for the team and googling ‚Äúphillac shaped plant.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a Nepenthes Holdenii, a tropical Pitcher Plant native to Southeast Asia."
6,So god would put actual dicks on actual humans allegedly made in its own image but a penis on a plant is too much?
7,Is that Victreebel?!
8,r/unintentionallydirty plants be driving furitcakes wild
9,Love how they say God is above them but are so quick to say what God would or wouldn‚Äôt do like they know
10,What I find most amusing is that the image is blurred out as nsfw. Even though it's only a flower. Almost makes the OPs point for them.
11,"Is it a pitcher plant photographed from an unflattering angle?

Also, there's a Ray Comfort joke hiding in this, but I'm not clever enough to tease it out..."
12,People might start worshipping it
13,_Coming next in the GOP platform_
14,Wait until they find out about the [innkeeper worm](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50779461).  Or the [Atretochoana eiselti](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-penis-snake-a-real-animal/).

18,"Sometimes, I wonder what the fuck these creationists smoke?"
19,"""God"" made animals that shit out of their mouth. You know... ""intelligent design."""
20,It must be a sad life to be shocked by penises.  She (he?) must still feel guilty for that one time she/he had an orgasm.
21,"""God"" looking and laughing at this person"
22,"My problem isn't that some people think like this. 

My problem is when people who think like this vote."
23,I see this and raise you dead man‚Äôs dick mushrooms.
24,Oh no. Not teens. How could we expose people in the horniest part of their lives to such a travesty of nature
25,"Lol, these grow like a mile away from where I live."
26,The new cucumber?
27,Waitz so God would make a penis but not a penis shaped plant?
28,"I mean, half the population on the planet was given one of those from ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt have a problem with them."
29,Great. Now they'll make a conspiracy saying how it was genetically engineered by the satanic government or some shit
30,Now he gets to be a lawyer? What a sick joke.. something something magna carta
31,Pacific geoduck has entered the chat
32,"""I'm religious so I can determine what God would or wouldn't do"" - like mate, get a couple of hours of biology - or any science for what matters - under your fucking wing and then come back to tattle about God. 

We've been living in a world defined and developped by those who don't want to know about it."
33,"Well, grow the fuck up and explain what it is to children (appropriately). 

I know, crazy talk!"
34,Perhaps he made the penis in the shape of a plant ? ü§î
35,So why god did made my penis penis shaped ? Checkmate !
36,What a sick joke! And he gets to be a lawyer??
37,"God made penises that look like penises and he's lazy, so I would not be surprised if he just re-skinned the same design."
38,God made a penis first.
39,What are these plants and where can I buy one?
40,I would love to send the links for meatspin and tubgirl to this person. Also lemon party.

42,Its a Nepenthes Holdenii.
43,This is evidence that christianity causes Anencephaly
44,Little kids and teenagers have to see this?
45,"Reminds me of my time working in a Pharmacy. Hearing a mother tell the pharmacist that her daughter got sick swallowing the suppositories for nausea. when asked if she read the instructions she insisted the pharmacist wrote them wrong because no medication goes ""There""."
46,Conclusion: pay attention on biology classes.
47,"Apparently the plant has become endangered because people keep handling them

48,"Projection can hurt maam, they have little kids and teenagers that read your comment"
49,"Try doing a Google image search for Nepenthes. Amazingly beautiful plant that at time also appears to have a beautiful phallic shape before opening up. So like all nice things in the world, it was created by Satan?"
50,Looks like a pitcher plant
51,# In his own image.
52,"I'm an atheist, but this is making me doubt myself. After all, if I were God, this is exactly what I would create."

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoduck"
57,"So .. I'm a plant hoarder and one of my true loves is a fine collection of carnivorous plants. This is a Nepenthes/ pitcher plant. And here in FL, the tree frogs LOVE to get inside each ""penis"" as they are opportunists and stuff themselves with bugs making their way in. It's a win- win for everyone. And if this person really wants to faint, wait till he finds out about the thousands of orchids that are literally the shape of vulvasüòÇüòÇ"
58,wait till they find out about the toilet plant (that is also a pitcher plant similar to this one)
59,Banned from the internet
60,I'm literally shaking and crying God would never make a plant like this please tell me this is fake
61,Yo God literally made a human body part that was shaped like a penis why would he stop at plants?
62,"Yeah, it‚Äôs only okay for kids and young teenagers to see penis when it‚Äôs a priest. Delete this immediately"
63,"It's amazing that this person is questioning the existence of pitcher plants, and not the particular god they worship."
64,I just see a plant. Not a pervert who is imagining everything is a penis.
65,Right! God wouldn't even make a penis in the shape of a penis.
66,"Wait, NSFW tag? Is this plant seriously considered NSFW? Like... it's actually just a plant..."
67,"Ah yes, the entity who according to them designed the penis would not create a plant in its likeness."
68,It‚Äôs the forbidden flower
69,reads like a trump tweet
70,"I am not crazy! I am not crazy! I know they swapped those plants! One after the dick pic plant, as if God could ever make a mistake, never, never! They covered their tracks, they got that idiot who wrote the Bible to lie for them‚Ä¶ you think this is bad? This chicanery? The Divine Comedy! Christian theology just happens to change like that? No! They orchestrated it! The internet people!"
71,"People like this are the reason people still have no idea about the Polar Cap expeditions...

(The ones I mean were funded by the Catholic church and were focused on study and observation of animal life, for anyone wandering)"
72,Isn't that just a dude with a boner lying under a bunch of plants?
73,if that flower fruits i‚Äôm gonna make a cake out of it.
74,Oh yes She would!
75,Some little kids and teenagers also have a penis. Have them never look down?
76,"Oh no, a teenager might see... *gasp* something that resembles a penis? *faints*"
77,"There is so much to unpack here.

This person's first impulse was to equate this to a penis? What's a mushroom to this person then? Just because something is vaguely phallic doesn't mean it's a dick. Look at rockets with big fairings, for instance ‚Äî everything serves a purpose.

And what's so evil about a penis? If humans were created by a god, that god created penises too.

And why does a god have to be brought into this at all in the first place? Okay, the dumbass is a creationist, which is its own can of worms, but they can't just appreciate nature without having to impose human judgement on it?

What is going on inside their head?"
78,Penises were made by the antichrist confirmed. Sorry men you're all going to hell
79,"Have they not seen most of mushrooms?
We even have some called Penis Envy, and yeah totally look like dicks too!"

81,"Isn't it the carnivorous plant,  darlingtonia?  We had one that looked similar."
82,They forgot their usual spiel that the devil made it
83,"That's a plant I learned in my 8th standard , so ig mate never made it school"
84,"While you're nice and upset, have a word to your priest/pastor/clergyman and ask him not to show his real penis to kids and teenagers."
85,"Fun fact: god made penises in the shape of penises!

Or, he simply doesn't exist, but some brains have massive pareidolie because of their ""users"" fixation on sex..."
86,"Hugo Chavez, JFK jr , The Frankfurt School and Joseph Robinette Biden created that Cambodian plant to spread immorality and steal the election from God, I mean Trump!"
87,Wait until they see the peanut worm
88,Maybe he ran out of shapes
89,What no biology does to a MF.
90,"god could never make something as cool as nepenthes, must be satans work!"
91,"I work with a guy that I refer to as ‚Äúthe god guy‚Äù because no matter what conversation we are having he brings it back to his religion. It could be pro-wrestling, the Hubble telescope, volcanos in Indonesia, baseball, etc. it doesn‚Äôt matter. Drives me up a wall."
92,"By thier own words God literally made penises to begin with, so what's the problem?"
93,I mean idk a lot of house animals like dogs  walk around with their penis hangin' and no one complains so I don't see the diff.
94,"God allegedly handcrafted Adam in his own image, so that means he totally touched Adam's dick and balls. He must have done some delicate work with his fingers to shape his asshole."
95,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. God made something similar to put on that dude‚Äôs/lady‚Äôs father‚Ä¶ god can‚Äôt put one on a plant too if he feels like it? üòÇ
96,And surely he sees nothing wrong with penises or he would‚Äôve made pants for horses
97,"I think if you told this to her, her head would combust"
98,Idk what kind of xbox 360 you got but mine are normal
99,I did some hiking in Northern Malaysia a few years back and these babies are scattered throughout the highland mountain forests. Super cool to see.
100,"When i was a young aspiring artist we used to have the 'visual language' course where we learned about analysis and how to 'read' art. On the subject of phallic references, our teachers told us about Freud and psychanalisis at the begining of first semester, then by the end of the year they told us how that was all gobshite and most of the analyses provided are a product of our own bias. They made us cringe by making us read some of our old expos√©s. 

By second semester we learned to smile and nod at the freshmen obsession with penis in old paintings."
