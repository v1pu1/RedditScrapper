1,Pretty sure God's seen them titties before.
2,"Matthew 5:29  
If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

They always seem to ignore that verse and instead tell women to cover up."
3,Wear Abra. So you can teleport away if some starts throwing bullshit at you.
4,If your man is looking at other womens boobs/nipples HE is the one “disrespecting” your marriage. Let women live. We don’t make men wear jock straps under their grey sweats lol
5,FREE THE NIPPLE!!!!!
6,It would be cool if the Puritans of this country all hopped on a boat and sought out a new land.
7,"Aw yes, projecting insecurities 101"
8,"Wow.  It's not just the Muslim posters who think men go crazy at the sight of a woman's blank (insert anything here from a tiny bump, to an ankle, to an elbow).  Maybe your man is a dog, lady, but that doesn't mean they all are!"
9,Damn tho some guys walk out there with bigger titties than me.
10,"Remember young ladies, you're the property of some guy you've probably haven't met yet."

But he's totally cool with slavery though . . ."
12,EYES UP HERE JESUS
13,QUIT MAKING ME STARE AT YOUR LUCIOUS TITS!!!!
14,is this a taliban profile?
15,"Yeah, I don't think my marriage is so weak that my husband seeing another woman's nipples will automatically ruin it, so I don't see where the disrespect is."
16,Why do some people think they can decide how other people should behave?
17,Oh look…it’s my daughters’ father…
18,I'd love to order a tshirt and jeans with multiple custom nipple prints everywhere and parade in front of that stupid woman while cackling like a witch.
19,"They're already covering their nipples, it's called clothes.

If you're offending yourself by staring at other people's chests that's a you problem"
20,"""you belong to a man you haven't even met yet. Keep your gift wrap on for when you're presented to your owner so you'll be fresh and new for him."""
21,At least wear a burka.
22,"I like women and I have a super high libido, yet somehow, other people's nipples have had no negative impact on me whatsoever. I'm just like ""nice"" and then move on. I don't even need to pray to Jesus for strength!"
23,">You are disrespecting god

>Who I also believe made these titties but damn if they ain’t shameful 

Also, good, fuck him"
24,"No 😊. As I tell all my friends, you wanna go out during what’s normally bra off time, I’ll come, but I will not be wearing a bra."
25,"1) Other people's relationships are neither my business nor my problem.


2) My relationships are not your business.


3) My Gods include Aphrodite, Dionysus, and Zeus. They don't care."
26,Wow. Disgusting. Where?
27,Make me stumble. I want it
28,"Aaaaahh yes, the lesser known 11th commandment: Thou shalt not disrespect your future husband.... by fully covering your nipples with cloth but not padding it enough so other humans with nipples are capable of seeing the shading on said cloth"
29,Wear whatever makes you feel good ladies (and gentlemen) who the has time to care
30,"Church going puritans, misogynists, fearers of the foof

Stop👏fucking👏looking👏"
31,"Nipple tassels for modesty, ladies. Keep those disrespectful nips covered!"
32,"I never realized my nipples had such potent powers of disrespect. They're projecting through my shirt all the way to heaven.

> You are disrespecting other people's marriages/spouses.

Didn't Jesus have something to say about this? Something about plucking out your eye if it causes you to sin?"
33,"I am guessing you have an agenda for stopping this.

r/usernamechecksout"
34,"Why do nutcases always think any of us give a fuck about ""disrespecting god""?"
35,"""Wtf bro chill I don't care""

- God, probably"
36,Yeah! Boobs are a well-known trip hazard and should come with a warning label. /s
37,I like how she put respect for yourself last… as if a women is everyone else’s property.
38,"This is Christian Sharia law - don't cause others to stumble, it is your fault people are perverts or don't have self control."
39,Sorry I have a rule to never listen to anyone who uses 👏 the 👏 clapping 👏 emoji 👏 like 👏 this 👏 because 👏 it’s 👏 obnoxious 👏 and 👏 patronising 👏 as 👏 fuck 👏 you 👏 just 👏 look 👏 like 👏 a 👏 childish 👏 dickhead 👏👏👏👏👏👏
40,Im disrespecting god? WHO WANTS TO SEE SOME TRANS TITS?
41,It’s simple! Free the nipple!!
42,Everyone. 👏 Has. 👏 Nipples. 👏
43,"So long as she doesn’t want to ban leggings and yoga pants… 

Seriously, though - these people need to get a grip. I’m a married guy with a sex drive like most other men. Amazingly I don’t drool when I see some random woman walking by without a bra or clothes that leave nothing to the imagination. If a guy’s eye is wandering though, it doesn’t mean he wants to, or intends to try to have sex with anyone with their nipples visibly poking their shirt. I’m guessing this person has much bigger problems in their marriage, and nipples of braless women isn’t it."
44,Admitting that males are just weak and cannot control themselves.
45,My tiddies too small to notice so no 👍
46,Modesty is subjective.
47,"You’re ability to use social media is against god, the simple fact that you speak without a man’s approval is a crime, according to the lord, the “all loving lord”."
48,Cringe
49,What if she doesn't believe in a god?
50,Obviously must be the most uncomfortable padded bras to cover the nips and never be in an air conditioned environment.
51,I uhhh… think it’s fine
52,"Bro what is even the problem here, based trad women encourages women to dress with some decency and y'all think it's extremism💀💀💀"
53,God did indeed make eve without a bra
54,God loves him some titties!
55,I was about to shitpost and then my man delivered.
56,God made them with nipples. Some small. Some large. Some long. What does the person have against god’s creation?
57,Bold of you to assume any of these people have ever read it
58,And there is my problem with beliefs like sola scriptura and biblical relevancy right on display. Are they any good if one does not understand them or deliberately chooses to ignore them for one reason or another?
59,"Ehh, I'm more a fan of the Gengar line."
60,"fucking Abra, always teleporting away, little bitch /s

(red)"
61,"> We don’t make men wear jock straps under their grey sweats lol

And thank the sky fairy for that."
62,"Ah. But you don't understand. In their religion, women are the source of every ill to mankind."
63,"A married person noticing someone they find attractive and looking at boobs/nipples/other body parts they’re into ≠ disrespecting their marriage. Going outside of the mutually agreed on boundaries of your marriage, lying to or disrespecting your spouse, and favoring your wants/needs over your spouse’s wants/needs = disrespecting your marriage.  Marriage is whatever a couple makes of it and successful marriages differ tremendously in terms of boundaries and relationship dynamics.  The only absolute requirements are honesty, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to the relationship and each other."
64,America 2
65,"The Brits tried this in the 17th century, and look at where we are now."

69,Don’t forget genocide. He loves genocide.
70,"This cuts both ways, though. All ways, really. Progressives can get kind of preachy, too. Some people can only feel good about themselves by finding someone who is “wrong”."
71,Fr. These people project their lack of self control so hard towards others.
72,"Tits out for Aphrodite!

Also not sure if you're aware, we have a sub for Dionysus over at r/Dionysus if you have any interest!"
73,She has no business imposing her beliefs on others.
74,Yea the truth is degeneracy really does lower society to the common denominator. This is just another step in that direction. Trad women are against the odds these days.
75,both of you can have my angry upvote
76,Absolutely!!!! I’m personally a fan of commando with those grey sweats!
77,Absolutely agree! That’s why I put disrespecting in quotes
78,Yeah both sides are wrong 😒

80,"Um, yeah.  I’m the one in this exchange who is unintelligent. Ya got me.  I’m cryin’ 🙄"
