1,Ok but wtf did Burger King do?
2,"Many atheists are gay, and trans, and everything under the sun except for theists. Why should that be an insult, and how cultures are you when you think someone’s sexuality is worthy of insult?"
3,Catholics are just better at hiding it. And when caught it’s all done in the name of the lord.
4,And they wonder why so many queer people are either atheists or hate religion
5,"*Shrug* I guess being the stereotypical queer theatre/music kid isn't cultured enough for them.

Boomer that made this also seems to not be a fan of literature. Shakespeare was bi lol."
6,I love how it's forgotten how awful Peta is
7,Catholics are the ones assaulting children.
8,This seems like a Latino fighting back against things he views as “American”. It makes me sad as a queer Hispanic to see how unwelcome I am by my own culture
9,"I literally have no idea what this is trying to say, except that the author doesn't know anything about peta"
10,"As a latino atheist, uuuumm, wut?

Also, this is hillariously and ironically pro inmigrant if you wanna look at it that way"
11,"""Violent and irrational"" is essentially human behavior in a nutshell."
12,We usually are happier. None of that nasty cognitive dissonance
13,"Something like only 15% of Spanish (as in, Spain) people are practicing catholics."
14,Catholics are frogs.
15,A few thousand altar boys would like to have a word about that.
16,"It's kinda ironic that they used the Amerimutt caricature for the American. The Amerimutt caricature was created to demonize racial mixing, a thing that was never taboo in Latin America."
17,"NHLCL.

We should just use the abbreviation now."
18,Imagine being such a lose you use Pepe to represent you lol
19,"This was probably made by some edgy 15 year-old ""Tradcath"" who recently bought an 80-dollar crusader-helmet and costume on amazon, shortly after realizing if he tones down his ""red-pilled"" nazi-rhetoric a little bit and substitutes God for Hitler, he can get away with basically 90% of his stupid opinions.

Truely doing the Lord's work shitposting and slandering in the name of Jaysus with played out 4chan memes, Jesus must be very proud."
20,"Woah, why are they throwing Burger King into this??"
21,Only things on this I agree with is fuck Peta and Burger King isn't that good
22,What kind of fucknuts think atheist supporting PETA?!
23,"Forgot to mention that Atheists are also obese too, apparently."
24,He's just telling us he like McDonald's more than Burger King without telling us he like McDonald's more than Burger King.
25,Conservatives get it into their head that Atheists only eat low quality fast food. Because apparently you need scrape before a cross before you can cook anything more complex than a microwave meal.
26,"That’s true, but the person that made this meme thinks that countries that offer freedom of religion (the US in this case) will end up being “degenerate” or whatever. Basically, this meme is saying that religious, Catholic countries have more culture and dignity than countries that allow separation of church and state."
27,">	Catholics are just better at hiding it.

Certainly the priests are."
28,">Shakespeare

If I remember right, the guy that made this hates everything Anglo. Shakespeare would be at the top of his “books to burn” list."
29,"They're not, really. It's a meme."
30,"Que querés que te diga, así son los católicos, aman el odio y la violencia pero gritaran ""COLISEOS"" a los cuatro vientos si te atreves a decir que merecen lo mismo que piden a todos los demás."
31,Oh too bad I was hoping for more of a Christ is the true burger King of kings angle.
32,Right?  Because we never see obese Christians -- especially in the South! /s
33,I mean “bread and wine” is probably more “cultured” indeed
34,"Also, plenty of catholic majority countries also have laws that protect freedom of religion.

Freedom of religion is defended by law in many latin american countries. Also, bitch, Ireland!!"
35,Freedom of speech my ass.
36,"Yeah, they never killed 80% of the animals they shelter every year (in average) and never kidnaped pets either. For example, it's definitively not because they killed a 9-year-old girl's pet chihuahua that they paid nearly $50k to the kid's family in 2017. That's totally unrelated.

37,"Me parece gracioso que pusieran a España como uno de los países católicos superiores, cuando fuimos el primer país en legalizar el matrimonio homosexual jajja."
38,"Además de boludos está gente son puros LARPERS.

(Translatation: Not only are they stupid but also true LARPERS)."
39,">they never killed 80% of the animals they shelter every year (in average)

Of course they do. [They're not a no-kill shelter](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/fact-check-peta-responsible-deaths-thousands-animals-1565532%3famp=1). No-kill shelters cherry-pick animals to only allow in the most adoptable, which is a policy that doesn't help and often leads to people dumping animals, or neglecting them in other ways. Peta's shelter offers free euthanasia services for guardians who can't afford to have their sick and dying companion animals put to sleep. This allows other shelters to keep their hands clean. And this is only an issue because of the huge number of people who buy animals from breeders instead of adopting. 

As for the kidnapping of a chihuahua, you'll notice that that was an isolated case and not PETA's policy. You're welcome to visit their website and read their article titled ""Why we kidnap chihuahuas,"" if you can find it. But you won't, because it doesn't exist, because kidnapping chihuahuas doesn't advance the cause of animal liberation. 

The bottom line is that you can disagree with PETA's methods, but any indictment of their euthanasia record is laughable coming from anyone who consumes animal products. Dunking on PETA is a convenient way to divert attention from your own actions and avoid thinking about the countless animals you cause to suffer on a daily basis if you're not vegan. Even if PETA made shepherd's pie out of all the cats and dogs they take in, it wouldn't make animal exploitation on your part any more acceptable."
40,"Ya, pero piensa que si esta gente, como creo yo, son hispanicos ellos mismos entonces son de aquellos reaccionarios que velan por retornar a la época del imperio Habsburgo (lo digo porque esto no sería nada raro dentro de los ""Hispanistas"" de Facebook y Twitter)."
41,"Claro que lo son, pero es divertido ver cómo hay gringos que intentan hacer memes de latinos sin saber nada de Latinoamérica. Como si no hubiesen ya 3 países aquí donde el aborto y matrimonio gay son legales."
42,"So, you're saying the virginian department of agriculture and consumer sevices is lying in its reports? [https://petakillsanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PetaKillsAnimals.pdf](https://petakillsanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PetaKillsAnimals.pdf)

What is really laughable is YOUR attempt to divert the attention from the fact that an organization that is supposed to protect the animals is killing them instead. You don't see me criticizing those who really care about animal protection. Maybe you shouldn't spend that much time defending them when there's evidence they don't deserve your support..."
43,"No no, yo creo que estos son católicos de acá, esos hispanistas ultra católicos de Twitter, ya sabes, esa gente."
