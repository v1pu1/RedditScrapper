1,That person has to be a troll. Well I hope. God damn.
2,"I don't know how anyone can associate Trump with ""love and kindness"""
3,"Has she been fined or arrested for going to church?

Or does she think that god is sending angels of protection to hide it from the police?"
4,"Bruh, that's a new level of just fucking lying to yourself. These are the dumbasses who can vote?"
5,"Someone failed perception check.


Also these people reproduce and vote."
6,I can't tell if shes being sarcastic. I took it as severe sarcasm at first then I remembered how crazy some of them are.
7,"Or she's gaslighting. Either way, someone who needs to be on a list of some sort."
8,"Siri, show me Poe’s Law in effect."
9,That HAS to be a joke
10,"Biden goes to church every sunday, same church he has attending since before being in office.  That lady is crazy!"
11,It is insane that the same people that called devout Christian Obama the anti Christ are the same people saying a guy that has been a practicing Catholic longer than they've been alive is the guy to outlaw Christianity.
12,"Holy shit, I’m almost envious."
13,r/whoosh
14,99.98% of the people who participate in American politics are fucking idiots.
15,This is quite clearly satire.
16,Tell me you live in an all white neighborhood without telling me you live in an all white neighborhood
17,All this tells me is that they know nothing about Donald Trump. It’s easy to project whatever you want on a person you know nothing about
18,Classic Karen.
19,I seem to remember it being the exact opposite
20,How far does one have to stick their head up their ass to believe this unbelievableness?
21,TIL it's illegal now to believe in god in the US
22,She has to be sarcastic
23,Wow! There was not even one actual truth in her entire statement! Satire?
24,Is this sarcasm?
25,"Trump has Christian values?

They do know he cheated on his wife, right?"
26,"Holy shit, that wasn't sarcasm?"
27,It’s becoming harder and harder to not interpret MAGA Christians as Satire
28,Yeah either she's trolling herself or everybody else.
29,I thought the same - there's no way she could be serious with that. I hope.
30,Only on opposite day.
31,Christians redefine abuse to mean love and kindness
32,These people are impossible to satirize.
33,Maybe love and kindness isn't what they associate Christianity with anymore haha
34,"Or ""Christianity"" for that matter"
35,"She’s the type of religious person that thinks not being able to enforce her religious ways on others is a violation of her religious freedom. Sadly, the supreme court might agree with her.

What’s the saying? Equality to the oppressor feels like oppression? This is that."
36,"It's their persecution fetish. They think people actually being persecuted are doing it for attention. They want all the attention but none of the actual ""your lifestyle offends me so I will vote to strip away your rights"" reality."
37,They just want to be seen as persecuted because it justifies the evil things they want to do with their death cult
38,I'm positive it's sarcasm.
39,"""Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States, and of American literature."""
40,So a puritan.
41,I’m not. I know someone like this.
42,"Yup. That tracks, Siri."
