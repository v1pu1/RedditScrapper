1,"Now that he has plenty of free time, he'll be able to be one of those lunatics who yells at students full time."
2,"The truth is leave people the fuck alone, let them wear what they want, it's not harming you or anyone else so mind ya damn business and I'll mind mine"
3,"The only other question I have is ‚Äúwhat the hell is a Christian construction company?‚Äù

Do they like just build churches and that‚Äôs it? Honestly someone‚Äôs religion is not on the things I consider when choosing a builder‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
4,"This is old as fuck. IIRC his wife divorced him also because, you know, harrassing 18 y.o. girls because you feel too funny in yer pants"
5,"no, it is not the WILL of god. if it WAS the will of god there would be no need for people like you."
6,I guess he forgot that verse about plucking out your eyes if they lead you to sin.
7,"Just what we need in America, religious police."
8,"What a scam to look a half naked women with your wife standing beside you. Honey look at the tits, just hanging out on that one. I have to go over and let her know our feelings of her big beautiful breasts hanging just right making me lust for her. Ok dear have fun take your gun and 1 kid with you I‚Äôm tired."

10,I always wondered if there was a follow up to that. Glad he got what he deserved.
11,They probably only gave him the sack because exposure would get in the way of business.
12,Basically Y'all Qaeda. Why complain about middle eastern fundies when we have our homegrown scum.
13,"Religion is like a penis. You can have one, you can talk about it to people willing to listen, but don‚Äôt shove it down everyone‚Äôs throat."
14,"Yeah, that‚Äôs the problem with listening to your own thoughts and mistaking them for the will of an imaginary god."
15,"‚ÄúHe maintains that policing women's clothing is God's will.‚Äù

&#x200B;

 The good thing about a god that doesn‚Äôt exist is that they hate all the same people you do and you can just claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúgod‚Äôs will‚Äù whenever you‚Äôre an asshole."
16,"Can we ship this guy to the Taliban pls, they'll love him"
17,I'd have asked him to show me where the bible forbids clothing while allowing men to police them.
18,What's a cristian company?
19,I don‚Äôt even wear shorts in the beach so I‚Äôm gonna go and harass him next time i see him
20,I thought good Bible humpers didn‚Äôt have tattoos?
21,Isn‚Äôt there a verse that says if a man lusts after a woman he must cut out his own eyes? This guy is not following the Bible and someone must get this man some sterilised tools.
22,"The book of Dontbeadick chapter 7 verse 23 says: ‚ÄúVerily I say unto thee, thou shalt mind thy fucking business.‚Äù"
23,One person‚Äôs religious freedom ends where another person‚Äôs begins. This guy lacks respect.
24,Well.
25,Does that mean young woman are not allowed to take their children swimming.
26,r/byebyejob
27,Send this tool to SA. He will fit in better there.
28,"Fun fact: the veracity of what you're yelling is irrelevant to the claim of harassment.

If your response to accusations of harassment is, ""Well, it's true"" you've committed a non sequitur."
29,All this is even better when you watch the video and find him tucking away his boner
30,"According to the Bible, god created Adam and Eve naked. It wasn‚Äôt god that told them to cover up when they got kicked out of Eden, that was their choice. I fully believe that the god they worship does not care if we are clothed. I also believe that if at any point he said ‚Äúwelp now you have to stay completely covered in order to be chaste and godly‚Äù that was some overcompensation of an overly embarrassed narrator. God don‚Äôt give no shits about it or he would have created them with clothes to begin with."
31,"If ur own people from ur own religion have to fire u, u know u f‚Äôd up."
32,Watch the video and see what his wife is wearing.
33,"I had one of those on my campus last semester. Found out he owed the IRS something like $180,000, so I made a sign about that and handed out printouts of the public record court dates to everyone else counterprotesting or just passing by.

He hasn't shown up again."
34,Almost. He decided to rap at them instead
35,God damn kids whacking off in the tool shed again
36,Oh God I remember having one on campus when I was in college. Another student actually got into a shouting match with him lmao
37,Don't worry he'll be a featured speaker at some right wing conference.
38,"It's hurting God and he's not capable of sticking up for himself, so fantastic people like this guy need to jump in on God's behalf. Otherwise nothing will ever get done about these immoral women.

Guys are fine though, no reason to go up to dudes in swimming trunks and tell them what to wear"
39,"Well it's hurting god and because he loves god, he can't go through his beloved god being hurt so he ends up hurting innocent people so that the hurt god can heal and he won't be hurt anymore because god is now happy. 

It sounds stupid isn't it? Because it is."
40,Couldn't have said it better myself.
41,Probably a regular construction company where you get harassed if you aren't Christian
42,"There's a used car dealership here that puts jesus fish on their cars and advertises using their christianity as a selling point.

From what I've seen, 'christian' is not a selling point or an indication that they're trustworthy and honest. Quite the opposite, in fact. I'm not buying a religion, I'm buying a fucking car. And not from YOU, mister christian used car man."
43,"> Honestly someone‚Äôs religion is not on the things I consider when choosing a builder

It is for me.

If they are bragging about it, that's a disqualifying factor."
44,"I didn‚Äôt used to either, but then I moved someplace with an extreme white Christian nationalist congregation.

It‚Äôs really a weird feeling trying to figure out where someone goes to church (or doesn‚Äôt) before you do business with them. 

I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a Baptist or Catholic, Buddhist or Atheist.  If you do good work, and I trust you, I‚Äôm happy to do business with you.  But I draw the line at ‚Äúpro-slavery white Christian nationalist trying to take over our town government and implement a theocracy.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really want my $$s to support that goal."
45,Probably a regular construction company that doesn't need to pay taxes
46,Yeah if your boner rules over you that much then you're a man child who needs to shut the fuck up. Normal men can handle attractive women being around. If your religion is that hard for you to follow then I guess it sucks to suck.
47,Less than a year ago (9/6/21) but I suppose that‚Äôs relative.
48,"Crazy part is the women in the vid mentioned that to him. 

Also, when they told him to leave them alone he said he believes in ‚Äúfree will‚Äù. The irony being completely missed."
49,"Right?

Like I have said before, the Bible is not the perfect word of a god. But rather, a malleable shield for one‚Äôs predetermined beliefs."
50,"I think Jesus said it, not the Bible."
51,Looks like he attached the sack to his chin.
52,A company that will cheat you and do a bad job.
53,that's about the dankest shit i heard all weekend. wp
54,May Satan bless you üòÇ
55,"How does one go about finding that info?  Like, legally."
56,"Yes, attack him on a sensitive point, you assure!"
57,We speak your name
58,"The world is bad enough already, we don't need that."
59,"And now, a good Christo-Republican will explain to you how to behave in an odious manner towards complete strangers, under the pretext of a collection of fables written several millennia ago!"
60,"Then God should mind his own damn business, if you don't like what someone is wearing then don't look, women wearing something that's a little reveling isn't hurting anyone, and the people who comment about it shouldn't even be looking, and if you're going out of your way to tell women what they can wear then tell men too.

At the end of they day you can wear what you want, just teach your little crotch goblins not to stare."
61,"You know what I'd hate? Imagine I have an aneurysm ready to pop right now and it's gonna pop at 3:45pm no matter what. I'd hate to say ""Well, God can tell me his damn self"" at 3:44pm"
62,"I don't think its god that gives a toss. He clearly had no qualms about raping Jesus' mom when he felt like it, so I doubt he's that put off from a couple of women in bikinis. I suspect it's more his fan club that blames women for giving them impure thoughts that are more the problem. Matey should be off with a hair shirt whipping himself instead of policing the beach."
63,"It's hilarious and sad, considering the bible actually denounces policing people's lives."
64,But it is not hurting his god. That god gave people free will. That means women are free to willing wear a bikini. And this guy is free to go screw himself
65,or one with illegal hiring practices
66,"My personal experience is that advertising that your business is Christian is a good indication that they lie, cheat, and do shoddy work."
67,"Personally, I Like having attractive women around."
68,No it isn't. Unless one of you is traveling at relativistic speed.
69,Last weekend I had the misfortune of being placed next to a church group at the campground I was in. At one point I overheard a conversation about how to make scripture fit the narrative that suited how to change scripture to fit their political stance.
70,You can search Public Access to Court Information.  At least we can in Arizona
71,"Everything was public record! You have to dig sometimes, but it's available. In my case, I looked through the online courthouse records and it was all there.

It can be tricky because while yes, it's public record, it doesn't have to be made easy to find."
72,God has little raisin balls so he whines like the puny bitch he is. Puny god can't handle anything outside his comfort zone. What a snowflake.
73,"
>Then God should mind his own damn business

Apparently he's been minding his own business for a couple thousand years. If only his followers could do the same..."
74,">crotch goblins

I'm gonna steal that from you tyvm"
75,It probably denounces it 5 times and supports it 5 times
76,"Imo free will is bullshit. 

It's like giving someone a 30 sec headstart for a chance to escape while you take him down."
77,"Yup. That's about right, imo too."
78,I'm of the mindset of keeping business and anything controversial separate. There isn't enough of a benefit to risk your business. I have seen too many business owners lose everything because they took a side.
79,Yeah but other dumb Christian‚Äôs eat that shit up.
80,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIB1-EeuZHI&t=30s
81,"*adjective
1.
considered in relation or in proportion to something else.*

In this instance relative to our paradigms/points of view.. yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure that was used correctly. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è guess that‚Äôs also *relative*"
82,Or you can ask any programmer/it-guy to hack into the Illuminati
83,How did you go about getting his full name? I feel like these guys could be paranoid and wonder if there‚Äôs a smooth way to ask.
84,Semen Demons is a good one too.
85,"Please don't. It's a term from r/childfree a sub that sounds good on the surface, but is actually a group for people who have an unreasonable level of hate for every single child and parent on the planet."
86,"Free will means do what you want but if it does not match up to what I want, you will burn in hell forever."
87,You're a wise person.
88,"Yes, that is true. But I think younger people have twigged to the con.

For example, one religion news oriented website I frequent has at least one article a week about some youth pastor or snake jiggler or priest busted for...well, you know.

These reports add up and it just can't be ignored.

Sometimes the internet's are a Good Thing."
89,It's the same amount of time either way.
90,"Most of the time they're exactly as narcissistic as you'd expect. In my case, he had his name plastered all over his signs and he was the hate preacher out of a church he hosted at his house. 

Granted, that house's address was hidden. All that I could see was a PO box; and to be clear, I did not want to know his home address."
91,There‚Äôs also /r/pastorarrested
92,I love it that this topic is a sub. We need this resource in case. Could come in real handy sometime.
