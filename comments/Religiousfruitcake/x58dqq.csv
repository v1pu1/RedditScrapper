1,Oh no Grandpa thinks it's the 1980s again
2,"Nah, made up stories.."
3,**OH THE HORROR! *THE DODECAHAEDRONS!!!***
4,"Câ€™mon, there are a LOT better things to bring back from the â€˜80s than the Satanic Panic. Like arcades, 24-hour music videos on MTV, frozen yogurt stands, glam metal . . ."
5,"Oh, this is where Jack Chick tracts went"
6,"Dungeons and Dragons. Satan's game. Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo!

7,"""Dangers"""
8,"Looks terrifying.

Oh, the humanity.

I think I'll take a shit."
9,"Wow, enough content for over one whole hour of bullshit."
10,"> Lemme guess... cherry-picked data?

Had a look at it, and ""cherry-picked data"" would be a very generous way to describe... whatever that was.

As far as I could bear to watch the content was:

1. 4 people who have no idea what an RPG is giving their hot takes
2. An undercurrent of satanic panic tripe
3. *A lot* of ""you can play a wizard, but the Bible says sorcerers bad. Look at this Bible quote where it says sorcery bad. Did we mention the Bible is against sorcery? Isn't it worrying people are pretending to be something the Bible explicitly opposes, like sorcerers? Watch this video of players describing their characters. What did you notice? The characters [a warlock, wizard, druid, paladin and rogue] are all -GASP- witches of some sort. And the Bible is against magic.""
4. Stretches so great I'm surprised they didn't injure themselves: like they quote a paper about the use of role playing in *clinical settings* - patients and therapists - for treating mental and behavioural issues and naturally extrapolate that out to mean RPGs are being used to modify the behaviour of players to sin."
11,This shit makes me laugh  I'm surprised 40k or aos hasn't riled up religious nuts
12,The funny thing is that's exactly what the Christian fruitcakes believe in the show ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
13,Most likely completely made up statistics and bullshit.
14,Cue satanic panic
15,And whatâ€™s this? Oh No! Theyâ€™ve brought out the *Icosahedron*!
16,I actually didnâ€™t see the video cause I didnâ€™t wanna waste my time tbh.
17,"I ran cleric of Asmodeus in Pathfinder and now I worship Satan! Beware!

/s"
18,"One of my players parents hate DnD (very strict religious types). I play a classic Paladin which quite literally is a lawful good holy warrior much like a real life Knights Templar whose devout to God. I tried to tell her how to justify to her parents saying use the reasoning ""Paladin's magic is like Jesus healing people with miracles"". There was no reasoning, even with a Cleric or Paladin there was no open mindnenss to seeing what this game is even about."
19,You made a very wise decision.
20,I did watch a several hour long documentary on why DC and Marvel characters are fallen angels. So I didnâ€™t wanna make the same mistake twice
