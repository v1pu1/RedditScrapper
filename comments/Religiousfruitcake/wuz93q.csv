1,"Tupac said it best, ""more people have died in the name of the lord than in any natural disaster, disease, or gang war. "" religious text doesn't unify its believers and passages are often interpreted subjectively. We develop theories based on what science tells us, not a fucking storybook written by a rando when people thought everything they didn't understand must be magic."
2,Apparently there's nothing holding a Christian back from becoming the next Hitler or King Leopold or Jim Jones.  They have no right to claim moral superiority.
3,Atheists = Country in Asia
4,It's hilarious that those who believe in some omnipotent beard in the sky worry about the realistic people
5,"Atheism has no explanation for the origin of the universe, but neither does my recipe for risotto."
6,"""Origins of the universe"" ... remind me, where did God come from?"
7,"Well thank god, there is just the one unified text that unites all theists and there is nothing subjective in religion"
8,Apparently there are books holding back religious people from being assholes.  Adolf Hitler and the Ayatola Komani and Kenneth Copeland all read their's.
9,"If your religious beliefs are the only thing stopping you from becoming the next Mao, please, seek therapy"
10,"The Bible explicitly supports genocide against worshippers of ""false gods."""
11,"And what stopped (the CHRISTIAN) Hitler from doing what he did? Nothing! What stopped the (CHRISTIAN) Nazis from their crimes? Nothing, they believed their god ENCOURAGED it!"
12,"Atheism doesn't have an explanation for the origin of the Universe because it isn't MEANT to explain anything. It is merely a lack of belief in the existence of deities.


About the rest; most atheists DON'T end up doing that anyway, what's stopping you from doing evil stuff?"
13,"Myanmar isn't even atheist, lol; the vast majority are Buddhist and Buddhism holds special recognition. Granted, it's all devil worship according to these people, but still."
14,"We do have a doctrine of beliefs, a blank sheet of paper. That pretty much sums it up."
15,Thank God I'm an atheist
16,Someone should tell him about what God Fearing Christians did in the 30 Years War. Or the Great War. Or the Belgians or the Congo.
17,"Yes, because becoming a mass murderer like Mao or Stalin is soooooo tempting /s"
18,I donâ€™t want to be a country :(
19,"Beware the leaders pretending to be Christians, that includes church leaders."
20,"We Belgians are so happy to even be mentioned in an international context, that I was pleased to see the name ""King Leopold"" for a moment. But it didn't last long."
21,"Be careful man, your risotto recipe might make people into the next myanmar."
22,Also clearly no atrocities were committed under the rule of the church or by the hands of protestant pilgrims. None whatsoever. Utterly preposterous.
23,"The Ayatollah Adolf Copeland.

I'll see myself out."
24,"Funny thing. The first Reich used religion as a way to justify their expansion. Why was that the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire fought each other? A tip, atheism had nothing to do.

From the beginning, Hitler had no influence from atheism, just as his Reich. But as always, preaching Christians like always showing their ignorance and expecting the rest are as ignorant and stupid as them."
25,Every sunday I drive my kids to the church of atheism and they have to recite the entire blank sheet of paper!
26,B*lgium ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®
27,"No wait!  I appreciate that comment!  Give him a little mustache and a scarf, perfect!"
28,Do I detect a delightfully obscure _Restaurant At The End Of The Universe_ reference?
29,Pssh Belgian beer is legit. Smdh
30,I was being sarcasmic.
31,I did.
32,B**rðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®
33,Portmanteau alert!
34,One of my favorites!
