1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Couldn’t possibly say enough good things about maintenance worker who called in that tip to law enforcement! After so long as is, Said likely never would have been caught otherwise.

EDIT / if you haven’t see the documentary about this case called The Price of Honor (available on Amazon Prime), I highly recommend it. It’s absolutely heartbreaking what Amina and Sarah went through, and knowing there are so many others like them."
2,"This guy had no defense. On the run for 12 years is not the behavior of an innocent man. I hope his son, his brother and anyone else who helped him all those years get just as much time as he gets."
3,No one should excuse or tolerate murder in any form or shape.
4,From 2000 fucking 8??
5,"Shame the POS didn't get the death penalty, now he'll just sit in jail jerking off to his 72 virgins and feeling all fucking righteous. And plenty of assholes will think he did the right thing and write to him, telling him what a great guy he is and how AllahWallaBingBang has a special place for him in heaven. 

I fucking hate religion in any and all it's guises."
6,Good. Fuck that guy…..
7,Whats with thebworrd things over his mouth?
8,Enjoy your honor in prison asshole!
9,"this case always hit too close to home w me, glad that POS will //finally// be locked away.  hopefully the girls get a more peaceful resting place"
10,"Oh, no defense whatsoever!! It absolutely boggles my mind that he actually got on the stand and told the jury  that he ran out of his cab into the woods, leaving the girls alone, because he thought someone was trying to kill him! Such a bullshit story, it makes me so angry! 

Also, if we’re talking charging other folks involved, honestly, their mother needs to face some sort of consequences, but realistically, I doubt that’ll ever happen. I’m glad justice was at least served in his case. I will say one thing though, if I could see anything else happen in regards to this whole situation, I really just want to see their graves relocated out of that sorry excuse for a cemetery. I don’t know if you’ve dug that deep into this story or have seen the documentary, but man, just seeing where they’ve been left makes me equal parts irate and depressed."
11,"I know, it’s ridiculous. So many people assumed he had fled back to Egypt but there were a few that insisted he wouldn’t and that chances were he was still in the state. Nothing ever came of it until a maintenance worker at the apartment complex where the son was hiding him caught a glimpse and recognized him."
12,"I really hope so. I don’t know what it is about this case in particular that got me - maybe that they were my age or that it was just such a horribly sad turn of events in general - but it’s truly stuck with me for years now. I was absolutely astounded when I got a breaking news alert that he’d been caught. I’m not even usually a super emotional person but man I cried in the bathroom at work when I heard. What a senseless thing, I have no words."
13,">hopefully the girls get a more peaceful resting place

They're dead. Their brains aren't functional"
14,I don’t think I’ve seen the documentary. Is this it? [The Prince of Honor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3220114/)
15,Why did you felt obligated to say that?
16,"Yes, that’s the one. If you have Amazon Prime, it’s available there for free. There’s also one on YouTube from the channel Real Stories."
17,"Because some people think not being religious means being an asshole and constantly telling everyone nothing happens when they die. They’re probably young (I remember being like that when I was a newly non  religious 13 year old). If people keep telling them not to act like that, they might eventually get that doesn’t help."
