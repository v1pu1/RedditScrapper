1,"Wait till they tell you that there are chariots visible on the bottom of the Red Sea, or that Noah's Ark is on mount Ararat."
2,"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John can’t even get the Jesus resurrection story straight and they all lived through it. Sure, the whole Bible is “unified”"
3,"Archaeological evidence points to the Jews never having been slaves in Egypt, but sure, go on about how the Bible is entirely truthful and can be verified."
4,Muslims say the same about the Quran. It’s me. I used to say it 🤣
5,"Above the circled part:  ""Yet it is a perfectly unified book.""  If you google it you find find lists of completely contradictory quotes within the bible.  Circumcision:  Genesis requires it but Galations condemns it.  Incest: Deuteronomy and Leviticus condemns it, but in Genesis God encourages it with Abraham.  Excuse me God, but WTF?"
6,"The only proof of the Bible is in the Bible. Without that text, you couldn't recreate any part of the religion."
7,"It's funny when they say this, cause there is literally no evidenceto support anything in the bible, from any outside sources. And most things said in the bible, are directly and irrefutably proven wrong by sources outside of the bible. Saying the bible is historically accurate is like claiming a movie ""based on true events"" is accurate. Sure, some of the general framework may be there, but none of the details are right, and it goes way off the rails."
8,"And Abraham Lincoln was a renowned Vampire Slayer.  

I read it in a book and if you check it for historical accuracy, it can be proven that Lincoln was in all the places they claim and at the time it's claimed."
9,source: trust me bro
10,Circular cult “logic.” The Bible is true because the Bible says the Bible is true. They really are brainwashed.
11,"Rust Cohle- You gotta get together and tell yourself stories that violate every law of the universe just to get through the goddamn day? What’s that say about your reality?"""
12,Ah! The God is real because it says so in the bible..
13,"All you need to do to be able to see the ""evidence"" is accept jeebus into your heart..."
14,One Fruitcake is Not Like the Others
15,"Lisa the rainbow giraffe, ""leaf be upon her"". I hear all about her from skeptick the talking circle youtuber."
16,No way man. The ark is in Kentucky. Jesus told me so
17,"One or more ships carrying chariots could have sunken in the Red Sea.

The other claim... no. Unless they're referring to the natural rock formation on Mt. Ararat that could be imagined to look slightly like the remains of the hull of a huge ship, that somehow turned to rock over four thousand or so years. That's a stretch."
18,"Wait till you point out that the bible wasn't written in English and has been translated many many different ways that often contradict each other, making it an impressively unreliable text."
19,"They have no proof, if they did, you'd never, ever hear the end of it.  

Religion is lies told as reality.  Ask a religious person for reality, you'll get lies, fiction, and whatever they make up on the spot."
20,"I’m not 100% sure, but didn’t they find stuff about Pilate or something?"
21,">Ararat

oh no, no, not the name, no"
22,Not one of the gospels was written during the time Jesus was supposedly alive. They were likely written over a span of about 50 years using cultural tellings of the life of Jesus and no actual claims of eye witnesses. But most Christians are taught that it was all first-hand accounts of people writing it as it was happening.
23,"This whole thing reminds me of the stuff a scammer says to give ""proof""

""Sir, if you kindly send the money by western Union, I have much more evidence than any other provider that I am legitimate. No one else has so much valid certification."""
24,"Glad you got un-brainwashed. It's one of the hardest things to escape because you don't know you're in it.

Im used to hearing this from catholicism. They don't just stretch the truth, they flat out make stuff up that even their own history."
25,And let’s not get started on the gospels.
26,"Yeah, the New Testament changing the rules is confusing"
27,"This is only my interpretation but Old Testament really emphasises the importance of Tribes of Israel so I think the point about incest makes sense but is never properly explained - incest is bad because of defects but it's necessary if a Tribe would cease to exist otherwise. The whole point of story of Onan was exactly this, after Onan's brother died (by God's hand btw) he was supposed to impregnate his brothers wife, refused and died as well. The widow then had to pretend to be a prostitute and seduce Onan's father all because a male line of one of the Tribes would die out otherwise. 

Funny how this extremaly important plot point is completely disregarded by Christians."
28,Pretty sure Noah is suing his insurance company
29,Did Jesus look like [this](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/230538/ken-ham.jpg?w=1600&h=1600&q=88&f=51f5fe1ffb6a953ea06f0ba3c43a417d)?
30,I am ridiculing people who say that. There are people who commit fraud targeting naive religious people.
31,"Shit, right?  ""The bible as a moral code"" basically means you can do whatever the fuck you like cause it's in the bible somewhere."
32,"Family line, important, got it.  My parents and grandparents are all only children.  I've got one sister.  Does this mean....?"
33,Someone should just tell him that was all part of gods plan
34,Over rain.
35,"No, Jesus was definitely whiter than that."
36,"Correct. If not, you can always fall on an apologetic or upg."
37,"Not just any family line, you have to be both Jewish and be from a tribe that has no male children. Old Testament writers weren't too invested in any non adult males or non-Jews in general."
38,He probably doesn't like Drake
39,Wooo! That's a relief.
