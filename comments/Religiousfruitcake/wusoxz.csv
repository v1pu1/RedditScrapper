1,"“If I had a daughter…”

The silver lining of this shit post is that they don’t have a daughter."
2,"""use a contraceptive""?

Okay I'll ask the rapist next time to think about me when he's raping me.

WTF"
3,So they can forget a guy completely traumatizing a  women or little girl for LIFE but not the said girl for aborting an unwanted baby? These people shouldn’t be allowed to have children in the first place
4,What a sack of shit. Unreal.
5,"so, I'm expecting they wouldn't feel comfortable explaining to a 10 year old girl why she needs to use contraceptives"
6,"""Unless you're bound, use a contraceptive"".

Always keep a condom in your pocket, you know, in case you get raped!  
""Hey, you seem like a reasonable guy. Before you force yourself on me, could you put on this condom?"""
7,Contraception fails regularly and so does this fool’s argument.
8,"Thankfully, doctor-patient confidentiality is a thing, and bigots are not psychic. If they had a daughter and she had an abortion, they need never know"
9,"Of course he believes a woman who aborts a pregnancy that was the result of rape is worse than the rapist. After all, these people hate women, especially the ones who don't fall in line with their shitty beliefs."
10,https://youtu.be/ebBelcvWXks where you can find more of how these people actually think.
11,"""If I had a daughter"". Yeah. Always seem to be the ones who are in no danger of facing a particular nightmare that are quickest to condemn others for their choices."
12,This is what happens when you don’t vote. These people become more powerful.
13,">Forget the rapist

No."
14,"“ takes up arms against the child”

these fuckers are complete drama queens"
15,"Well we'll well, found the rapist and rape and incest supporter.

They always out themselves, don't they.

They will forgive a literal murderer, a rapist who is obviously engaging in violent felony crime and childrapist. Obviously antichoicer issue is not with committing violence against innocents.

Nope, please note the one thing all of these have in common is that these are (violent) choices men made for women, but a woman having an abortion is choice she made for herself that is refusing to obey the choice men made for her!  

This fact is what makes it crystal clear that her refusal to obey a man's choice is the real reason antichoicers are so rabidly against abortion access."
16,The unsentient  fetus shouldnt pay for the sins of its father but thw sentient woman should pay for the sins if her rapist. Sounds fair.
17,My jaw just kept on dropping
18,Being disowned by an assclown like that would probably be the best thing that ever happened to her...
19,burn in hell asshole
20,Oh what a caring parent. Clearly a good Christian/s
21,Okay and he instantly becomes the sinister one when he wants to disown his daughter who was just raped. These people are literally insane. Their views are so stupid and they don’t even realize it.
22,"I am still trying to wrap my head around this one: “unless you are bound, pregnancy is not immediate, use a contraceptive.“

So let’s ignore for a minute that if you are using ropes and handcuffs pregnancy must be immediate. We’ll just take that one off the table because it’s sort of superfluous. 

So, pregnancy is not immediate, use a contraceptive. Do they think a condom is useful after the fact? Do they believe that I can somehow go buy some birth-control pills, pop a couple of them, and there will be no pregnancy? Or are they thinking of the morning after pill, which is certainly an option… IF you are a particular weight, and IF you have not happened to have ovulated. (Plan B prevents ovulation. If the egg is already released, it won’t do any good.) That’s hardly a guarantee of anything… better than nothing, but not the slam dunk they seem to think it might be. These medications are also under attack, as are standard birth control pills. This feels like the argument “We’re leaving it up to the states!“ and in the same breath “We need to take this ban nationally!” “All you have to do is use contraception! Until we ban it!“ 

I’m really dying to know exactly what they think “use a contraceptive“ means. Specifically. In detail. Because I feel like they are working off some sort of misinformation. The kind of grade school nonsense that we heard growing up… “If you have sex, use a douche afterward, so you won’t get pregnant.” “You can’t get pregnant if you have sex in a swimming pool.” “You can’t get pregnant if it’s your first time.”"
23,"If she had any kids, im sure they dont have shit to do with her anymore."
24,Wow. What a nut job. No ability to put themselves in another’s shoes.
25,All of you are assuming these people have two brain cells and use them logically.
26,"This is why I stay home more than I go out.  I don't want be near nutters like this, and if I have learned nothing else from Reddit, its that people like this out number the people like me."
27,And people say religion isn't dangerous.
28,"If these people want to live in a society like that, they should move to a theocracy like Saudi Arabia or Iran."
29,zamn bro that’s way too many words for “no woman will fuck me so i attack them out of insecurity”
30,The first two sentences were really bad. Then it got worse.
31,"Reminds me of my mom ""well, even if you're raped, it isn't the baby's fault"" no, it isn't, but I shouldn't be forced to carry a child that I was forced to conceive"
32,"Ah yes, Christianity, the religion of love. So much love in that post."
33,So pro life they support child abandonment and rape
34,[deleted]
35,"> if I had a daughter... I would disown her

This may be the only case in history where the victim actually *was* asking for it."
36,Now that’s a sick fuck.
37,"Turned into selfaware wolves at the end there, yikes."
38,This is why I don't waste my time at church. 🚴🏞🏖🏊🛀🎮🔭🌌
39,r/iamatotalpieceofshit (altho this kinda applies to everyone who gets posted here)
40,"How fast is the speed of thought, exactly?"
41,Atleast he doesn't  have a kid.
42,I thought “pitty” referred to a pit bull at first. I honestly needed a couple reads to figure it out.
43,My pitty....? Lol
44,"Aren't contraceptives frowned upon by your party cause they're evading the consequences of sex or something? Also, it sounds like you know as little as me as to how they work. Would they even work in that sitation?

""If I had a daughter""

So you don't even have experience raising a child, but should you even you'd immediately disown them for something you have decided is despicable for little logical reason.

You somehow believe that making your theoretical child feel the pain and trauma of abandonment is not nearly as evil as letting them not be forced into this broken miserable life? How fucked up are you?"
45,Reading things like these makes me feel like I'm so ready to adopt kids who got disowned by their parents and make sure they grow up 10x better than their own parents.
46,Then don’t you fucking dare have a daughter.
47,Disowning your child is never an acceptable outcome to a situation.
48,"Don't worry, they're voting to punish yours because clearly they know what's best for her. They go to church so how could they be wrong?"
49,"I remember learning about a case like this in Texas. The jury found that asking the rapist to wear a condom was effectively giving consent. From a quick Google, ""On September 30, 1992, a Travis County, Texas grand jury comprised of seven women and five men refused to indict Joel Rene Valdez, a rape suspect who complied with a woman's request that he wear a condom."""
50,"They MAY be referring to emergency contraceptives (aka Plan B) - something not every victim of sexual abuse has access to, and not just because christofash keep trying to ban those, too. 

I swear, these people don't know shit about what it's like to be abused. Or poor. Or a child."
51,I was thinking the same thing. Logic escapes this fool
52,Don't you see that by aborting the fetus you are denying another more important human all the experiences of life which may or may not include getting raped. But if we keep that chain of rape babies going then at some point statistically speaking there will be a baby that grows up to become Jesus and that will justify everything!/s
53,Oh see now you're just giving consent to sex so clearly it isn't rape/S
54,"Well actually Roe protected confidentiality for Pregnancies so let's say if they go out to a blue state for an abortion rather than an underground abortion in a red state family members could possibly report you for getting an abortion even if it wasn't in a red state and the records would be searched through 
Kinda like the 10yr old that went to Indiana for an abortion"
55,"One person writes-

""Why do people get so angry when parents leave a child/ baby in a hot car...when they are so quick to want to abort a child from a womb? Both kill. Such double standards"" 
And the response is ""Right you are! You hit the nail on this one"".

My head seriously hurts."
56,"Ignorance no longer works as an excuse for abject cruelty and abuse. Hasn't worked since ww2 ""ich wusste nicht"" (I did not know) failed as defense"
57,"They aren't prolife they are pro forced birth. They don't give a shit about anyone's life, except their own."
58,"You are giving them far too much credit. Also, does it actually matter what their ""true beliefs"" are if they vote for the extremist taking away our rights?"
59,If she thought about what might have been 6 years later is that a 6 year thought?
60,"Interesting, so if I ask my murderer to use a method that kills me quickly, I'm consenting to getting murdered?"
61,what the actual fuck? so if rapists wear condoms it's not rape anymore?
62,I remember that.. I was 21 at the time. Fucking terrifying. It’s always Texas..
63,Of fucking course it is Texas. What is wrong with this state being filled with these kind of people.
64,Sounds like texas
65,"That's the first thing I thought of, a lot of conservatives straight up think the morning after pill is just a chemical abortion"
66,Wasn’t someone found not guilty of rape because the girl being assaulted begged for him to at least use a condom? Fucking terrible.
67,"Some states have made laws against that, i think Massachusetts is one. Basically Massachusetts will not cooperate with other states investigations into medical anything done in there state even from out of state."
68,"One is using someone's body for sustenance and growth while also for majority of its time not having pain receptors

The other not using someone's body for life and also can feel pain and can suffocate

They are really not smart"
69,"I'm not from Texas, but I assume in Texas it's a yes."
70,"Only if you're a woman, oh and if you are wearing a skirt or jeans or.... you're asking for it, and if you had a drink you wanted it, and when you're outside after 9pm you were clearly asking for it"
71,"I think it's more ""If you ask him to and he complies, it's no longer rape, because why didn't you just ask him not to rape you if he was so amenable?""

It's fucking stupid."
72,"Anything for them other than sex between a man and a woman in order to have children is an abortion. In my country for example, even recently Catholic shit like ""we disagree with sex, we only do it so we can have children, woman should count to 10 strokes and if a man isn't done by then she should be annoyed, we don't support IVF though"" and priests consider oral sex an abortion"
73,Yup. Texas. There's another comment on here with more details.
74,"On top of that, the reasons for one or the other. 

Leaving your child in a car is just pure neglect.
The reasons to have an abortion vary so much and usually come down to avoid neglecting your child...."
75,"if i get kidnapped and ask for food and kidnapper gets me a pizza, that means I wasn't kidnapped ig"
