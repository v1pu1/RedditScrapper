1,When will they understand that in their religion God =/= Jesus.
2,That reads like there was a lot of heavy breathing going on while it was typed with one hand.
3,"Yay threats as conversion, and let me guess we’re supposed to love this monstrous being you’re describing and worship him? Yeah no… If this being actually existed as described, everyone would realise that he’s the enemy of every thinking being in existence. Good thing he’s fictional…"
4,Death cult is the only way to describe christianity.
5,Carrots and sticks. It's all about carrots and sticks and me me me!!!
6,That’s the most rational argument for Jesus I’ve ever read.
7,Nooooooooooo
8,Imagine operating all of your life on the threat of torture and then thinking that God loves you
9,"> When you're standing in front of God, u won't be thinking about BIGGIE, 2PAC, SEX...

Oh, I'll be thinking about sex [gives God a lascivious wink]"
10,As I said to the local fire brand priest (after harassing  my gf and condeming us to hell) I'll see you down there keep hell warm for me
11,Needs more O's.
12,"Cool. Keeps jamming to Black Sabbath.
That was a whole Lotta rap hate."
13,"Jesus fucking Christ...

14,"It was under a biggie smalls video you know that song 


“If I die I wanna go to hell, cause I’m a piece of shit it ain’t hard to fucking tell, It don’t make sense going to heaven with the goody goodies, dressed in white I like black timbs and black hoodies”

Which is completely ironic, I can guarantee you no “saved” Christian is listening to that song without no conviction, the first bars literally renounce the whole point of being Christian"
