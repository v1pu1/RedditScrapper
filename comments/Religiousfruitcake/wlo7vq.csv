1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"So, god the all powerful and wise can make no sense at all if he wants to?

God sounds like an idiot"
2,"Imagine a bible that needed no translation, no explanation, was understood in the same way by each reader, that would be proof of divinity. 

Instead we have a book that became the basis of thousands of incompatible faiths. All self validating, all rigid in its views, worth killing each other over. 

Sounds like a Bronze Age book best left to goat herders to me."
3,"Delusionals struggling to understand why their superstitious nonsense doesn't make sense and is false.

(But Its logically illogical and makes perfect sense being confusing. It so confusing that is clearly obvious. It's suposed to not make sense. I don't read it of course. Did you know jesus was an American who had a golden Russian AK and he went round shooting liberals.)

Do I need the /s for  the second part. Sadly I do."
4,Is it just me or do these people have the capability to write a novel that doesnt really say anything in the end.
5,This reads like the stream of consciousness of somebody desperate to convince themself that their religion is true.
6,"Well, yes 

But also yes"
7,"I also don't see how you can take ""god created the world in 7 days literally"" and something else is a metaphor, did god literally try to get Abraham to sacrifice Isaac or was that a metaphor? How do you decide?"
8,I Absolutely agree
9,"Lets be honest, even that doesnt proof divinity, 1+1=2 is understood by all and has no divine traits"
10,I read this three times and I zero idea what the author is trying to conveyâ€¦
