3,Cured this but can't cure cancer.
4,Christianity: How To Suppress Yourself
5,Jesus... Fuck me... Harder... Ahh aww ahhh
6,Plot twist: [this is Jesus \(NSFW\)](https://thumb-p6.xhcdn.com/a/j5F_70_bUvL8WJeGCoA58w/000/210/474/056_1000.jpg)
7,lol saved.... Fucking brainwashed.
8,"‚ÄúFrom being lesbian to a real woman‚Äù is what got me lmfao, tragic post but man that‚Äôs just funny."
9,"How is this legal

Edit: conversion therapy"
10,If you told these people heterosexuality was an illness they would bring it up around people for the rest of their lives
11,Is she bi now?
12,Poor thing.
13,She‚Äôs still a lesbian. Just probably lonely now
14,"She is still lesbian but now it's mandatory to hide her sexuality

Goddamn, why those people are so homophobic?"
15,Maybe it was the vitamin D that saved her?
16,Now she‚Äôs a victim of religious stupidity. I feel sorry for her.
17,"Religious people: We don't hate LGBT

Also religious people:"
18,I hope this isn‚Äôt some random woman and they chose her photos online making claims about her.
19,"This is gonna make me sound like a pretentious, sticking my views down everyone‚Äôs throat, but it‚Äôs shit line this that makes me so glad I accepted myself for who I am. Like I feel sorry for her being either brainwashed or pushed back into the closet but like damn, I love pissing these people off."
20,The world is filled with such dumb fucks .
21,"I don't get the before/after, what's supposed to be wrong with the left pic? lol. It's just got different lighting."
22,"straight people who say 'being gay is an illness' when someone says that being straight makes you a square:

#'What the absolute FUCK did you just say to me? I can't fucking TAKE this blatant DISRESPECT towards me! (incoherent babbling)'"
23,Rare to find posts that enduce nausea. This is one of them. Sickening.
24,I'm glad that now she's brainwashed instead of homosexual :D
25,Jesus come inside meh‚Ä¶
26,Id worship that jesus
27,Saved is the far from new code word for doomed ^ ^ ‚Äô .
28,"Tbh you don‚Äôt know if there was actual conversion therapy done, more likely she was bullied and told she was going to hell enough times that peer pressure caused her to ‚Äúrepent‚Äù and go back into the closet"
29,What exactly? Changing a belief?
30,"Apparently bi people don't exist, you can only be straight or gay /s"
31,Always has been (?)
32,"That's the best case scenario, but it's entirely possible she's suppressing being a lesbian."
33,It is possible this Facebook (?) post is made by some her fellow cultist. I think it should eventually be illegal to pressure anyone to change sexuality. But outlawing conversion therapy is the first step.
34,This has been insufficient evidence that show sexuality can be changed. It is not a belief. What she is doing is repressing her behaviors and maybe thoughts. It would very likely lead to long term issues.
35,Dad?
36,Who said you can be gay üò°üò°üò°
37,I still don't understand your OC. Should it be illegal for people to change their sexual preference?
38,"Should a procedure that affects a person‚Äùs long term wellbeing be licensed, regulated and supported by scientific evidence? Should your doctors and psychologists have the same standard? It is one thing if one day she decides to not sleep with women any longer. It is another thing for some (religious) organizations to say we can help you achieve this. And that is if you come voluntarily at all. Look at the left picture. It could be nothing but it also could be that she is involuntarily sent to some camp, which is the majority of these cases. Abduction are common in these camps. 

Sexuality is also not a belief to start with. That would imply a heterosexual can become homosexual if they choose to. 

Not to mention it is not an illness (like marked in the picture), APA has removed that ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù decades ago."
39,your choice of words tells a lot
40,"
>That would imply a heterosexual can become homosexual if they choose to.

Well, $20 is $20, right?"
41,"I think I'm with you but 

""Sexuality is also not a belief to start with. That would imply a heterosexual can become homosexual if they choose to. ""

Why can't they?"
42,"You completely avoided my question somehow. I still don't understand. I will try again. 

What exactly do you think should be illegal?"
43,Your evasion of my question tells more.
44,Lol I know you‚Äôre joking but I just want to make sure to distinguish sexuality and sexual practice.
45,"I think it‚Äôs important to distinguish sexual orientation and sexual practice. You can say one day you‚Äôre not sleeping with anyone anymore, but you will continue feel the attraction only to repress it. This repression will most often cause long term harm. This long-winded [APA article](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation) basically says 1) there‚Äôs no evidence that shows you can change sexual preferences 2)‚ÄùBelief in the hope of sexual orientation change followed by the failure of the treatment was identified as a significant cause of distress and negative self-image‚Äù   

So even sexual preferences may be fluid and change over time, the change is mostly not coerced (by self or by others). 

Sexual preference also has biological/epigenetic causes. Think of Autism and other neurodevelopmental ‚Äúconditions‚Äù. It seems unlikely to change."
46,Conversion therapy. Like I said if you have bothered to read. It is not illegal for her to change her practice of sexuality. It should be illegal for some organizations to offer these ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and reasons were listed.
47,"I see, I think I'm on the same page now. I wonder if people often put too much emphasis on sexual orientation, at least where I live in the US. If someone likes what they like (or is attracted to what they are attracted to)... do they really need to be labeled? It seems like the way some people are with food. Like when I was a kid I loved ketchup, ate it all the time. For whatever reason now as an adult I hate it, not even on fries. Nothing bad associated with it I just don't like it, and I doubt any amount of psychological programming is going to change that. I assume there are some kind of primal biological functions that govern sexuality (orientation?) which is obviously a different mechanism from food but it's still something that we don't really control... So I think you helped me put that piece in the puzzle. The way I see it, people being up in arms about it might as well be protesting the consumption of ketchup, or tacos."
48,"Do you have any source? The post does not mention conversion therapy at all.

From all I know she could have found jesus and converted by herself before joining the cult a year later."
49,"Tribalism runs deep in US (politics, sexual identities, a whole bunch labels like jock/nerd/frat/skater/slut n what not). Sometimes difficult for us in elsewhere in the world to understand why they are so obsessed with lumping people into groups‚Ä¶ Your ketchup analogy is great. If you forced your young self to suddenly stop eating it, you could have developed some eating disorder or just started drinking mayo instead (/s). When you grow up as adult, your body doesn‚Äôt need that much sugar, you stop craving it naturally. 

People who are obsessed with opposing ‚Äútacos‚Äù are usually the ones that say ‚Äúfood should not be fun‚Äù. They don‚Äôt care about what make people happy but take pleasure in bending people to their rules. Reasons are complicated but religious indoctrination is one of them since we are on this sub."
50,"It could be a friend but also could be someone showcasing their ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. If it were a friend, the wording of homosexuality is very hostile. Maybe that is why she felt she had to ‚Äúchange‚Äù her sexuality. These friends are certainly doing a very wrong thing."
51,"I've been putting some thought into US culture as it is affected by religion and tribalism lately. Probably because I watched Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" the other day. The characters seem to be some type of Puritans, which I've read were so extreme they were basically chased out of every other place they tried to settle in. If that's where our society gets its roots I can see how we have these dividing characteristics in our culture. Even hundreds of years later. Anyway, it's a great watch if you like horror, apparently Eggers' went to a lot of trouble to make it as period accurate as possible. Thanks for the refreshing discussion! Cheers!"
