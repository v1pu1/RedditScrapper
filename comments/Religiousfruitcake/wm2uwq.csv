1,"""The bible is 100% true"" then they have to live it and then what"
2,"Creation is not an explanation, since magic did it has no explanatory power. 

If you need your value to be determined by a fictional monster, I feel very sorry for you. 

The bible is a collection of fairy tales that describe the earth as flat and predating… Damn, you already believe that. It’s incredibly telling though that the go to way to explain how the bible is not in fact 100% true for everyone else, doesn’t apply to you… 

When you build your worldview on a bunch of lies, both your literal and figurative foundation is far from firm. 

Show evidence that god exists to create anything, and the love of the god you believe in, includes infinite punishment, for finite crimes. That is infinitely evil, and does not describe love as anyone would recognise it, outside of this fictional monster. 

That’s not even to mention the genocides, slavery, rapes, and such which were all either comitted, promoted, condoned, or excused by this supposedly loving monster… 

And no, I won’t respond to your terrible strawman of the scientific view…"
3,I like how the light from the sun just decides to stop at an arbitrary line. Totally how light works...
4,"Satan here, can confirm I ain’t lying"
5,"*GOD LOVES YOU* is the most pathetic lie I've ever heard. Which one of the 10,000 Gods love me? If they did, then I'd surely be in a better situation than the shit hole I am in now. The people who believe God can pass them in their exams are the biggest idiots I've ever seen. 

Every God I've trusted has betrayed me and I had to end up finishing them off. As I always say, *There are no good Gods boy.*"
6,"""It's correct because it strokes our ego""."
7,They do… those other parts are allegorical
8,"Totally fucking agreed with you since there are still billions of people still believe in their nonexistant asshole god and shitty guide book aka the bible! 

I'm becoming an atheist currently since I've reading the damn bible itself, being psychologically abused by my religious nutjob parent, and doing research.

Hell even the christians claim that their God is 'Loving' despite his bloodlust, unfair punishments, and any terrible shits he had done."
