1,It's much easier to pretend it's a miracle than to admit your son or husband impregnated your daughter...
2,"Bruh i thought this would be a picture from a 1920s paper then i read the date, wtf LMAO. Also it's pretty fucked up that she's the youngest daughter and her mom had her at 17, that means she would have had the first kid at like 13..."
3,Adela>!ide!< claims that she never had sex. >!Adela!<ide lives with her mother. >!Ad!<elaid>!e!< could not be reached for comment.
4,"Five older brothers. 🤦‍♂️

This has to be satire right?

Sheltered kids in a kooky religious household in the deep south. Implied incest. The implication that they're trying to say the kid is a new Messiah. How can this not be a joke?"
5,Five older brothers? I think I've cracked the mystery.
6,"Never allowed to leave the house?
Always under supervision
5 brothers?
We have ourselves a little Lannister."
7,"Family friend as a chaperone, huh?"
8,Sounds like incest
9,"Ok, who wants to be the one to break it to the mother?"
10,Tbh if I remember this right this story is fake unless you can find the whole article there’s a ton of programs that can make fake news paper clippings
11,"Was thinking ‘there must be some guy in this story’

“Lives with her mother and 5 older brothers”

Oh…

OH!"
12,Same thing happened to my girlfriend. We were saving our selves for marriage. God is good!
13,"Why only censor half the name when that leaves enough to easily guess it, and you gave the news paper and printing date?"
14,Miracle my ass.
15,Ya that baby likely has some birth defects
16,"The kid comes out black.


NOT A MIRCLEE"
17,"""Claims""


Disproven. Next."
18,All I read was “5 older brothers”
19,Just another fruitcup trying to get her name in the news.  Move on!!!
20,"Yeah, right."
21,That baby is the antichrist.
22,I like how christianity’s biggest miracle is just human parthenogenesis
23,"Then I got to the ""...and five older brothers"" part, and it all made sense."
24,Possible incident: the girl got roofied and raped.
25,"Things like this make it obvious why certain lines in certain movies go viral and resound with audiences for all time. Like Jack Nicholsen's infamous line in the movie, ""A Few Good Men"":

     YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!"
26,"A ""miracle"" hmm? Are they absolutely certain that one of the older brothers didn't do it, and threaten her to keep quiet about it? Religion is a disease of the brain; it doesn't allow you to use common sense or rational thinking because ""GoD wOrKs In MySteRiOuS wAyS!!1!"""
27,the other subreddit I saw this on said this is AI generated lol
28,Sweet home alabama stars playing from the hospitals speakers
29,It kinda look like online graphic creator I used long time ago. You could make this newspapers with anything you'd want to.
30,You could make a religion out of this!
31,Always hated the miracle of birth. I ask how many people have been born to m the history of the planet? Billions? That by definition is not a miracle.
32,FIVE older brothers.
33,"How come it’s never ‘Miracle Birth: Painless and Over With in Five Seconds?’

That’s not a miracle to find yourself spontaneously pregnant - it’s a nightmare.

Edit:…….five older brothers. My mind is not making pleasant deductions. Someone is a shit mom and trying to cover up that they let something very bad happen on their watch."
34,One of the brothers or the father
35,Sweet home Alabama.
36,Sounds like sex abuse. Par for the course for fruitcakery
37,*looks at five adult brothers* virgin birth... sure.
38,I just assumed she managed to sneak a boy into the house somehow. It would seem I am naive compared to y’all lol
39,Fake. June Bruke is 35. Adelaide is the youngest and is 18.  So Ms. Bruke had her sixth child at 17.    That’s the real miracle.
40,5 older brothers ey? a meme comes to mind
41,Incest is best???
42,Doing the math here. Mom is 35. Daughter is 18. Mother had daughter around age 17. Mom has 5 older children. Jfc.
43,Yeah. Right.
44,Can anyone confirm that this is a fake article? I tried googling the names and the only other links are other Reddit posts
45,"DNA test, anyone?"
46,That is some Flowers in the Attic shit right there.
47,"I could be wrong, but I *think* it was unnecessary to censor ‘Adelaide’"
48,"Wait. Mother is 35, daughter is 18. Mother was 17 when she had Adie.

Adie has FIVE older siblings."
49,Why is this posted here?!?! I see a bonafide miracle 🤔
50,You could make a religion out of this
51,“Lives with five older brothers”….gross incest
52,so who’s gonna tell June that there’s a child predator in the family
53,"Girl: 18 
Mother: 35 

>FIVE OLDER BROTHERS!!!"
54,[I'd believe this if it wasn't made with a newspaper clipping generator](https://www.fodey.com/generators/newspaper/snippet.asp)
55,r/CensoringIsHard
56,Honestly this article was making me think if what she says is true then one of her brothers abused her. They should do a DNA test on that baby.
57,"Or the family friend. That’s exactly what I thought. 

Also, mom herself got pregnant at 17 so…

Imagine how much better all these lives would be if she had been able to have an abortion at 17 instead of a baby. This whole fucked-up family dynamic of religious insanity wouldn’t exist."
58,"Legit this sounds like an article written in the 1800s or early 1900s, no way this is 2020. The lack of critical thinking around this scenario is bizarre."
59,Child marriage is popular with these types of fundies.
60,Christians....
61,"I missed that. You’re so right. 

I wonder if those kids were conceived by mom’s own brothers now. 

Layers of sexual abuse happening there in Texas, to a lot of kids who shouldn’t have to endure that. 

Get your shit together, Texas. Jesus is watching you and he’s pissed."
62,Haha that’s what I thought then I looked for the date!
63,And then the mother's surname just straight up
64,"The mother is 35, meaning she gave birth to Adelaide at 17.

Five older brothers is barely possible. If she got pregnant three months after giving birth each time, that means she had the first at age 12, conceiving at 11. I was still bleeding after three months and can’t imagine getting pregnant again. To do that five times? No way."
65,"Yes, it's well-known that it takes five brothers to perform the holy ritual by which the spirit of God impregnates a virgin."
66,There was even an X-Files episode about this
67,Shh it was Jesus
68,Or a Habsburg.
69,"No such thing, can only be Jesus. Duh."
70,Smells like incest
71,"I think you’re right. Went looking for the article and all I could find was an ifunny post and this Reddit post.

I love to hate on religion, but we don’t really have to be making stuff up."
72,The writing is atrocious and not up to journalistic standards to begin with. My publication would never let this slide.
73,"Hey, it worked for Joseph and Mary."
74,Is this satire?
75,"just a screenshot, i wouldn't have censored it because these people decided to put it in the newspaper."
76,[ratio](https://r11.fodey.com/2744/e8e3daad22fa48f087a4676bdd350de6.0.jpg)
77,"How much older then her are the brothers? Because honestly, they are religious conservatives in the south west, it may not be abuse. I know it says she is only just 18, so her older brothers are over. But, if it is only a couple of years older, and it started when she was like 14 and one of them 16, then it isn't bad for any reason other then being incest.

Edit: What are people misunderstanding here? I am not saying incest is ok. Just simply that if started when all parties were minors with just a year or two gap, that isn't rape, still incest and wrong, but not rape any more. Unless they are all much older then her. Which is why I asked about that.

Edit: I'm also not saying there isn't abuse from the parents that would cause this, as there likely is. But two similar aged people being together doesn't make abuse or rape between them, even in incest. That is literally my only point. How do you de ide who the rapist is between a brother and sister of the same age when there isn't actual force being used? What makes that determination? It doesn't change that incest is wrong. But may not be rape. There still could be and likely is abuse from the parents. But with what is here, the brothers could be just as much victims. That is my point. Don't just take a knee jerk reaction and think I am excusing incest, rape, or an adult with a minor. I am not. I am pointing out we don't know the ages of the brothers from this, and they could be just as much victims. That was my only point. Holy crap it's amazing how people can jump to conclusions with out reading.

Edit: So, just because I pointed out that if they are close in age and both minors, that isn't automatically rape, people are assuming show how that means I am saying it can't be rape. Like no, I never said anything fucking close to that. Obviously rape can still happen between minors. I just said it isn't automatically rape if they are close in age and both minors, in the same way it is automatically rape for an adult to have sex with a minor, even if the minor claims to want it. That isn't a real yes, and is still rape. There is no way for it to not be rape in that situation. All I was pointing out, is that if both are close and minors at the time, that is not automatically rape in that same way. Not that it couldn't be. Holy shit."
78,She got pregnant much earlier than that if the 18yr old is the youngest out of 6. Most likely at 12/13
79,Either that or her parents literally gave her to some older guy as a kid.. extremely fucked up either way
80,"Right, it's insane that people are taking that seriously in 2020"
81,"Holy gang bang, batman."
82,I saw that one. Where the deformed sister was rolled out from under the bed on a mechanics creeper so the brothers could have sex with her and the monstrosity of a baby was buried alive in the yard. Creepy!!
83,"I watched all the X Files episodes as a kid when they came out and I barely remember any details, aside from major plot points. But that one hillbilly incest episode is burned into memory, every detail. And I only watched it once."
84,Who?
85,No my pastor says satire is satanic.
86,I only respect news if it comes from the ratio
87,What the hell did you just type out loud?
88,"Yes, this comment right here officer."
89,What a fucking shit take that is
90,Please tell me that this is some sort of satire or trolling I don't get.
91,I have never seen a louder cry for help than this comment
92,Josh?
93,Wait what?
94,"Oh honey, this is such a bad take. Let's say you are correct and the sex with her brother was consensual and he isn't significantly older. The fact that she even thought that was ok means she has had so little contact with others outside of her prison (oh, sorry, I mean home) that she has not been able to cultivate appropriate relationships. She has been so isolated from the outside world that she would form a sexual relationship with her own brother is utterly tragic and stems from abuse (i.e. isolation). 

But let's face it, it was almost certainly rape."
95,">But with what is here, the brothers could be just as much victims.

*Which still makes it rape.*"
96,"Incest in most cases includes coercion. Whether you like it or not, there is a power dynamic between siblings that can be exploited. How can you seriously say that an older sibling coercing his sister into having sex with him isn’t inherently horrific? Yes. It is rape. Rape does not always include forcing someone down and hurting them. It can include blackmail, manipulation, gaslighting, and a host of other tactics. It’s ignorant people like you that make women scared to come forward about sexual abuse. 

Edit, ALSO! A minor can rape another minor, you imbecile. If a boy forces himself on a girl is it suddenly not rape because they were both underage? Get your shit together, man"
97,"Bro typed 3 paragraphs about how it might be okay because it's just incest and is responding to EVERY comment trying to backpedal or dig himself deeper, what the fuck hahaha"
98,Wtf is this
99,It is not a bad idea to seek medication for the chemical imbalance in your head.
100,Damn bro just take your L and move on
