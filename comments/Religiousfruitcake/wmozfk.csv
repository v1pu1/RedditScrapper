1,the only answer to this can be “fuck your god and prophets. Fuck allah. And fuck you.”
2,what a “religion of peace” does to a mf
3,"Any god that requires you to murder in his name is a small, weak, pathetic idea of god

I don’t believe any gods exist, but I have great respect for those believers who have the courage and conviction to make the world a better place.

Those who would do murder, spread fear, act out terrorism, are pathetic cowards, as is their idea of god."
4,"Looking through BBC's FB page, you can find thousands of similar comments."
5,shouldn't god be able to defent itself?
6,That last sentence says it all
7,Go fuck fuck your god you flaming idiots
8,BuT islAM iS a PEacEfUL ReLigiON!
9,"Well, this is true. This is the AVERAGE Muslim. Only, a few but LOUD liberal Muslim westerners and nonmuslim westerners will say otherwise. That is why it pains me when someone defends this religion and tells everyone that it is culture and not religion and calls every criticism of the ideology ISLAMOPHOBIA. We have to NORMALIZE criticisms of Islam and not view them as racism. Islam is inherently violent."
10,"They need to accept not everyone will like them, you can't avoid insults or criticism from anything and since they claim these insults can't hurt their god or religion then where's the reason to be mad and take action"
11,I really wish for a possibility of afterlife. I badly want to see the faces of these people after dying and realizing that the religion and the prophet they have been defending for their entire life scammed them. Lol.
12,Such a peaceful religion
13,Oh how nice a person willing to commit violence for an imagined slight against an imaginary god and a book full of terrible advice.
14,"We are not like other religions who tolerate insults against their prophets or their God's 

We are WAY weaker than that! Our fragility and insecurity demand outrageous overreaction, overriding common sense, civility, decency, and basic morality."
15,We should not tolerate that douchnozzle's apostrophe misuse.
16,"Out of all the religions and bullshit cults, Islam is definitely the most fragile religion."
17,"And we will act against any extremist who would commit violence in name of their religion. You won’t win, your imaginary friend deserves no respect whatsoever."
18,">we are not like other religions who tolerate insults against their prophets or their god's

Translation: we are not like other religions who have stronger faith and are able to take criticism in a civilized manner."
19,"Your prophet is a liar, and your god is imaginary.  Come at me."
20,Serious inferiority complex happening here
21,these people do not belong in civilized societies..
22,"This message is an example of reprehensible behaviour.

The abuse of the apostrophe here is abhorent!"
23,Funny how their god can't take care of himself.
24,Yet many seem to not mind insulting other people’s prophets and gods.  The Golden Rule is as valid in Islam as in every other religion; do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
25,So you are all petty and not at all enlightened
26,Enjoys tolerance of Christians in the west and becomes intolerant peice of shit. Classic.
27,Our prophet's what?
28,Studies show this is false
29,Have you heard of forgiveness?
30,They don’t mean it. They’re the “religion of peace” guys.
31,@fbi
32,I don't take any religion seriously because there is no god or prophets that are able to defend their own religion
33,"Dear Muslims,

Pics or it didn’t happen. 

Love,
Rest of the world 😂"
34,"Here's the conundrum, either Allah is a weakling that needs humans to act in its place or they're arrogantly acting in its place and Allah doesn't really care. Either way, it makes the followers caring about people insulting their god look bad."
35,"Dumb, weak trash like that will struggle to get off the couch let alone defend anything."
36,Fuck Allah and fuck Muhammad (may piss be upon him).
37,"Awww diddums. Did the big bad atheist offend your widdle prophet? Shame. 

Allah works night shift at the corner 7-11 and Mohammad sucks dick behind it for 5 bucks."
38,"Ola hu uber
Assalam molecule"
39,"""We take our imaginary friends way too seriously and will blow up your infrastructure and murder people if you hurt our wittle feewings by saying mean things about him >:'("""
40,This is Islamophob- oh wait… they’re the ones saying it this time. Never mind.
41,Ah ok.  So a barbarian
42,Someone replied with a picture of Muhammed in drag xD
43,"If you do it publicly, someone out there will call you racist/Islamophobic. It will be reduced to racism and will spare Islam from criticism. Meanwhile, some Muslims will plan how to kill you."
44,Yes… they leave a piece of you here… a piece of you over there… oh and over there too!
45,"You have to understand that Allah is the diety of caravan robbers and bandits. Allah is a violent diety, it claims to be merciful but also gives very vivid explanation of punishment for rejecting it.

Muslims are paralysed by this diety, most Muslims are peaceful and just want to get on with their life but being religious demands doing Allah's bidding which is spreading the religion through peace and war, subjugating women and infidels. 

A lot of moderate Muslims don't know what to do with this fact so they tend to ignore the violent parts of Islam and only focus on the community aspect of Islam like giving charity, feeding orphans and celebrating festivals etc."
46,"Where I live there was a guy who drove 200 miles to kill another Muslim because he posted videos on YouTube where the murderer didn't like what was being said. The victim was Ahmadi, the murderer Sunni. 

Some Muslims do just want peace and tolerance while others feel they must kill (or at least severely punish) those who do not see the prophet as per their belief. They think committing murder can be justified on that basis and they'll get away with it. 

If you can't live in a (mostly) civilised society and follow their laws, go live in a land where you can do what you like."
47,"You would think so, but he can’t handle money and is also a snowflake."
48,How did they manage to get the idea that Islam is a race? Who started that?
49,Fr. How fragile their God is that he would get hurt from the words coming out from a mere humans mouth?
50,">a possibility of afterlife

My idea of afterlife is based on how you interpret it as. For example if you died a criminal, but wanted to reform, there's a place that acts like a rehab that's guided by entities.

Just my thoughts."
51,That works
52,That's really the best way to react to people like this.
53,Hopefully molesting an underage goat.
54,Link?
55,Or Muhammad bent over taking it from a pig.
56,Sauce?
57,"That's exactly what's happening in some areas that were supposedly anarchist subs.

The shitbirds who claim religion = race/ethnicity are trying to infect new victims."
58,"This is a remarkably bad take.

For much of its history, Islam was a religion of learning and peaceful cooperation.

Islamic cities, especially those in the region of Spain and Northern Africa, were places where all religions were welcome, and where knowledge was found.

It has problematic elements, as does every religion and none."
59,"The right-leaning people in the US attack Muslims by criticizing Islam. The Left defends them from the Right by labeling almost every criticism of Islam as racism or Islamophobia. In the end, it becomes the Left vs the Right, and Islam is unfortunately protected from being criticized."
60,"Could not find the post, but found the [image.](https://scontent.fltn3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/80325085_2437963376454883_8992878781509140480_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s320x320&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=1480c5&_nc_ohc=12dbfiedgzkAX8wfKTU&_nc_ht=scontent.fltn3-1.fna&oh=00_AT-hWsIe9OstH3K6PPn3dpL8op97ygC_Z0gZGsbNBaOSsA&oe=631AE6E2)"
61,that is the reason why I stopped frequenting r/atheism.
62,"Mass murder is problematic, as is raping a 9 year old."
63,"Yeah, fuck islam and fuck all religions"
64,"You clearly didn't read what I wrote then. Muslims try their best to be good despite Islam. Like I said Islam does have some good stuff in it but overall the Islamic theology and the quran is hostile to non believers.

Muslims leaders of that time were actually largely secular. Islamic thinkers were heavily influenced by Greek logic and philosophy, something which actual traditional Muslims hated and eventually managed to take power and oppressed the secular ideals in the Islamic world.

Oh and early history of Islam is full of attacking caravans, killing pagan poets and critics of Mohammad. Genocide of Jewish tribe, taking women as sex slaves, these are some of the early history of Islam which you claimed is largely peaceful."
65,Kinky
66,LMAO I am saving this for sure.
67,Ironic.jpg
68,"You’re acting as if Muhammad == Islam.

This is not a reasonable take."
69,"Allah is Mohammads alter ego so yes Muhammad is exactly = Islam

He got those supposed ""revelations"" in those cave and not someone else's so how it Islam not related to Muhammad ? 

To give shahada ( becoming a Muslim) you will have to recite a chant in Arabic "" La Ila Iilalla Mohammadur Rasulallah"" meaning there is ""There is no god but allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God"" 

It seems you don't know about Islam because you weren't born in it, smh"
70,I hate it when non Muslim liberals have this strange idea of a peaceful Islam. Why don't they ask ex Muslims what happens if your leave Islam? Islam is very clear about killing apostates.
