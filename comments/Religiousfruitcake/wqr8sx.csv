1,"Literally, the whole be gay but don't act on it mindset."
2,The most appropriate response to this would be: Is being straight a choice?
3,"""Rewards"" that you'll get in the ""afterlife"" which no one has ever shown to even exist."
4,"Yeah, so why does this nut not overcome the temptation of engaging in heterosexual activities? ""Rules for thee, but not for me"" principle?

Also, people who call being gay etc a choice need to be locked up for being dangerously stupid."
5,Prove the rewards exist
6,"So uh- Love is a struggle that god gifts us? So we shouldn't love? And in return, we get imaginary awards that a book from hundreds of years ago with no evidence told us we'd get? Yeah makes sense."
7,"Also Jesus plainly says in Matthew 5:27-28 that whosoever looks upon a woman with lust has committed adultery in his heart. It doesn’t matter if you act on it or not. Just the desire is enough to be a “sin” according to their messiah, so the “it’s ok to want to as long as you don’t do it” argument is complete bs.  Also, the opportunity to fail to overcome a sin that is essentially as uncontrollable as a reflex and burn in hell is a gift from god? The shit that comes out of people’s mouths, I swear. Christians have the most abusive relationship with their sky daddy."
8,So... ...what are the rewards and can you show them to me?
9,Which sub is this
10,I always like to ask “when did you choose to be straight?”  The blank stare while their brain melts is fantastic.
11,r/antitheistcheesecake
12,Thats the cringiest sub I’ve ever seen
