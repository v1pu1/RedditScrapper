1,"Wish I could get away with that as a creator.

""I am the perfect robotic engineer, I made this robot""

""But it shuts down randomly and shakes, and goes out of control""

""Oh, well I made all the good things about it. Just the randomness of nature in the world is what made it not work perfectly."""
2,"""Humankind and nature"" the stuff he also supposedly made. That argument is flawed."
3,God literally invented all the bad shit just as much as the good. Not only that but if ‚Äúgod is everywhere and in everything‚Äù that means he is all the bad things.
4,"It's like they never read the bible.

Isaiah 45:7

I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the LORD, do all these things."
5,"Is god the creator of all things in heaven and earth? Then he created mental illness in order for this person to get it.

Did god not create mental illness? Then who did? Who else is running around out there with the awesome power to create something out of nothing?

Either god gave you mental illness, in which case why would you pray to him to remove it? Or god is not the only super-being out there and somebody else overruled god and gave you mental illness, in which case why pray to him to fix it if somebody else is more powerful?

Or maybe, just maybe, god doesn't exist and we should allow people who are fighting mental and physical ailments to seek genuine care."
6,It's almost as if he doesn't exist.
7,"I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, partly because of the way I was treated growing up in a fundamentalist church. 

Don‚Äôt fit in? Spiritual sickness 

Depressed? I‚Äôm not right with god

Anxiety? You need to trust god

Excluded? Something is wrong with you

Neglected? You‚Äôre being blessed to bring you closer to god

Lonely? All you need is god

Suicidal? Spiritual sickness

Get sick easily? Spiritual sickness 

Terrible acne? By his stripes you will be healed

Want love? Look to god

We need unconditional love from each other to be healthy in any stage of life. The results of having this profoundly necessary loving support withheld is catastrophic and permanently damaging. 

The truest words ever spoken are that *there is no hate like Christian love.*"
8,God lost all his stock in big nature? How come I didn‚Äôt get a notification? Seems like a big deal. Fucking asshat
9,"Ah, the good ol' ""God made the good things, the bad things are your fault"" argument."
10,God talks to me! He tells me to kill women. I‚Äôve killed 5 so far. He rewards me with lights and music in my head.
11,Always makes me laugh how religious people think witchcraft is bad. When they literally believe in an all knowing being and they pray like a spell and perform rituals for it.
12,"He made everything. 
He knows everything. 
He has the power to do everything. 
And yet, he is not responsible for anything."
13,"He knew you would end up with it. Then why not stop it before it even started? I don't know about you but if I had a kid I wouldn't try everything in my power to end my kids suffering be it meds or whatever. God and just poof it gone. So God is a sadist then, good to know."
14,The just world fallacy is a hell of a drug
15,"Getting a 10 year old pregnant is God's plan, but when it would be your kid it would suddenly be the evil of mankind"
16,"*God can't stop rape and murder, because humans have free will!*

""Okay, so what about mental illness and cancer?""

*........*"
17,"""Have you talked to god?""  
""Yes, that's the mental illness!"""
18,"Prayers are basically manifestations. Speaking prayers. Speaking out loud and making words. Words that now existence on this timeline.

You know what else was spoken into existence? The Christian God. The Christians made it real (to them). Which means they created God. WHICH MEANS they are their own God."
19,"The Christian/biblical logic is that God is good. So he is not capable of ‚Äúnot good‚Äù. So for example, his inciting a war is considered good. And all the ‚Äúbad‚Äù stuff is a result of sin (separation from God)entering the world and ‚Äúmessing up‚Äù what was intended to be perfect (no war, sadness, pain, suffering etc.). 
Source: been in the church for a while and paid attention and asked questions in Bible study haha

üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí® yeah it‚Äôs hard to wrap your head around it. Like many comments already pointed out, seems like a cop out to only take credit for the good and be blameless for the bad. Just wanted to provide some context for anyone who‚Äôs curious!"
20,My response would‚Äôve been ‚Äúwell who created humans and nature?‚Äù
21,God's sad he made you're brain bad so he conceived his followers to gaslight you for him.
22,The attempt to hide usernames
23,"What a ridiculous idea. If I sent my child somewhere knowing they would be, let‚Äôs say, assaulted and beaten. If I knew that would happen, and still SENT them there, I would hold a huge amount of responsibility for that."
24,Nature? You mean creation? You mean God?
25,"""God created everything and everyone, he CREATED YOU AND YOU BELONG TO HIM""

""Oh ok so it's his fault I'm this fucked up""

""No that's human nature"""
26,"No, he doesn't ""give"" you bad things, it's just that the omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent being won't lift his divine finger to do anything about it. Sorry, I guess I should cross out one of those three omni- words, but I can't tell if he's evil, ignorant, or powerless yet."
27,This is why it's better to pray to Joe Pesci.
28,"So god isn't the creator of anything, he's just a casual observer who doesn't really interact in any meaningful capacity. But he still exists, trust me"
29,"This ain‚Äôt gonna end, be a survivor of the incoming nukes telling people god brought the rains or some shit."
30,All i get from this is that god fucking hates humans
31,"Selective blame? Yeah, that‚Äôs sounds like a conservative Christian thing."
32,Testing tesying
33,"Praying and believing in a god isn't bad on it's own. Sure you'll end up feeling a bit betrayed or you'll keep lying to yourself, but so long as you don't bother other people with it, have fun, enjoy, pray away"
34,"I have minor respect for the fact she didn‚Äôt outright deny its existence, the bars low."
35,"The Pelagian asks *(begs)* the question

The Origenic states the obvious

and The Calvinist showed up at the end to tie this little shitshow into a nice bow"
36,"I almost want to side with the Christian here. It's just that ""humankind and nature"" is a funny way to spell ""capitalism"".

Not all mental illness is caused by capitalism, of course. But it certainly isn't helping between the constant stress of feeling like you won't make ends meet, the perpetual depression that you aren't achieving enough, and also can't afford to seek proper therapy and Healthcare.

Oh. And the crushing loneliness of conforming into a system of perpetual competition."
37,"So, god knew you were gonna have clinical depression. He had the power to stop it. Yet he didn‚Äôt. Even if his is almighty that means that he‚Äôs not all loving. And you can‚Äôt blame this on free will because this wasn‚Äôt caused by anything else."
38,"So he doesn't give people major depressive disorder, which is genetic?"
39,The mental gymnastics these people go through is ridiculous. How do they not see it??
40,"It sure would be nice if Christians would be honest about what's in their holy book, or you know, even bother to read it."
41,It‚Äôs worse than that. ‚Äúgod‚Äù created mental illness itself; he had the power to choose otherwise.
42,Who designed humankind and nature? and has the power to change both? God. Checkmate.
43,you can‚Äôt say my skydaddy did a bad üò† cloudpapa created everything but the bad stuff is your fault üòá
44,"The author of reality, just not the ""bad stuff""...got it."
45,"I'm gonna be my manager for 2 seconds here..
Me : so you knew this would happen? What the fuck have you done about it? Darn it Harold! Considering how irresponsible you are, your next review is not looking so good."
46,"God did give us ticks though. One of the most destructive insects known to man and also one of the most useless. 

Why would God make ticks? They have almost no natural predators, are poisonous and survive souly on the blood of their host. What kind of benevolent kind being would make a fucking tick."
47,"I took a class called ""crisis intervention"". Basically how to deal with people in a mental health crisis from a first responder standpoint.

There was one guy in there who kept insisting that mental illness was entirely related to people's relationship with God. Basically if it was poor, they could easily improve their illness by strengthening their relationship with God.

Shit really pissed me off. Guy worked security in a hospital, he should know better than to spout that nonsense."
48,I wonder if god knows the exact date I‚Äôll kill myself or if that‚Äôs up to nature
49,So what you're saying is that Isaac Asimov's robots are more moral than God?
50,"It‚Äôs the Epicurean Paradox in action.  God is good but also created debilitating mental problems, but also God didn‚Äôt create those and can‚Äôt fix them, but God is all powerful and created everything and should be worshipped, and if people don‚Äôt want to worship a God who created debilitating mental conditions, they‚Äôre evil and should go to hell."
51,"‚ÄúNothing bad comes from him!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd the devil and sin come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúReeeeeeeeeeligious persecution!‚Äù"
52,The ideal being for some people is weirdly all powerful and not responsible for anything.
53,"Human kind and nature‚Ä¶

The same god that predestined people to act accordingly to ‚Äúhis plan‚Äù, good or bad; knows everything we are going to do (omniscient) but still lies about ‚Äúfree will‚Äù; changes the rules constantly according to ‚Äúhis will‚Äù; and suddenly, when you have no choices left to make because of his arbitrary rules, makes you the bad guy because you still had ‚Äúgood choices‚Äù. Some god‚Ä¶"
54,But god created every single thing.
55,"Your god seems rather useless , can‚Äôt control anything, can‚Äôt fix anything and can‚Äôt keep control of his staff, such as Lucifer, what a looser"
56,"Isaiah 45:7

I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things."
57,"Didn't really hide the usernames here, did ya?"
58,"Uncle Ben in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie: ""With great power comes great responsibility""

Fundies: ""With great power comes the ability to do nothing or actively harm others and pretend I'm a good person"""
59,According to the Omnis of Christianity it was indeed God's plan and intention to give her depression and he knew all about it.
60,God killed everyone in a huge flood and is an asshole
61,bad things don‚Äôt come from god but he knows when bad things will happen and doesn‚Äôt stop it. So what the hell does he do?
62,Nothing bad comes from him?   Just the gift of cancer for kids.  And lets not forget his priests giving those kids the gift of dick. And they don‚Äôt even say thank you.
63,Those are the same justifications you would make for an abuser
64,"God is either the prime mover and responsible for everything, or he‚Äôs not god."
65,Guess she didn‚Äôt read Isaiah.
66,Oh a man in a fancy dress stands behind a podium and says god spoke to him and everyone loves it but if I started saying god spoke to me they tell me to fuck off.
67,I didn't know god was so weak.
68,"‚ÄúI form the light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil; I, the Lord, do all these things.‚Äù (Isaiah 45:7)"
69,"I never understood how they reconcile the concept of a benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent god. You can't know how evil and shitty the world will end up (because he created it that way) and claim you're a good guy."
70,"‚ÄúNothing bad comes from him‚Äù

*murdered millions in the bible*"
71,"Hello? 911? Yes, I'm calling because somebody just crashed into a brick wall at 60 miles per hour.

But seriously, even experienced theologians struggle to come up with satisfactory answers to the problem of evil, and this Joe Schmo thinks that *his* ""solution"" is viable? LMFAO."
72,"C.S. Lewis literally claims the opposite in Mere Christianity, stating that God gives some people greater challenges than others, and rewards them proportionally in the afterlife.

Christians are fucking stupid."
73,"‚ÄúNothing bad comes from him‚Äù

God: [how bad can I be?](https://youtu.be/BXlYuaycRbU)"
74,"Then where do humankind or nature come from, you deluded automaton?"
75,TikTok is FILLED with religious fruitcakes that say the same thing
76,Quick question who created humankind and nature ü§î
77,"God sounds like an unavailable narcissistic father, who takes credit for all the positive things you do and refuses to take responsibility for all your shortcomings and mistakes, blaming it on literally everyone else, including you."
78,"The leap out of logic it's just... Argh! If someone subscribe to the notion that everything was being made by ""god"" then every bad thing comes from it."
79,It literally says he ‚Äúcreates evil‚Äù in his goddamned holy book.
80,"ALL on this earth, good and evil, is God‚Äôs will (Matthew 6:10).  
  
Proverbs 16:4 says, ‚ÄúThe LORD hath made all for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.‚Äù  
  
Revelation 17:17 says ‚ÄúGod hath put in their hearts to fulfill His will‚Äù and what He has the wicked do here ‚Äî give the world to Satan ‚Äî is evil.

‚Äú‚Ä¶shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?‚Äù \~Amos 3:6b"
81,I didn‚Äôt flood the town. That was the river. I just removed the dam.
82,"God; all knowing, all powerful but can't do anything about mental illness or disease. Also, wars? Mankind. Natural disaster? Nature, can't help you bro.

Someone stole your wallet with your rent money and you're going to get evicted? You can pray about it but God's only responsible for good things, sorry.  If you win the lottery or survive surgery, thank God though.

Faith; getting you through life as long as you read the fine print and disclaimers."
83,"All the goodness is God's doing, and all the badness is humanity's doing?

How convenient."
84,Well my family just told me that the reason my kid got Covid (he‚Äôs fine btw) is because we aren‚Äôt in church anymore. So there‚Äôs that.
85,The guy talking to God on the street corner already has mental illness and it doesn't seem to be helping him
86,"Interesting, suffering comes from the good gods‚Ä¶ it reminds us we do not belong to this world, but most people have no genuine knowledge of the spirit anymore, so I am not surprised to see these kinds of guesses"
87,"""God is almighty! But God doesn't do shit."""
88,Except for that bible verse where it explicitly says god created evil.....Isiah 45:7
89,"No no no, hear her out‚Ä¶the logic tracks."
90,"What a terrible use of logic. Traditional Christian theology is not doing its followers any favors.

One major part of this is whether the god created the universe from nothing (ex nihilo) or god made forms from the chaos. It might not sound like much, but it‚Äôs a big point. 

If god created the universe from nothing, then god created evil. However, if god created order from the chaos, which implies a dependent origination of the universe (meaning the Big Bang could be a recycling of a previous universe, or god created forms from elements that have always been present) which implies god can be in reality, and yet not have control over it. 

The alpha hasn‚Äôt been completely defined in the Judeo-Christian narrative yet and neither has the Omega (god doesn‚Äôt even know the oMega because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet)."
91,Let me heal you of your mental illness with another mental illness... gotta love the logic.
92,"""Nothing bad comes from him.""  What about those times in the bible where he actually tells people to kill babies and shit.  Or the times he actually rained down rocks on a city killing everyone.  Those are kinda on him, right?"
93,Babies born with horrible deformities or missing organs and due within hours or days after birth aren't god's fault either you guys.
94,God only does the good things.
95,"""God doesn't create anything bad"" explain child slavery, cancer, and harlequin babies"
96,"Nothing bad comes from him? How do they explain kids born with genetic anomalies, kids dying in the accidents, and so on"
97,"No yall misunderstanding this woman. Due to God giving man the gift of free will humans became vulnerable and powerful.

Because God already knows what's going to happen he knows what you will choose. The evil comes from the free will of humans. 

Read ya Bible"
98,"Tell an American you are struggling with mental health, and they are like, did you see a shrink?
Where do you people get the money for frivolous things without free healthcare?
Or is Reddit just the rich, liberal side of America?



God created man in his image, and he has been alone for an eternity. That is why we are all alone within ourselves and no one is truly able to fully understand another person, god gave us his condition :)"
99,Program errors are the will of the maker and part of his great plan. But if you pray with me hard enough and donate to my IT megachurch I can try to acquire a patch update
