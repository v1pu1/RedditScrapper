1,"The somewhat recent misuse of ""indoctrination"" by American Christian propagandists has made my username ambiguous when it wasn't originally."
2,Ah yes. A hallmark of religion. Close-mindedness
3,"It never occurs to these people that the ‚Äúrighteous‚Äú politicians they elect make it impossible for them to live securely on one income and keep their little bigots in training at home. 

My eldest lost friendships with some kids after they found out we weren‚Äôt churchy enough for their parents."
4,Why does she ahve a sword??
5,"The poor child, how is she ever going to cope with being indoctrinated into the real world?"
6,‚ÄúYour little warrior‚Äù seems to sum up the disfunction pretty clearly.
7,Fulfilling your persecution fetishes through your children 101
8,damn they put more effort into photoshopping that sword than they do into raising their kids
9,"I see a victim brainwashed that they are sonehow always being attacked, trained to disrupt classes to not only ruin their own education but that of all the students in their class, no doubt told that they need to proselytize to the classmates and basically bully them into a faith none of them understand cause they are children. 

Almost seems like we DO need to help heal them of the bootcamp they were just let out of."
10,"I don't think these fellows are sending children to a Jedi Academy, so why is there a lightsaber in the picture?"
11,"Well, at least she‚Äôll be popular! Soon as she steps on the bus, all the other kids will be saying, ‚ÄúWOW! COOL SWORD!‚Äù"
12,"Kid gets to school, and after being relieved of her weapon, discovers it's almost none of those things her kooky mommy worries about.  Begins to question kooky mommy's faith."
13,"Mom is wearing pants. Must be a lesbian.  

/s"
14,Parental-induced psychosis.
15,Its funny cuz religion is literal indoctrination.
16,"
Religion exists only because people indoctrinate their children before they are smart enough to resist."
17,"All this bullshit about being ""warriors"" because of the fantasy they believe in is so melodramatic."
18,"When blind obedience to existing dogma is your expectation for children, then of course education is viewed as ""indoctrination."""
19,"I still remember the day someone came into my Sunday School with ‚Äúimportant news‚Äù.  They handed out some bullshit article about a Christian explorer finding Noah‚Äôs Ark.

Even as an adult I meet people who believe this actually happened."
20,Why don‚Äôt they just go to a Christian school?
21,"""Master Anakin, my mother says the Earth is flat and vaccines cause autism.""

""This is where the fun begins"""
22,"Anti-indoctrination = ""indoctrination""

They're all projection, every accusation is a confession

I won't be tolerant of intolerance."
23,Just keep calm and remember we are just 1/2  a chromosome from a chimpanzee
24,The cringe is physical
25,Where the fuck was my lightsaber?!?!
26,"That looks an awwwffuull lot like a lightsaber, someone get the mouses legal team on the line."
27,I loved being your sacred weapon long thought to be forgotten and forged by the gods to vanquish all evils day
28,Pretty sure it‚Äôs the other way around
29,Whereas churches are where they send their kids to get them assaulted.
30,"Fundamentalists: ""Be strong honey. They're going to try to tell you that dinosaurs evolved from birds and lizards and things which evolved from fish and that the devil didn't bury their bones in the ground to fool us into believing the planet is really billions of years old, because that's the devil's big plan...to get us to believe the planet is older."""
31,Memes have completely fucked my sense of irony.  I still can't tell if this meme is serious or not.
32,*gives child a gun*
33,sucks that this is how my mom would‚Äôve seen me when i went into public school my freshman year of high school. i‚Äôm so embarrassed to say i wrote a slew of bible verses on my arms in marker the fIRST day of ninth grade because i was ‚Äúpreparing to go into battle for the lord‚Äù
34,If teachers could indoctrinate children they'd start with indoctrinating them to behave better. That your little Brayden and Brayleigh are still brats is clear and convincing evidence that no indoctrination is taking place
35,"The melodrama gets me. Calm down, your 5-year-old is going to be coloring with crayons and wiping their nose on their shirt like everyone else's."
36,The parents should probably pull themselves up by their bootstraps to send them to a private religious school instead of sending them to non religious public school.
37,Defining characteristic is overwhelmingly confident ignorance
38,Religious people don‚Äôt like public schools because it inhibits the parents indoctrination
39,The blade is glowing because there are gays and liberals nearby /s
40,Is she off to Star Wars camp? Because it looks like she is holding a Light Sabre.
41,"It's illegal to send your child to school with a weapon.

>Parental Accountability for School Violence

>Parents are often accountable for their child's actions. They may be responsible for a child's damages resulting from criminal actions such as vandalism. Schools have, at times, sued students for the damages their children are responsible for at school. Parents can also be criminally liable if they ""contributed to the delinquency of a minor."" An example of this occurs when a child brings a parent's firearm to school, particularly when the parent failed to store the firearm in accordance with state laws. More serious issues can also result in the removal of the child from an abusive home, supervised visitation, or parenting classes.

42,"So, send them to private school, why turn public school into your goofy religious crap‚Ä¶Goldwater was right, you just can‚Äôt reason with those people."
43,Keep your brat at home if you can‚Äôt handle it.
44,"Bad ass fucking picture lol, little girl is battle ready for reading circle this morning."
45,I'm betting that the child believes in the flat earth and the covid vaccine is the mark of the beast.
46,I was thinking of church tbh
47,Where/when did the whole schools are indoctrination camps thing start? I know a number of people that talk about it but at the same time give up once they realize the work that needs to be dedicated to it.
48,The scariest phrase here is ‚ÄúLittle Warrior‚Äù. Terrifying.
49,Is that sword to fight off the shooter
50,"A lot of American schools are used as indoctrination camps.

Salute the flag, verse the pledge of allegiance, dont use your brains, just obey etc."
51,Indoctrination camp? You mean like church camp?
52,"I notice all the people accusing schools of ""indoctrination"" are actually in favor of schools indoctrinating kids, as long as it's with *their* personal beliefs. 

Teaching about the Civil War or the Holocaust: **Indoctrination** 

Teaching kids racism does not and has not ever existed: Keeping kids from feeling sad about history

&#x200B;

Teaching kids there are multiple cultures and religions in the world: **Indoctrination**  

Making kids pray to a Christian God in schools, ignoring the separation of church and state: Ending school shootings

&#x200B;

Having books in school libraries that mention anything LGBTQI: **Indoctrination** 

Burning all the books that ""go against biblical teachings"": Saving children from becoming gay

&#x200B;

They describe what they want and don't understand that it is the literal definition of indoctrination."
53,"I mean technically they are indoctrination camps for unfettered free market capitalism, patriotism and American exceptionalism. The literal original purpose of public school was to prepare kids to work in factories and turn them into worker drones. Are we sure the original meme poster is religious?"
54,Momma‚Äôs little science denier
55,These fuckers think they‚Äôre living in the middle east or some shit.
56,Just one small problem. She is bringing a knife to a gun fight.
57,"I mean, some schools really do try to indoctrinate their students. Religious schools. The right doesn't know the difference between secular and atheist though, so they assume that a secular school is just an atheist religious school (i.e. teaching that atheism is correct, rather than just not teaching any answer to religious questions)."
58,Idk. That glowy sword looks like witchcraft.
59,Wait a second‚Ä¶I thought Evangelicals didn‚Äôt believe in science. How the hell did they start building light sabers?
60,We have hit peak cringe üò¨ lol.
61,That‚Äôs hilarious
62,cool sword
63,Did Jesus use a lightsabre?
64,She turned her daughter jnto king Arthur
65,"""Indoctrinating children is bad , that's why I did it first"" -Religious people probably"
66,"So cringey to see the Mom kneeling and putting her hand on her kid, it just seems weird the way its shown."
67,Such make believe.
68,Since when did Jesus Force get light sabres? I might still be a Christian if we had light sabres.
69,"""Unable"" to homeschool or to lazy and/or self-absorbed to do it?

Literally this what every (religious) homeschooler I've even known does: they buy a bunch of religious ""textbooks"", sit their kid down and say ""read this"" with no interaction whatsoever."
70,& their angel goes to school & gets involved in all of the forbidden things behind their back üòâ
71,"I still can‚Äôt figure out as a teacher who and what I am indoctrinating my students in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Ummm be polite, study, do your best, get your work done, etc. Pretty sure those are all good things."
72,When you indoctrinate your child because you're convinced by politicians that school is trying to indoctrinate them.
73,Fucking cringe
74,Seems like her house is on fire but that also makes sense as these vacuoles only worry about everyone else without doing a damn thing to improve themselves‚Ä¶.
75,Nothing is worse than a school that will teach the kids facts instead of fundie misinformation.
76,"having been a public school teacher for the better part of 20 years (and in a blue state!) i can promise you that there is precious little time for basic instruction, nevermind ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù. we‚Äôre all struggling to meet the minimum standards for instruction and not once in all those years did any of us feel like we adequately covered all the material for our grade. the only ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù taking place is in the minds of these people because of the news, friends, and social media they choose to listen to."
77,Schools are more of a shooting range than an indoctrination camp.
78,Cool I want a lightsaber
79,I think mother might have some Orc in her by the look of that elven blade.
80,Legend of Karen: Breath of the Manager
81,"‚ÄúPut your sword back in its place,‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚Äúfor all who live by the sword will die by the sword.""
-Matthew 26:52"
82,Oh I thought he meant Bible camp
83,"That sword is glowing blue. That place has got to be crawling with orcs and goblins. Don't just kneel there, lady! DO SOMETHING!"
84,Do they suppose she'll be allowed to take that sword with her on the bus?
85,Pro parenting tip: don't give your children real light sabers
86,If you felt that strongly you would not send them.
87,She will be ok at Jedi camp as long as Anakin isn't the instructor.
88,Pretty sure lightsabers would be classified as a weapon
89,Projection again. Look at Florida.
90,"‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre telling me I get to go to indoctrination camp with a Lightsaber? Count me in!‚Äù"
91,Few people I respect less thank homeschoolers.  Setting up your kid to be a weirdo with few friends and a biased education to stroke your ego. A fellow girl scout mom told me she pulled her four kids out to homeschool because ‚ÄúI always wanted to be a teacher.‚Äù  I honestly said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you have a degree in teaching.‚Äù Facepalm.  Of course she doesn‚Äôt have a degree.  She never spoke to me again. üëç Win for me.
92,Sending her kid to a gun fight with a sword
93,Homeschooling is the very definition of indoctrination. I would know.
94,I wonder if the sword is glowing because there is an orc nearby
95,"If you have keep your child at home to keep them from questioning your worldview you've forced on them, those views aren't worth keeping."
96,The little girl later went on a killing spree before being gunned down by a SWAT team after a 3 hour standoff. 34 lives were lost that day
97,"Ha! My parents didn‚Äôt trust me to be able to be strong in the faith, so they sent me to Christ private schools. Guess what happened to my faith anyway?"
98,Peak cringe
99,"Indoctrination to be a xenophobic consumer, yes"
100,Lmfao ü§£
