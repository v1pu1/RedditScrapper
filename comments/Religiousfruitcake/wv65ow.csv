11,"I'd never treat my girlfriend like this. She's my favorite person and she's dealt with a lot throughout her life. If I ever asked her to do anything similar to this she'd leave and be right to do so.   

People that think this way are part of the problem not the solution. The bible isn't a good basis for morals, ethics or  anything in my mind.   The minute your personal beliefs or choices begin impacting someone else in a negative way.  You need to stop and reconsider.

For example voting for a right wing politician that's anti abortion. While yes it is a personal choice to vote for them. This person being elected potentially allows for bills restricting abortion to get passed more easily. By voting that person in you have just impacted millions of people in your state even if you didn't think about it. But then again that would take some insight and intelligence which is lacking in a good number of people throughout the US."
12,Fuck the Bible

19,"Imagine a woman holding a sign that said, ""men should give us all their money,   wear manly clothes, take out the trash, and stay quiet, ect..""

How would that go over?

Why do we tolerate this from men?"

28,The real scary is that a lot of Christian women have been indoctrinated to believe all of this! They are actually celebrating the withering of women's rights by ChristoFascists and don't see anything wrong with it. And yet they have the audacity to scream about everyone else being groomers and manipulators!
29,Thatâ€™s homophobic ðŸ’€
