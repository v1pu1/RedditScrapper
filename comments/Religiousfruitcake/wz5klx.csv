1,"The third commandment is my favourite 

>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

God's loving and benevolence toward his creation is clear for all to see."
2,"No, I won't be begging your imaginary friend for anything. Just as useful to beg Gandalf or Harry Potter."
3,These old fucks are so cringey with that religious bullshit.
4,"The Satanic Temple has better ones:

THERE ARE SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL TENETS  
I  
One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.  
II  
The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.  
III  
One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.  
IV  
The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.  
V  
Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.  
VI  
People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.  
VII  
Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word."
5,"They forgot the other 603 commandments in the Bible that their god supposedly gave.

Also, funny. I thought we could repent to Jesus at any time. Oh wait. That’s just Christianity trying to be the NWO, isn’t it?"
6,"This is why pagan gods are best if you believe in religion, especially Norse and Greek gods. You make deals with them, offer them a sacrifice, if they decide that your wish is good, they’ll give it to you, then only you’re obligated to worship them."
7,"The best system of ethics makes room to demand to keep the Sabbath holy, yet forgot to mention thou shalt not diddle kiddies.

Best system of ethics available!!!"
8,No it isn't.  It depicts God as jealous and petty.  It invites you to treat a wife as property
9,"Imagine believing a guy from the middle east 2000 years ago is going to sace the entire world from destruction.
Shits crazy, feels like an episode from The Orville."
10,"Bruh, that reply at the bottom has big threat energy."
11,"If god is real, which I seriously doubt he is, I'd rather go to hell with a clear concious as a good man that god has failed than beg him for mercy and sing his praises. If he's real, he's one evil motherfucker"
12,"There are 3 sets of the 10 commandments in the Bible. 2 of them are pretty much the same. The other one was given as the official 10 commandments, and has several more added at the end, so people still argue about how to merge them into 10. And the fun thing is that it doesn't exactly match the common ones.  
  
The two that are regularly called the 10 commandments basically go like this:  
  
First 4 are all about God, not really any ethical/moral guidance;  
  
1. Worship the Jewish/Christian God, don't worship any of the others.  
  
2. Don’t make any graven images of God (or any of the others)  
  
3. Don’t take the name of God in vain  
  
4. Observe the Sabbath, Keep it Holy  
  
The Last 5 have something to do with ethics or morality, but some are a bit dubious.

  
5. Honor your father and mother, and you'll have a long life.  (Will you?)  
  
6. Don’t kill. (A solid ethical command, but no exceptions written, but dozens of exceptions in the bible, and necessary exceptions in real life, so it falls flat as written.)  
  
7. Don’t commit adultery (marrying a person who has been divorced counts as adultery.  But it's an ethical commandment.)  
  
8. Don’t steal (A solid ethical command.)  
  
9. Don’t perjure yourself against your neighbor. (Your neighbor in the context given, would be other Jews.  It's a good start, but it's way too narrow.)  
  
10. Don’t covet other people’s possessions (including, um, their wives and slaves). (Nothing ethical here, but it is a moral guideline.  I think it's good advice, but it's about what you think and feel, not really an action.)"
13,"If they choose to believe those things, good for them. But, I do believe between the same front and back cover, they would find admonishments about pushing God's Word onto others and bringing God's Word into contention. Maybe people need a refresher on what ""Do not cast thy pearls before swine or thy sacred things to dogs"" means. That is not a suggestion, it's a directive. Most of todays Christians seem more like modern-day Pharisees, then followers of Christ. It's funny how many Christians never acknowledge their own responsibilities with regards to the Word of God, but want to push their ""limited"" moral view on people, who were given the freedom to choose their own path, including that which leads away from Scripture,  by that very same God. Seems just a little hypocritical, from over here."
14,"Ah, the Ten Commandments: A set of laws so perfect, it forbids making statues and boiling baby goats in milk, but doesn't mention rape once."
15,"So they admit they want to base their morals on almost 4000 year old ancient laws from a Babylonian pagan tyrant named Hammurabi?

Seems really ""Christian"" to me . . ."
16,"The Ten Commandments means no First Amendment Right to freedom of religion, which many conservatives claim to love. The first commandment says that no other god should be put before Yahweh/Jehovah. It also says to remember The Sabbath and to keep The Sabbath (*The 7th Day/Saturday*). The Ten Commandments were written for The Children of Israel according to the bible, and the rules are mostly Jewish, rather than Christian, but I don't think they care. They'll probably twist it to make it seem christian because they are delusional.


Also, if the Ten Commandments were law, almost all christian artwork would have to be removed from society since it breaks the 2nd commandment about not making images of so-called heavenly things:

> ""*Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:*"""
17,Whackadoddles united in Jesus.
18,"""Every knee, blah blah blah..."" So much for that free will you guys like to blame for everything."
19,"The 10 Commandments (especially the social ones) are a good set of ethics, but unfortunately the people who tend to scream for them the loudest don’t seem to follow them.  Plus, these are the basic precepts of just about every religion, yet the evangelicals appear to want to force everybody to follow their form of them."
20,"""One day you'll be begging Ahura Mazda to drive out the darkness and give you wisdom.""

If you're not worried about Ahura Mazda then you already understand exactly what I mean, whether you want to or not."
21,"I wish there was a 5 minute period where, after these freaks died, they entered a giant dark room where you could see a small desk in the distance with a light shining on it. On the desk there would be a sign 🪧 saying, ""This is the end. You will shut off now. You were wrong."" and a guest book so they could sign their name and leave a not for the next fruit cake to read."
22,"One should not be begging an apparently loving, omniscient presence for salvation. If you are supposed to do good by your God and your religion, then why would your deity require you to beg for their forgiveness? Wouldn't living a pious and righteous life be penance enough?"
23,"Their god tells them ""I love you so much I'm going to burn you alive forever if you don't love me back.""

So when they're OK with killing you if you don't love their god, they're pretty much on point."
24,You mean like Handmaids Tale?
25,I love how it doesn't take long for these religious types to revel in others destruction for not seeing things the same way as them
26,"These folks are gonna be real upset when they die and realize, ""Oh fuck, there's actually nothing after death,"" before their cerebral cortex finally stops firing."
27,Under His eye…
28,"Because as every Christian definitely knows, God never forgives anyone ever and never will."
29,"Maybe this is wrong but I always argue that separation of church and state were a fundamental piece of our founding documents. Colonists left because of religious oppression by a state religion! So wanting one religion and that one religion to be forced on everyone isn’t very American. 

ALSO do you want religious police!? Because what you’re doing is how we get religious police! I’ll leave my country if we don’t start driving a wedge between church and state.
***edit I’ll fight harder to drive the wedge between church and state. I’m not going anywhere because that will only give them more power and we’ve worked too hard and we’re too close being greater than we ever were.

Time to tax them!!!
TAX THE CHURCHES!!!"
30,"Clearly not every knee or every tongue. Does ""every"" have a different meaning for them?"
31,[Mandatory George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE8ooMBIyC8)
32,# or else what?
33,I personally welcome the day there is proof of this. I will be the first to say o am wrong. Till then i wait willing to be convinced.
34,"Cool. I want to see what happens. Look, ma'am, you even get my explicit permission to whip or otherwise torture me or laugh at me begging as I stand before your God - if we truly end up there. Until then, not your damn problem."
35,"There aren't Ten Commandments; *there are only Two Commandments*.

George Carlin said so:

36,"Too bad it stole all their ideas from the Hammurabi code. To talk about ethics, eh…"
37,"To be fair, jesus sounds like he would be a kind ruler (I never read the bible, but from what I've heard he was a lovely guy. Unlike a lot of his followers)

However, his community is pretty toxic"
38,Jesus loves brown nosers
39,Under his eye
40,"Practically zero original thinking here. It’ll be a civil war, watch. 
I’m atheist, I don’t care and they’re christians, they care too much.
One day they’ll care more than I don’t, and it’ll be a problem for them."
41,"Get rid of one of the commandments where god tells everyone to suck his dick, and replace it with a commandment telling people not to rape or keep slaves. There, I've created a system of ethics which is superior to the ten commandments."
42,Religion is mental illness.
43,"They are out there, people, and they want to control you.

Your VOTE counts!"
44,No I won’t bow to your made up crap
45,RIMMERS FOR JESUS!
46,"I'd literally rather die, thanks."
47,"Yeah c’mon guys, if people want to murder, lie, and cheat, they should be able to!!1!"
48,Fookin' kneelers
49,"If you think it's more important to not work Sundays, not have an image of someone in heaven (better rip up those photos of your dead gran) and not thinking your neighbours new windows look nice than it is to avoid rape and keeping slaves you probably have a few issues."
50,"No, no I don’t think I will."
51,I'd prefer if people mentioned that number of 10 commandments are unconstutitional.
52,Does it hold people who've had their legs amputated or those who sinned against a Mexican cartel and had their tongues amputated?
53,It’s pretty amazing how bad the Ten Commandments actually are - the first five are just about god being jealous and telling you to be subservient. Only #6 and on has ANYTHING to do with actual morality.
54,[The Inquisition (Mel Brooks)](https://youtu.be/LnF1OtP2Svk)
55,I particularly like the commandment that can convict us of thought crime and the one that equates human women to chattel.  Nice job god
56,"As Brendon Burns says, the first five commandments are just marketing."
57,Where to begin?
58,"I believe only two commandments are constitutionally valid and have secular support, no murder and no stealing. The others are either purely religious or unenforceable"
59,"Jesus is lord ISN'T A COMPLETE SENTENCE. These people, I swear to Satan..."
60,Lord? Isn't Jesus a Brazilian player for Arsenal?
61,I'm sure that His ego won't be assuaged even after every knee has bent and every tongue has ... Licked?
62,"Well, a lot of them do have bowed knees."
63,Knees bow?
64,"First I have to ask which set of ten comandments (they don't know that there are more than one) second I have to say that the first amendment to the constitution in the US (which is where this post most likely came from) contradicts the first comandment (of the set they know). Third, I have to stress that five of the comandments talk about worshipping only that one god  but nothing about slavery. The extended rules in later chapters talk about how to treat slaves so slavery should be legal? The comandment about children obeying their parents so their days will be long upon the earth only says that because it was legal to KILL disobedient children should that STILL be allowed? Oh and If that's the old laws but Jesus ""got rid of the old laws"" then why follow them at all but second and more importantly Jesus supposedly said, ""not one Jot or Tittle of the old laws would pass away"" which means you should be doing all of this AND more barbaric stuff like sexual slavery and bride pricing and murdering people for stupid reasons."
65,Kinky.
66,Their version of a shitty God with low self-esteem sucks.
67,For a second I thought the 3rd poster was being kinky.
68,"There’s like four commandments revolving around sparing God’s ego and not a single one against rape, slavery, child abuse, etc."
69,Psychos
70,Do you need to censor names on this sub
71,How does this sound completely sane and rational to so many people?
72,"So it's been a while, but wasn't one of the core things with Jesus that it's never too late to repent? 

Or am i making the mistake of actually knowing what's in the bible more than the fruitcakes"
73,"There's no way these ppl believe this shit, and if they do hell is fucking overflowing. That would explain some shit though."
74,"oh yea, you want her to bow down and use that tongue alright, and it has nothing to do with god"
75,"Thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not commit adultery. And if you commit adultery, you will be killed."
76,I’ve only been to a handful of Catholic Church services but even I know that it’s never to late to repent. You can do it on your deathbed and god will let you into heaven.
77,Frrrreeeeeeeaks.
78,"You'd think the best system of ethics would mention something about not abusing children or taking other human beings as slaves.

Weird move god."
79,"dont know which is more galling - their absolute certainty in their delusions, their utter arrogance, or their blood thirsty schadenfreude

let's call it a 3 way tie, kinda like their 3-in-1 coffemate deity"
80,Wow. These people aren’t hiding it anymore.
81,Lmao the 7 tenets are a much better way to live if you're gonna go by a religion.
82,I'll bend a metal pipe across their skull before I bend a knee.
83,"The ten commandments are not even a good system of ethics. Don't lie, Don't steal, Don't murder people, and don't commit adultery are pretty much gimmies. Honor your father and mother? That's not ethical because it implies that you don't need to honor other people, as well as implying that mothers and fathers should be honored whether they are ethical themselves or not. The first few (depending on how you slice them) are just about not having other gods, which I wouldn't suggest has anything to do with ethics. And the last few (depending how you slice them) have to do with coveting, which doesn't strike me as a question of ethics. (I would think the ethical part is covered in 'thou shalt not steal' which suggest that you shouldn't steal things even if you really covet them'. I would suggest that Jesus's summary ""do unto others as you would have them do to you"" is far superior, as is ""All I ever needed to know I learned in Kindergarten""."
84,I think I just pulled an eye muscle...
85,"Best system of ethics, huh? So what now, is the US going to seriously consider killing every security guard, cashier, waiter, cabbie, everyone who works on the Sabbath day?

This is Exodus 35: 2  
2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

So what now? It is best, but inconvenient, therefore you guys close your eyes to it?"
86,"Wanna watch people like this fight one another? Ask them if they think (or in their words ""know"") that the Rapture will happen before or after the Tribulation, what that means. They really argue about that.

(Note: does not apply to Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, or Lutheran fruitcakes, since these denominations do not believe in the rapture.)"
87,"""I don't believe in your religion""

""Here let me convince you of it's reality by threatening you from it's book of claims."""
88,"Religion is a cancer.. being atheist does not mean you're immoral. Being a Psychopath makes you immoral.. And trust me, I've seen some religious people who are sick minded."
89,"Religious people aren't able to debate anything. They just ignore things they have no argument for.

But what we see here is pretty standard stupid. Fear, propaganda, and a total void of intellect. Yeah that'll convert people alright, threatening is always great right?"
90,"I thought they were against pedophilia? Not even mentioned, nor is rape. 30% of the commandments are taken up just demanding religiosity"
91,"Someone please cut off my legs and cut out my tongue. Would rather that than bending a knee and saying bullshit like Christ is lord, ugh just typing that makes me feel dirty

I’d rather stuff my colon with gun powder and fart over an open flame

I’d rather spend eternity with Satan shoving pineapples up my anus 

I’d rather spend an hour in the same room as Andy dick"
92,"Yup, it you follow them then you see good by religious standards.  

I forget, which one says that raping children is not ok?"
93,"Wow, they really equate Jesus to God, huh? Even though, at most, he is son of god. This is both concerning and entertaining."
94,One day you will die and your belief will be for nothing
95,[removed]
96,I’m gonna give him the benefit ofthe doubt and assume he means the final judgement
97,God putting out some real r/niceguys energy
98,Love me or I am gonna create problems for you.
99,"It makes a lot more sense if you lived in a small, unscientific civilization thousands of years ago and nobody can read or write."
100,"That sins of the fathers things, you would think would be problematic to Christians as it is means the innocent babies  suffer for something they didn't do. Where is the love and forgiveness in that?

And there is this of course;

“The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father…” — Ezekiel 18:20

But most Christians I have met seem to struggle to even recite the full 10, much less try and live their lives trying to follow them"
