1,They is exactly how they think.
2,"I'm American, but lived in Australia in 4th and 5th grade, which for me was in the '80s and went to public school there.  Every Wednesday there was a class based on peoples religions.  It was right after the recess period and everybody would line up by religion to go to their respective classes.  There were like 15 lines.  My parents were agnostic, so I had no idea where to go, and I was new to the school and had never seen anything like it.  So, I would just jump into a line where I recognized a face.   The whole thing was so weird for me.  I couldn't quite figure out what was going on and ended up going to a different line each week.  They all just sounded crazy to me.  The teachers all said things with an air of certainty, but none of it made any sense to me.  I had no context or history with any of it, so it just seemed really foreign to me.  Now, I have an appreciation of the fact that they made accommodations for different religions, but I kind of feel like I should have just been able to have more recess while the religious fruitcakes went off to their crazy classes."
3,I'd much rather hang with Gus than a conservative Christian Nat-C. And I've seen what the man can do with a box cutter.
4,"Hail, Satan!"
5,"In my school, you were forced to pray if you were a Muslim and were punished if you refused to do so. Keep in mind this was a classy international school too. 

I always avoided them anyway by just locking myself up in the bathroom lmao"
6,We want freedom **from** religion.
7,"Yeah not just Murica, this was a massive problem in Scotland too. It still is to a slightly lesser extent."
8,Same RW thinking everywhere. Applies to India without changing an iota.
9,"These people exist irl, and that's the scary part. Anything that isn't hardcore tradcon christianity is labeled as ""degeneracy"" or ""communism"" by these numbskulls."
10,"I just watched the Breaking Bad season 4 finale for the first time (I know, I‚Äôm late) and now I will forever see this man as Gus Fring"
11,"*Socially pressuring schoolchildren to pray to the god of a single faith, else they will burn in a fiery hell for all eternity üòÑso wholesome!"
12,But thats not communism
13,Communism isn't any better
14,they mixed up the top text
15,"Your gods have all the time you want evenings and weekends. School should be for learning, not churching"
16,">Christian Nat-C

Christian Nationalist Christian huh?"
17,"Our school had a daily prayer but they were ‚Äòsecular‚Äô

Now i know theres no such thing as a secular prayer

They just assumed you were one of like 5 religions"
18,That's the point. They think it IS. Fruitcakes!
19,"Do you even know what communism is?

Like the philospophy behind it, and the goals of the proposed economic system?"
20,"Dont think the meme is promoting communism, on the contrary it seems to be downplaying it"
21,##üí©
22,The less popular cousin of nat geo
23,Yes. In those days wearing a hijab or a *rudraksha* or a cross to school wasn't antinational either. That is why everyone participated in saraswati poojan.
24,"The goals are good, the problem is that any attempt to properly implement them runs into the brick wall of *basic human nature*."
25,Tens of millions starved and killed within a half a century doesn't sound too swell.
26,I live under a communist government.
27,"No, it's not promoting communism, it's pointing out how, in many people's minds, communism is basically just ""anything I don't like"".

The shadow of McCarthyism still lingers darkly across America."
28,"Ah I see, I didn't mean it was promoting it. Just said it isn't great and look at the downvotes."
29,"Oh i agree, but mindlessly claiming communism is bad for the sake of it is stupid, the idea isnt bad, just unrealistic"
30,"That is horrible.

I'm wondering how many people have been killed or starved across the world due to the actions of American ""Christian"" capitalism?"
31,Just say no.
32,"They will unironically say ""not real communism!!"". These idiots are as much fruitcakes as the religious nuts."
33,Elaborate
34,That fact that so many commenters are missing this point is telling.
35,Yeah thats what i felt too
36,I guess you got downvoted because it was unrelated to say communism bad
37,‚Ä¶Isn't that what I just said?
38,Those people were brown so they don't count.
39,"Sure, send me numbers and let's make a comparison."
40,"How much of that can be attributed to intentional genocide like Holodomor or even general madness like in the Khmer Rouge?

Stupid ""capitalism is when there isn't a perfect utopia"" argument again."
41,"Because nowhere in the definition of communism does it mention any of that lol. 

Dictators taking advantage of a communist system and then twisting/changing it has happened, yes, but that is also no longer communism either. 

Feel free to drop an egg of wisdom here."
42,"Shamelessly trying to bring in skin colour, typical 'Murican hypocrite."
43,Do your own damn research lol.
44,"Ah yes, they weren't able to see the future when defining communism. Much justification. Such genius.

Communism can't be achieved without lobotomizing humanity."
45,‚Ä¶I think you missed the unstated /s.
46,Whoosh
47,"Spoken like a typical anti-vaxxer.

As I say, commies are to economics what religious nutcases and anti-vaxxers are to science."
48,"Typically when you make claims, the burden of proof is on you to provide evidence.

I guess a commie fruitcake like you wouldn't know that."
49,"This. A thousand times this. Human nature is incompatible with communism. It'd work just fine for a eusocial species like bees or mole rats, but humans just don't think or behave like that."
50,Please explain what you mean by this. I don't quite follow.
51,">	Spoken like a typical anti-vaxxer.

Cool. I have 3 shots so, next insult please. Lol"
52,I wonder if they even browse this sub or are a part of a commie brigade.
53,Which is why I‚Äôm still waiting for the person I‚Äôm arguing with to put forward anything substantial to argue against. Will likely be here all week.
54,"Have you not argued with anti-vaxxers and COVID deniers who use the phrase ""do your own research""?"
55,"Idiot, can you not see that I'm drawing parallels?"
56,"Lol I like that you‚Äôre equating two completely different things just because some people believe in both. Nice straw man. I‚Äôm not religious, and I have opinions on communism that aren‚Äôt automatically ‚ÄúLOL you‚Äôre stupid for thinking about it at all, commie‚Äù."
57,"Sure

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Communism-Killed-Some-100-Million-People_fig1_324755193

Your turn."
58,"No I have not. Only seen comments like that online. I was confused by the comparison. Anti-vaxxers I'm familiar with but it feels to me like you're using ""commie"" as a slur and I'm not sure if you're using it factually (actual communist) or emotionally. I thought you equalled the two in ideology and convictions and I couldn't wrap my head around it. But now it just seems like snark. Nvm."
59,"Settle down, Dwight."
60,"No, I'm pointing out behavioral similarities between science-denying anti-vaxxers and economics denying commies."
61,"Oh so we‚Äôre just putting sketchy websites and assuming their stats are correct?

https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/965740/why-im-a-communist-and-why-you-should-be-too/amp/"
62,"No, I really mean that communists are as misinformed about economics as anti-vaxxers are about medicine."
63,Can‚Äôt wait to see your thesis!
64,Lmao shifting the goalposts I see. How about try refuting the sources and respond instead of poisoning the well.
65,"Lol, you commies link to random opinion articles from third rate gazette websites and then call researchgate ""sketchy"".

Astounding genius."
66,Why do you think that? (Honest question)
67,"It'll be on math, and not for the consumption of idiots like yourself."
68,"That‚Äôs not what ‚Äúshifting the goalposts‚Äù means, but, play the victim, I guess? Lol."
69,Woosh. Literally making fun of it in the very sentence it‚Äôs posted in. Take a joke more seriously lol.
70,No economist worth their salt acknowledges the labour theory of value as sensible or thinks that complete centralized planning of economies can work.
71,"Lol keep acting like you have people completely figured out from a Reddit comment, that‚Äôs totally a great source. God speed."
72,"Ah yes. The ""I was just joking"" defense, a common right-winger tactic. Lending further credibility to the ~~horseshoe~~ doughnut model."
73,"Alright, thanks for explaining your point. Much appreciated."
74,"I wasn't. Though certainly my Reddit comment allows you to figure out everything. Such psychic, much power."
75,"Sorry you couldn‚Äôt figure out something obvious lol. Keep patting your own back though, I guess."
76,"Do you even remember how this started? I‚Äôm not the one that made the original baseless claim with no articles/numbers, I called *them* out. And then I got called out for calling out, I think? It‚Äôs been a wild ride of nonsense so far lol."
77,"[This you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/ww5r4c/-/ilkbnts)

Want me to repeat everything?"
78,"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read it wrong or in the wrong order at this point. No need to repeat, I‚Äôm aware of what happened lol."
79,Whatever helps you sleep at night.
80,Communism sure help! Also: melatonin.
