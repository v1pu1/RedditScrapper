1,It's always Sunni in Kanyedelphia.
2,Fun fact since many people here are lgbt+ and their supporters. This Imam Ali guy is one of many mohammed's cousin and when was asked what is the right punishment for homosexuals? he said to burn them. So yeah fuck him.
3,Khanye
4,"Says to me "" i will decapitate people for not following 100% of MY rules"""
5,"""Religion of peace"""
6,"In fairness, diving headlong into the Sunni/Shia debate despite knowing nothing about it *does* seem like something Kanye would do."
7,Amazing. Four horrible people in one Twitter screenshot!
8,Isn’t that the China/Russia apologist
9,actual cannibal shia lebeouf?!?!?
10,"I come from a Sunni household. Therefore Hadiths are a big deal for us. I don’t know, if Shias take Hadiths seriously. 

There’s a Hadith about Ali, the companion of the prophet, burnt a few people for having lack of belief in God. How peaceful."
11,Sunni is cap
12,Sunni means dick in Tamil 💀💀💀
13,That guy now uses two victim cards
14,Sameera is seeing letters that are not in the tweet

18,"No, you got it completely wrong, Ali burned some apostates and Mohammad reprimanded him by saying fire/burning is the punishment of allah and should not be used"
19,Khaaaaaaaaaaaanye
20,I did that the other day but mostly to piss of a zealot rather than engage in actual debate. He said I'm not a real Muslim. I'm not a Muslim lmao
21,4?
22,Yeeee
23,"Now it's dark, and you seem to have lost him

But you're hopelessly lost yourself

Stranded with a murderer

You creep silently through the underbrush"
24,Shia means?
25,"And Ali's daughter was married to Abu Bakr when she was ""a little one"". No exact age is mentioned, but is generally assumed to be similar to Aisha's age at marriage: Less than 10 years old."
26,"You are thinking of a  different incident. 

The sources for the incident about Ali suggesting burning gay people which  was after mohammed's death

 الخرائطي في مساوئ الأخلاق (428)

ابن أبي الدنيا في ذم الملاهي (140)

الآجري في ذم اللواط ص:(29)

"" كتب خالد بن الوليد إلى أبي بكر الصديق رضي الله عنه، أنه وجد في بعض ضواحي العرب رجلا ينكح كما تنكح المرأة، وقامت عليه بذلك البينة، فاستشار أبو بكر رضي الله عنه في ذلك أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فكان أشدهم في ذلك قول علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه، قال: «إنَّ هذا ذنب لم تعص به أمة من الأمم إلا أمة واحدة، صنع الله تعالى بها ما علمتم، أرى أن نحرقه بالنار». فكتب أبو بكر رضي الله عنه عنه إلى خالد بن الوليد رضي الله عنه تحرقه بالنار، ثم حرقهم ابن الزبير رضي الله عنهما في زمانه بالنار، ثم حرقهم هشام بن عبد الملك، ثم حرقهم القسري بالعراق""

&#x200B;

my translation as short as possible : Khalid wrote to the first caliph abu bakr about a man who was getting fucked like women do. Abu bakr then consulted ali about the right punishment and he suggested burning them. Abu bakr then wrote to khalid and told him to burn the gay  man."
27,Kayyynyyhhaaa
28,"Shia, Ye, the commenter Sameera, and Allah or maybe Imam Ali?"
29,Shia isnt a word in tamil
30,"I see

Here is the hadith I talked about

Narrated `Ikrima:

Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn `Abbas who said, ""If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade it, saying, '**Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire)**.' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'""

31,Shia as in Shia LaBeouf? If so I'm out of the loop. Heard he's pretty chill.
32,So he burned zanadiqah and burned gays despite mohammad not a fan of such method.. Basically he was a psycho who loved to burn people alive.
33,"Seems unlikely since he was ordered into anger management by a judge.  But hey, maybe it worked.

Also, I have no idea if that's who Kanye was talking about, but it's my best guess."
34,"He was apparently abusive towards his ex, FKA Twigs."
35,He’s Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf
36,"He's had some drug problems and some emotional regulation issues, I think he has worked on them and mellowed a little, but who knows?"
37,"Well, he is Mohammad's cousin after all"
