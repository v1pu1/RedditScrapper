1,Was... Was that supposed to be a joke?
2,Did they just admit that the whole immaculate conception is just cope after Mary cheated on Joseph?
3,IVF or sperm donations exist.
4,Such low iq.
5,"Science: has no answer yet on what caused the big bang

Atheist: Fair enough. I won't try and insert my own ideas about what caused it until there's sufficient evidence.

Theist: Ohhh yOu AthEIsT thINk wE CamE frOM nOThiNG. mE Da sMArt yoU dA dUmB. cLEaRLy iT mUSt haVe BeeN gOd"
6,It's r/antitheistcheesecake btw.
7,When theists realize that they're the ones that believe somethings came from nothing all the time.
8,">oof good one

Yeah credit to any joke that discredits good ol mother Mary huh lol"
9,"How is God just like a regular man?

If you’re not on your knees, he’s not interested."
10,"They might not be able to find the Antichrist, but they're certainly mastering antihumor.

Though to be fair I do have to laugh since I think they're trying to make fun of their ""Atheists believe the universe came from nothing"" strawmen, but have actually just ended up making fun of Mary's explanation for her pregnancy."
11,"A massive pet peeve of mine is when a person employs an analogy that fundamentally can not apply to the real life situation. I noticed proselytizing theists are particularly fond of this.

 Here, they compare parents with god and the universe with the child. But those situations are utterly incomparable. We have seen all children come from parents. We haven’t seen any universe spring up from a god. Same applies that try to prove god using the watch and watchmaker analogy."
12, Ever heard of “ADOPTION”
13,"I'm surprised that no one has pointed out that infertility is not necessarily from birth nor permanent, nor does it mean someone *cannot* create a child. Infertility can occur after a certain age and can be treated or clear up on its own. Never again being able to have children is sterility. The man in question could very well have sired his child while or before becoming infertile.

""Infertility DOES NOT mean that a person can't conceive – it's just a bit more difficult. Sterility DOES mean that a person can't conceive, regardless of the medical or surgical intervention.""

A woman, for instance, can be temporarily infertile because of endometriosis."
14,"I didn't realise ""conceptio ex nihilo"" translates to ""I don't want to face facts."""
15,It’s sweet to see how hard they try.
16,*????*
17,"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… 

The atheist obviously must be Anakin"
18,Yes. On an anti-anti theist sub.
19,"Just for clarity, most people believe the immaculate conception has to do with Jesus. The Catholic dogma as codified is that the “immaculate conception” refers to the circumstances around the gestation and birth of his mother Mary. The “virgin birth” has to do with her conceiving and delivering the baby Jesus."
20,"I’m not sure because the message is really weird, as the first commenter states 

But the second commenter definitely did lmao"
21,"correction -

the immaculate conception is not the conception of Jesus. Instead, it is a theoretical event that states that the moment Mary was pregnant, she was absolved of all sins, past, present, and future

this is a Public Service Announcement"
22,Or other penises
23,"I don't understand how it's who made or caused the bing bang and not what caused the bing bang 

Why the fuck is it a he how did they make the connection that it has to be a being"
24,">Atheist: Fair enough. I won't try and insert my own ideas about what caused it until there's sufficient evidence.

Isn't that the approach of an agnostic? Atheist straight up says no God whereas agnostic is in the middle."
25,Haha sub is full of copium I like to browse all the terrible Facebook memes and redundant “arguments”
26,"You didn't need to hide the sub name, the icon gives it away as r/antitheistcheesecake"
27,"Lol. ""Yea they had premarital sex, but it was totally okay. God-ordained even. But only for them, just one time. If anyone else does it, you're Bad and Sinful.""

Baptists *absolutely* believe that God just... gave Mary a baby before she had any set at all.

I'm not sure which is wilder to me."
28,"I’m pretty sure it has nothing to do with Jesus, but the conception of Mary herself. That she was free from since since the beginning of her existence."
29,"Bro I checked out the sub, and it is *wild*. A bunch of people in denial and whinging that everyone is sick of their shit."

31,no.
