1,"i dOn't wAnT to HaVe tO sEnD yOu tO heLL wHeN yOu DiE.

Like an abusive spouse or parent - ""see what you made me do?""

It's almost as if the christian god was made up by immoral, bronze age cretins."
2,"""Then get rid of Hell entirely.  Why did you make it in the first place if you don't want anyone to go there?"""
3,"""I don't want you to get beaten up by your husband, so you better behave"", said the husband.

edit: I see I'm not the only one making the comparison with household violence.  
edit 2: Domestic violence! That was the term I was looking for, not ""household violence""."
4,So many scientists have been sent to hell so there must be aircon down there by now
5,I wish I had the confidence to dress like that.
6,"Hey, no worries dude. Hell doesn‚Äôt exist so there‚Äôs a zero percent chance of me going there. 

Unless of course you just mean Georgia in the summer. If so, I‚Äôve already been to Hell and back.

Edit: Change chance..."
7,"Hey, Jesus. If you don't want people to go to hell, then stop condemning them to hell. If you're the all-powerful God, you have the power to do that."
8,Then don‚Äôt condemn people to hell for victimless ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù
9,"Honestly, if being gay makes me go to hell then I can‚Äôt wait to be with people that actually give a fuck about me. If heaven is full of nothing but homophobes then I don‚Äôt wanna go to heaven."
10,"Hi Christians, I don‚Äôt want to brutally torture you and then murder you because of who you are.

But I will!

See how it sounds?"
11,God I always hate this logic. It‚Äôs the religious equivalent to getting smacked by a family member and them saying ‚Äúlook what you made me do!‚Äù
12,"Hell is such a stupid childish threat, it's hard to believe anyone falls for it, let alone over half the world, in some version."
13,I have to congratulate the guy who made that image because they didn‚Äôt make Jesus white
14,"So, like, don't send me there?"
15,"What I want to go to hell? Heaven sounds like prison. Eternity of nothing but on our knees, singing and worshiping some egotistical sadistic narcissist?"
16,"Imagine having the balls to call yourself a loving, merciful god when you're more than willing to condemn someone to an eternity of horrific pain and suffering all because they decided to love the 'wrong' person."
17,"The narrative doesn‚Äôt hold up unless god is the victim, which is impossible because this is the system he created. 

I love you, so do what I say or else I‚Äôll be forced to torture you for breaking rules I made up"
18,"Well, this is special. I mean. Couldn't the all powerful change the rules? The only difference between gay people and heterosexual people is their preferences, in this particular subject.

I don't thet this. Even if there was some God anywhere, this wouldn't make sense."
19,"Then don't. Get rid of hell. And none of that ""but they chose hell"" victim blaming bullshit. 

Even if my kids hated me and did terrible things to deliberately hurt me, if they were going to make a choice to harm themsleves, I would give my life to stop them from being harmed. I don't need them to grovel at my feet and demand they love me in order to protect and save them. Hence even I, a flawed human, is more moral and loving than this abusive, manipulative jesus bully."
20,Also hate forced hugs read body language
21,"You mean to tell me that most gays don‚Äôt walk around with rainbow, Mohawk hair, elf shaped ears, a pride flag just in case of spontaneous pride parades, & have a rainbow peace sign tattooed on their right arm??!!!  That complete news to me‚Ä¶."
22,I'd rather go to Hell because that's where all my friends will be. People who are certain they'll go to Heaven are dicks for the most part
23,Props to them for not using a white Jesus at least.
24,If he didn't want them to go to hell he could just close down hell or stop sending people there.
25,"""I have a really weird boner now."""
26,If loving people and existing will send me to hell then watch me burn with pride
27,"Explain that this omnipotent all loving god that loves us so much, yet if we don‚Äôt completely bend to his will, will torture us for eternity??"
28,"Yes. But props on not using Aryan Jesus, at least."
29,"My brother (in) Christ, you are the guy sending em there."
30,".1 Why did god make asexual reproduction ok for non human animals but condemn asexuality for humans?

.2 why is homosexuality found in nature if god condemned the practice of human homosexuality?, why are animals the exception?

.3  quote from the Bible: ‚ÄúThe woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy god‚Äù, so how exactly does god in his supposedly infinite wisdom determine what garment belongs to which sex in modern times? What is the difference between a skirt and a kilt?, or a robe and a dress?, why is it that women can wear shoes with a slightly higher heel but a man can‚Äôt?, were fashion designers in the Bible required to consult with god?, do modern day fashion designers have to consult with a priest or something?"
31,My gay ass is this obvious.
32,That hug is clearly non-consensual.
33,‚ÄúYou need to love me so I can save you from what I‚Äôm going to do to you if you don‚Äôt love me‚Äù
34,"If God was just and caring, he wouldn't send anybody to suffer eternal torment, let alone people whose only crime was not believing in him or having a non-het sexuality."
35,"Then don't wire our brains like this, god

Then don't make *the cake* so damn delicious, god

Then don't make my monkey neuron fire when *banana*, god

Anyway, study neurology and psychology sciences, christians. Evolve, why don't you"
36,it's so sad to see this image being co-opted by Christian homophobes
37,"Yeah he is the one sending people there, why not just stop?"
38,"I like to think Im this obvious, but then I know several people who didn't know I was gay after working with me for a few months."
39,"""I don't want you to go to hell when you die""

Then don't send me to hell when I die."
40,Why is the symbol of breast cancer a symbol of sin to them üòÇ
41,"Whenever someone claims that a Hell of infinite torture exists, I ask them, ""How will knowing that people are being tortured for eternity improve your existence in Heaven?""

I ask things like, ""For instance, what if it was your Mother?  Father?  Daughter or spouse?  Would you feel good in Heaven knowing they were burning in Hell?

And this is where you find out if they believe in an infinite torture Hell,  or some form of ""Hell Lite"".  Examples of Hell Lite:

1. They put themselves there!  They can't stand to be near God.  Hell is the absence of God!  
2. After a period of punishment, they will be made to cease to exist.
3. There is no Hell - you just stop existing.

I've heard all of these explanations and more.  Usually from people who have loved ones who are dead, who couldn't be expected to be in Heaven."
42,I mean some are like that. Have you seen the queer kiwi girl? üòÇ
43,"This is the mind gymnastics the typical christian does, to justify his hate for gay people for themselves.   
What!? I dont hate gay people! But I dont want them to act out on who they are or marry who they love. But I dont hate them! I just want to strip them from basic human affection!!!1111!!"
44,Then don't fucking send them to hell Jesus.
45,What the fuck is that green cloud behind Jesus? Did he let one off? Is that why she's so shocked?
46,"Are they trying to make punks look gay?

Edit: Not saying gay in a bad way."
47,"Genuinely cant rmb the source, but iirc the original version had no text and was just supposed to show that Jesus accepted the person"
48,Some but a minority are
49,The fun ones usually are
50,God is such a pervert. Who cares. The world has actual problems
51,"‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going to abuse you, mentally torture you and kill you if you don‚Äôt listen‚Äù"
52,"huh well if god doesnt want us to go to hell then he can just forgive us for our sins, you know, like he does for priests and nuns who abuse children."
53,Yeah we are.  I'm bi and all of us lgbtq+ people have to carry around a rainbow flag so that straight people can identify us and avert their children's gaze from us lest they catch the dreaded gay virus through vision.
54,If heaven is full of the types of people I‚Äôve seen in evangelical churches then I want to go to the other place.
55,"My response ""I have more proof hell doesn't exist than you have that he'll exists"""
56,"i‚Äôve had people surprised when i said i liked men. so no, not obvious."
57,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, ‚Äòcause it doesn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ jus‚Äô like you jesus.‚Äù"
58,"Jesus, the ultimate malignant narcissistic psychopath. Love me or you will burn in hell"
59,"I'd say Jesus knows a little more about Hell than you do, pal, because he invented it, and then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honor."
60,"Don‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a made-up place just like heaven!"
61,I wish they hugged me too
62,How else would the cartoon artist show the big gay?
63,‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we say we want you to die and disown you and leave you without any support system whatsoever!‚Äù
64,"Ok, then, don't make them gay"
65,"Considering the judgemental and downright evil shit coming from ""Christians"" that sometimes seems to practically celebrate violating the Golden Rule, guess who'd be going to hell if such a thing existed?"
66,"I hate when Christians misuse this damn artwork.

At least this time they didn't whitewash him. That's something, I guess."
67,"To bad Jesus, I do"
68,Jesus is going to bone that dude like he boned the beloved disciple
69,Not only that but didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúHe‚Äù make them that way? Like is he sorry? I thought he was infallible?
70,"I must say that the fact that this jesus isn't white, blonde and wears stars and stripes, doesn't help a lot. :/"
71,I try to be that obvious
72,‚ÄúRemember kids if you take drugs you go to hell before you die‚Äù
73,I doubt Satan cares if you're gay... I mean he is dating Sadam hussein
74,"They've obviously never seen an openly gay person irl before. Maybe they've seen a few photos of the more extreme looking people at Pride, and think that's all The Gays^(tm)"
75,you know the person who drew this hates gays and craves for them to burn in hell
76,If that's how it works we will all have hell of a time. Heaven must be boooring...
77,"I'd very much like to go to hell, if it means that's where the good people are as you are suggesting."
78,"Dear human,

I don't want you to go to the hell that I designed specifically for eternal punishment for everyone who didn't do exactly what I want. I'm omniscient, and set an impossible standard knowing literally no one could stand up to it. And I'm omnipotent, so I could just fucking forgive your shortcomings, like I did before I murdered my own kid to satisfy my unending rage and jealousy. But then you wouldn't feel worthless, and you wouldn't need me, and I can't distinguish between need and love. Even though I know everything. Allegedly.

I'm definitely not a war god from a pastoral, iron age desert culture. I definitely wasn't yoinked from my place within a greater pantheon, removed from nearly all of my historical context, layered upon a bunch of other gods from other religions, and then called upon by people throughout history for waves of genocide and war (ironically, my original wheelhouse).

Love me by fearing me, because I am love and it cannot exist without me, doncha know. I think you're a piece of shit because I made you that way. I'm an all-seeing-all-knowing entity in control of all the complexities of the multiverse (not a local god worshipped by tribes, remember), and I care deeply  about whom you have sex with. Now follow these unclear steps that have changed many times over the millennia, and remember that if you get it wrong, I will torture you beyond time and space. Forever.

XOXO, the big Y guy"
79,This is horrifically offensive and condescending but at least they made jesus brown
80,nobody asked. fuck off.
81,"Well then don't send them there, you self-righteous dickhead"
82,"It's ironic, coming from a guy that didn't marry, and hung out with a bunch of dudes in a desert. Yeah, totally NOT gay."
83,"Lmao, why do they think we carry flags everywhere we go..."
84,‚ÄòAlfred Molina IS Jesus in He Has Risen 2: The Quickening!‚Äô
85,At least they got Jesus' skin color right.
86,Now kith.
87,"""Please stop making me hurt you."" 
 
Yeah that's not gonna inspire much adoration, dude."
88,Remember the scene in Jo Jo Rabbit when the little nazi doesn‚Äôt believe the girl is Jewish because she doesn‚Äôt look like he was told she would based on propaganda.
89,"Reminds me of when I was getting some coffee in the kitchen and my mother was there just organizing or something and was like ‚ÄúSon one day the rapture is gonna happen and everyone in this house is going to disappear except you. We‚Äôll all have gone two heaven and the world will be changed, you‚Äôll have to- blah blah blah.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt anything I didn‚Äôt know, I had just assumed they weren‚Äôt aware of my religious status or lack of, since I had been very much checked out since 2011 but always had a ‚ÄúCool! That‚Äôs nice!‚Äù kind of approach to their drivel. 

I suppose it‚Äôs very relieving and freeing that it‚Äôs just out in the open now. I was always worried she‚Äôd fuss over me like she did over her non religious brother, or other sons. I still hear her from time to time whining and hoping that we‚Äôll ‚Äúfind our faith again‚Äù and it‚Äôs never going to happen, but at least she‚Äôs not as obnoxious about it as I thought she would be.

I appreciate it too, as I love my mother and father, but I can‚Äôt share their beliefs. They‚Äôve recently been indulging in getting grifted by some mega church conman from the comfort of their home TV, and that man has spewed the most homophobic, sexist and transphobic drivel I‚Äôve ever heard- and they‚Äôve eaten it up. I can understand my naive mothers hope of eternal salvation, but if it‚Äôs tied together with hatred and intolerance then I want no part of it, and at this point I can‚Äôt pretend any longer either."
90,"Well maybe if gawd came down in person like that and said it, I'd take it seriously. But instead, it always seems to be some vicious, mean spirited, semi literate, inbred, goat f*cker. Maybe gawd needs to fire his PR people."
91,I like to think the quote comes from the person holding the flag
92,"These are the same people who believe if they outlaw something it ceases to exit.  By rolling back Roe v Wade they apparently think abortions will not happen, by outlawing marriage equality gay people will ‚Äògo away‚Äô, and by making evangelical ‚ÄòChristianity‚Äô the official State religion all other religions and beliefs will miraculously disappear (this, of course, would include Judaism, Islam, Atheism, and true Christianity).  It is obvious to me that their eventual goal is to turn this country into a theocracy led by rich white men."
93,Twist! she‚Äôs an overly supportive straight mom who tithes less than she is supposed to.
94,isn't that a scientist from SCP
95,"Well, Jesus makes the rules so if he really wouldn't want that person to burn in hell, he wouldn't sent them there. But its the mentality ""look what you made me do"". That kind of god isnt worth worshiping"
96,"Unfortunately, there ARE some that are that obvious. Honestly, I couldn't care less if someone is gay, trans, etc., but I don't see the need to throw it in my face time and again, like I owe You something. Not treating you different isn't enough? Thought you Wanted to be treated Equally."
97,"Depending how you interpret the bible 

Being gay or queer is really not a sin

In the book of Genesis, or i think it was unofficial. A group of angels raped Sodom, they were banished from heaven and the action was deemed a sin. That's where the word sodomy came from. One can interpret it as ""anal or oral sex is a sin"", or ""the act of sex without consent of the receiver is a sin"". I think it only makes logical sense that the latter is the case since it is inherently immoral to do something to someone without them wanting it in the first place

Ofc some people conclude that only gay people have anal sex therefore being gay is a sin on the basis that anal sex is a sin. That's how we got the situation we are in, at least i think"
98,"It's straight up victim blaming. A common tactic used by abusers, manipulators and cult leaders."
99,"A dude named NateTalksToYou made a really smart comparison between the Islamic God and an abusive partner, but it can be used with any God in general. It was mind-blowing, really. [(This video's last parts)](https://youtu.be/_o5ZZTk1sYg)"
100,"Exactly. If he‚Äôs all-knowing, all-powerful, all-loving, and doesn‚Äôt want us going to hell, then there would be no hell or means of access to it, right?"
