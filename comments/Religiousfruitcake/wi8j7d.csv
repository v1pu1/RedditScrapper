34,"‚ÄúA religious decree by Khomeini ordered that girl prisoners who are virgins must be raped before execution, to prevent them from entering heaven.‚Äù

Imagine believing that god is powerful enough to create life and the universe, but somehow you‚Äôre so arrogant that you believe you can stop someone going to heaven by simply committing some act the person doesn‚Äôt even consent to. 

I can‚Äôt comprehend how someone can believe in an immortal being who is all knowing and somehow believe that they‚Äôre smart enough to find a loophole. That level of arrogance just bewilders me."
