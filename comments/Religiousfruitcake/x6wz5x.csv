1,"Hey, I never knew there's a state called Heaven in the US, sounds cool, maybe that'll be my first stopüòÇüòÇ

But seriously, what's up with Ohio ? What's wrong with the state that these people think it's hell ?"
2,"Please, let me choose Hell! Anything to stay out of Ohio."
3,‚ÄúAre we dead? Or is this Ohio?‚Äù
4,All I can say as a New Jerseyan is thank God another state got chosen as hell instead of us. That‚Äôs an all-time first.
5,I'm already there baby
6,OH GOD NOT OHIO ANYWHERE BUT OHIO
7,"There has never been a greater misuse of a word than Christians using ""truth"" when they mean belief."
8,This Michigander giggled. Thanks OP
9,"Ohio has produced over 20 astronauts. More astronauts per capita than any other state. It begs the question, what is it about Ohio that makes so many people want to leave the planet?"
10,"As a wise man once said ""I'm really sorry, not because your sister had to move in with your aunt, but because she had to move to Ohio"""
11,"Well, for once I want to go to heaven"
12,What bothers me most is the fact that someone spent so much money to put that on a billboard.
13,Why do those have to be the only choices?! üòü
14,Canada
15,It‚Äôs better than West Virginia. ‚ÄúAlmost Heaven‚Äù is just a nice way of saying Hell.
16,"*shaking head in terror whispering* No, no, the gods would not be so cruel"
17,This reminds me of [this scene](https://youtu.be/jLTxP9kLd8A?t=374) from Red Dead Redemption 2.
18,"Redder than a baboons ass.  If I hadn't left, I'm sure I'd be asked to. By family, no less."
19,Is this a joke about the fact that Ohio is hot as hell in summer?
20,Well a 10 yr old girl was denied abortion in Ohio so ig you can say that
21,Ohio isn‚Äôt that bad. Lol
22,wtf I don't even understand this one
23,"Funny, my abuser was from Ohio"
24,Neither. I'll be in Maryland if anyone needs me to make poison-laced food/drinks.
25,I think this is shopped bc people are always ripping on Ohio.
26,You kinda have to go there to know
27,"So heaven is Iowa and hell is Ohio, it all makes sense now"
28,Mississippi has entered the chat. I think the only reason they didn‚Äôt use it is bc it‚Äôs too long a word üòÖ
29,[Our nation‚Äôs official joke state shall be New Jersey.](https://youtu.be/-z9FMxgf310)
30,*take him to Detroit*
31,"This Kentuckian did, too, and almost choked on my coffee."
32,I believe it has produced the most US presidents too. There must be a lot of motivation to gtfo of Ohio.
33,It's not about leaving. It's about conquest. Ohio also has the most Presidents.
34,Yes it is. I live here. It sucks
35,Sounds like something the devil would say‚Ä¶
36,"It is shopped, the original says hell. Looks like the org that runs the phone number is in Ohio though and there are definitely signs like this in Ohio, so it's likely that's why it was shopped to say that."
37,It is. The text is perfectly parallel with the image's edges but the billboard is viewed from an angle.
