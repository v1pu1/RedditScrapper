1,"The Oglala Lakota Nation made the right choice, judging by that nasty racism. Looks like they were getting a bunch of White Savior types condescending them. Hope they rest easy now that they officially banned those clowns."
2,"In 1797, the Senate unanimously ratified the Treaty of Tripoli, which emphatically declares that “the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. Just gonna leave this here.  America isn't a Christian  nation.

I don't care that you want others to believe. 
""Go back to your own country"" . This person is an idiot.  Many native tribes were here way before  Americans ever set foot in what is now the US.
Damn  if you don't know the basics of history  and have access to the internet.  There is really zero excuse for ignorance as an adult or teenager  with the wealth of knowledge available to us through a simple search.
