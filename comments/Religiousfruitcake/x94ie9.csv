4,"Talk about a cum to jebus moment, yowza"
5,Are we really just ignoring the dog like gimp mask?????
6,"95% chance these were made by an old Mexican lady who found the buttplugs on discount, had no idea what they even were, and thought they'd be just right to make her craft.

Said lady is probably an absolute darling."
7,I‚Äôm not gonna lie: I‚Äôve always loved that picture of Jesus where he looks sassy and dramatic.
8,"Brings new meaning to the term ""*Oh Jesus*""."

11,"""i mean, there's nothing inherently fruitcakey about little knick knacks, as long as-- *wait just a fucking minute""*"
12,"Well the faithful are always telling us to let Christ come into us, so I guess the Church would approve.

If Christians saw jeebus today and he looked like that they'd call him a (homophobic slur)"
25,r/dildont
26,Honestly? I'd get one just for display.
27,"Imagine an archaeologist unearthing one of these in 2,000 years and trying to figure out what it is.

""It is evidently a ritual object for religious purposes, possibly representing abstract easter-eggs and christmas-trees, which were popular festivals at the time""

""The man in the dog-mask must be a depiction of St. Christopher, this plate is a lone piece of evidence for an unprecedented resurgence in his Veneration""."
28,"That's not fruitcake, that's just religious paraphernalia- \*reads comments*
