1,"Ah yes, the noble and pure marriage between a 53yr old man and a 6yr old girl..."
2,"""ummm theres other pedos, so that means ours is allowed."""
3,Yes the worst part of pedophilia is that it’s done in secret…
4,Tell us you're a pedophile without saying you're a pedophile. The projection is palpable and vile.
5,"The mental gymnastics they do is almost world class. ""Western pedophilia is evil because the children aren't being raped by holy prophets."""
6,"Noble pure and forced marriage.

Say it. A child can not consent"
7,"Don't worry everyone, Muslims have decided to re-write their history and now Aisha was 19 instead of 9.  

I suppose if it's all made up in the first place, who cares if a few details are updated for modern times?"
8,"He understands it is done in secrete because we arrest and punish those that do it, so they have to hide it right? And sure,

 they don't have to jump through all the hopes to do it over there, but you honestly think the girls forced in to marriages are any happier about it there? It is still the exact same fate in the end, just one it is hidden, and punished if caught, while there, it is just allowed."
9,"Basically…

“*Abductions, degrading, vile sex acts with children is bad but only if you follow the wrong religion.*”

Oh, religion, is there nothing you can’t excuse."
10,WTF asshole straight up equated pedophilia to some noble and pure thing
11,You know I feel like sexually abusing a child is bad regardless of the manner in which it is done. That's just me though
12,"Not only, but child marriages and slavery of young girls are allowed in Islam openly. It’s not just the prophet, all his followers had done these things and in no way did he contribute to stop it. 

Child marriages are still very common in Islamic countries, and the reason we don’t see them owning slaves is because it was forecfully abolished."
13,Not that pedophilia is known to be relatively common in the Middle East and Central Asia or anything.
14,"When your religion and society supports your pedo acts, that doesn't make it ok. WTF with some people?"
15,“Diddling” is the worst word in the dictionary this whole disgusting thread made my skin itch
16,He seems to know a lot about how pedophilia works.
17,"If the stories about Moohamad (piss be upon him) are to be believed, then he was a disgusting pedo, and Islam is a disgusting religion for deifying him."
18,"""Our pedophiles are better than your pedophiles "". What the actual fuck a religious nut will try to justify."
19,Last i checked ppl like this are shunned and punished in the west
20,Tbh it sounds like a GQP wet dream until the last paragraph…
21,"Like what ISIS did to the ethnic/religious minority the yazidis, where they traded the women like sex slaves?"
22,"Girls that have essentially been kidnapped being tossed around among friends.

Why it's almost as if lil' Daniel is talking about the slaves that were captured following Mohamed's various conquests. Girls would become sex slaves for their master to do with as they please and sell them to their friends.

But hey, I'm sure Daniel will just say that this was a good thing cause Allah said so and we degenerates have no objective standard of morality."
23,“Only Our brand of pedophilia is allowed!!!”
24,Quick draw his picture
25,"So the problem with our pedophiles is that they enslave the child for the rest of its life to a organization guilty of destroying countless lives in horrific and unimaginable ways and their pedophiles are better because they enslave the child for the rest of its life to an organization guilty of destroying countless lives in horrific and unimaginable ways. 

Their pedophiles bring all the boys to the yard..."
26,"Okay outside this guys fruitcake shit, he at least is aware of the disgusting shit the rich of all societies are capable of now just to get him to see that its all over, regardless of religion."
27,The noble and pure marriage between a 53yr old **already married man** and a 6yr old girl.
28,"Hey! He only married her at 6, he didn't rape her till she was 9! - Fuckers who actually try to defend this."
29,I just heard that the age of consent in the US in Jefferson’s day was 10. 10 years old ffs
30,Whataboutism: the 6th pillar of Islam
31,I’m just thinking how thats the best argument they could come up with
32,“Our pedophiles are better than yours! Praise Allah!”
33,The Catholic Church would like a word with you.
34,Yh and they’re still fucking doing it FFS. That and they and other religions treat women like shit in general. As much as people complain about Western imperialism at least we tried to stop this sort of evil
35,Exactly
36,Any ideology can be used to excuse anything when being used by a sociopath.
37,"Yeah, I mean some may be more violent and horrible than others, but it's all bad.

Also I'm not sure specifically what they are referring to in the west. I'm sure stuff like this has happened because people are horrible, but they're talking like it's super common.

I mean I know there are a lot of child molesters, I just don't think big organized orgies are happening every night in every town like he makes it sound. I think he's getting some of this from that right wing conspiracy pizza gate type stuff.

Also he is talking about condoning it. ""The west"" at large does not condone this. It's against our laws, and the vast majority of people know it's reprehensible. Being that way but some sick bastards still do it is a long way off from the major religion and culture based on it condoning it."
38,Literally only you. If you're Muslim it's completely fine and dandy and the child even likes it.
39,Literally only you. If you're Muslim it's completely fine and dandy and the child even likes it.
40,That sounds like it means light fingering. Its way too soft of a term for rape.
41,I kind of struggle with accepting the Hadiths as reliable historical sources though
42,He clearly doesn’t think pedophilia is wrong because of the suffering inflicted on the victim
43,Daniel openly supports Islamic sex slavery as well.
44,The noble and pure marriage between a 53yr old already married man **with multiple sex slaves in addition to that** and a 6 year old girl.
45,"Already married several times, including once to his own adoptive son's ex-wife after forcing them to divorce."
46,It doesn't even make sense because at least one Western country(the USA) allows for child marriage in 44 stated mostly due to the wants of fundamentalist Christians. Molesting a child is molesting a child whether in the confines of marriage or not
47,"Precisely. Ask anyone in the west how they feel about pedophilia or sex with kids, and they’ll be disgusted and horrified. Ask the same question to a Muslim in the Muslim world, however….."
48,The noble and pure marriage between a 53yr old already married man with **multiple underage sex slaves in addition to that** and a 6 year old girl.
