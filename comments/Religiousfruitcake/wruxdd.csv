1,It took me too long to realize anemia was supposed to be anime
2,It must suck to have that person as a parent.
3,"finally someone willing to point out the anemic to weeb pipeline 

seriously tho the *reach* here"
4,"Timmy, I know you love your teddy bear, but it’s giving human characteristics to an animal, which would imply it has a soul, so it’s against the Bible."
5,"Tell her that in Shinto literally all nature is spiritual. She should not interact with anything, like literally anything, not even wood, cotton, metal..."
6,"I just got done watching Code Geass. It was a great anemia.

Seriously, food mascots are now evil? It’s a freaking chibi fox eating noodles. Does this person stomp into grocery stores demanding they stop carrying Count Chokula, too?"
7,You just cannot fix that kind of stupid!
8,I die a little inside every time I see a religious person criticizing people who enjoy any kind of fiction for “not living in reality.”
9,I hate anemia too because sometimes I can't donate blood when I want to 😤
10,>anemia
11,"Imagine how much healthier the planet might be if it hadn't been infected with Christians thinking that because animals don't have souls, doing anything at all to the environment is just fine."
12,"1. Whats giving animals humanistic characteristics? It’s a cartoon character. It’s not an animal, & it never was. It depicts an animal, though there’s never an actual animal being given humanistic characteristics. A depiction of a fictional creature is drawn, which is an animal with humanistic characteristics that are intrinsic to who it is. If it didn’t have those characteristics, it wouldn’t be the fictional character depicted. This is not a pen 🖊. Is there something wrong with depicting fictional animals with humanistic characteristics, because they have humanistic characteristics? 

2. Animals are not blessings to their food."
13,"What does it mean to hate anemia?

Like an inability to get enough oxygen in the blood sometimes is offensive?"
14,"Come on, it says ""ramen"" right there on the shirt."
15,"""I hate anemia""

I-... OOP you're aware that an- means none and -emia means presence of/in blood, correct? I mean I'd expect someone to hate having anemia"
16,"As an anemic, I can confirm it's evil"
17,"Did they really just say animals don’t have souls?

And, while we’re on the topic of Japan, i hope this fruitcake gets attacked by a Raiju"
18,"Foxes are traditionally a type of Shinto spirit: even of the trickster variety. There are many statues of foxes at Shinto shrines. So, I guess you could be worried about this as a Christian like you're worried about anything else.

Good thing it's all fake."
19,Jesus thank you
20,Lmao thank you I was so confused.
21,"Than you for translating, I thought she has a problem with anemia."
22,I mean… you could become anemic from eating too may Romen noodles. Those Romens don’t mess around.
23,"My guess was animism, but yours makes more sense."
24,"Additionally it must suck to have that person in your life, county, state etc...bitch must have been a gymnast because those are some serious stretches to make"
25,Just imagine being their child AND anemic
26,Well most weebs probably do have a touch of anemia and viramin D deficiency tbh
27,"IKR?!?  I mean, what the fuck??? ""Animals don't have souls""? As far as I'm concerned, they've got much greater souls than any of the Qcumbers I've seen, including some in my family!!

How does a person get this stupid?!?"
28,Yes. After all vampires are demonic beings.
29,Leave my Coco Pop's alone!
30,"Anemia sucks because it's demonic ! So periods are demonic too, because they create anemia."
31,I have no idea
32,She meant anime ?
33,"So do i, anaemia sucks"
34,If mental gymnastics was an Olympic sport this woman would be the worlds best athlete.
35,"my guess is that those are a side effect of being a weeb, not the cause lol"
36,Animales have soul and more compassion and sweetness than lot of humans.
37,That seems like an anemic answer. /S
38,Fasting for Jesus!
