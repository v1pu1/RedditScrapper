1,Better than sending to Christian ones where they might be abused
2,This woman is a bigot and a homophobe. I feel so sorry for her three adopted children. Her love for them will end the second they don't fall in line with her beliefs.
3,"I was sent to catholic school, it cured me of being catholic"
4,I love the whole phrase ‚Äúspiritual decision‚Äù‚Ä¶ Especially because it essentially completely robs their children of having any future decisions in advance.  That is until they grow older and reject the views of their parents which is far more typical now more than ever
5,Fucking crazy bitch using ‚ÄúBiBLiCaLBeAUtY‚Äù for her twitter id. Why are religious fucks so obsessed with projecting to the world that they are religious.
6,Educated people are less easy to control.  Of course the fruitcakes are against it.
7,"I'm scared for society to be honest. People are brainwashing their kids to believe in fairytales, deny science, not accept others and themselves even..."
8,"No words can say how much I would like to see, the video of her cat slapping her after the text was sent."
9,"I invite all you bible worshippers to make a commune, let's say the entire Texas panhandle, and just make it the independent state of Christonia. Secede from the union and then never let us hear from you again."
10,‚ÄúIm poor and I‚Äôm stupid and that‚Äôs why I believe in Jesus. Let up perpetuate this trend. Amen.‚Äù -These fucking people
11,How much does a soul cost?
12,"If its not indoctrination bootcamp its too liberal. Kids ""have to be forced into beliefs"" as they practice"
13,Brainwashing works best if they're never exposed to anything else.
14,Anything that could cause a member of the congregation to ask a question or expose them to a different view point is satan
15,"Not everyone can afford those crappy IBLP pamphlets, Melissa"
16,"You know what? Let‚Äôs have two different kinds of schools: 1 can be Christian and be in a state with lax gun laws and another will be secular and in a state with common sense restrictions and then I would like to see the fucking bullshit these people come up with when their schools end up being the most dangerous and it‚Äôs their kids that are gruesomely slaughtered.

Of course, crying ‚Äúfake news‚Äù will always be a get-out-of-facts free card for them so what‚Äôs the point in even talking to them? They‚Äôll never listen-even when the lives of children are involved, they will go on ignoring the egg on their face. 

I fucking hate them. Christians like this are some of the worst people on the planet and make our country a joke to the rest of the world. Grown adults that insist on playing make believe and act utterly confused and perplexed when others look at them like the crazy-fucks that they are."
17,"Non Christian schools meant for education oh the horror /S

Public schools are meant to be for legitimate education. Not teaching about your despicable god and the many tales of some individual or group of people. I remember watching the ten
commandments movie growing up and the bit about god speaking to Moses through a burning bush . Looking back that  sounds like what a person experiencing hallucinations  or being on drugs might go through."
18,Sending your kid to a fundamentalist Christian school should be considered child abuse IMO. You are purposely crippling their education and emotional well being just because you couldn't figure your shit out.
19,"Well, keep them at home, keep them stupid, don't vaccinate, but when they get sick don't bring them to the hospital, keep them at home and cure them with prayers and essential oils. You will do the rest of us a favor."
20,Hey hey let‚Äôs not forget about how necessary it is to start brainwashing early. I mean if you want the grooming to work!
21,"Religious schools should be illegal. Brain washing and indoctrination is considered child abuse in any other circumstances. It should be with religion too. It irrefutably causes massive harm. And violates the child's freedom of religion completely stripping their 1st amendment rights, at least here in America. It is still destroying their religious freedom anywhere where else. Forcing a religion down an impressionable child's throat, one incapable of critical or rational thought can not be considered ok. The child saying yes they want to be Christian or whatever other religion is no more a real yes, then the yes a child molester can get from his victim to make themselves feel better. The child doesn't understand what is happening, doesn't know what is real or not, and just wants to make the adult happy. In both situations. It is not a real yes. And is thus child abuse. And needs to be treated as such."
22,"If you can‚Äôt be a Christian without religious indoctrination throughout your school career, you have to wonder why it‚Äôs so hard to convince people to be Christians?"
23,My parents felt great about it because they had me guilted and brainwashed into believing that if I didn't make a point to tell my classmates about jesus at any opportunity I had that I would go to hell. Safe to say I wasn't a very popular kid lmaoooo
24,"They'd rather their kids become brainwashed christians than be able to go to a university and get a job that'll allow them to have a decent life in the future. I know a couple who homeschool their kids (for that reason) and they don't have any structure to do it. The result is a 12yr old who can't even read or write. But hey at least he's not being ""groomed"""
25,"Forget their minds, what about their little souls??"
26,"Classic Christianity, devising a system where it is your moral imperative to GIVE ME MONEY!"
27,"> the most costly spiritual decision they've ever made.

...okay, but wait - if a God were real and there were evidence of their existence other than ""because I said so"", public school would have very little impact on belief or religious choice, since, ya know, there's _evidence_."
28,Don't forget the free brainwashing and potential harassment from the local priest.
29,My time at a Christian school was valuable context for my decision that there was nothing supernatural about Christianity.
30,‚ÄúMight‚Äù‚Ä¶üíÅüèº
31,I got a Bachelor‚Äôs in Biblical Studies and Biblical Languages. I am now an atheist.
32,This
33,True bat at that point they would already have been extremely harmed by their parents decision. They would have to learn everything their parents didn't teach them by themselves if they ever want to go to an university for example
34,It's the Christofascist version of virtue signaling.
35,She ain't all that good lookin' either.
36,"The sad thing is, here in Texas the Christians have taken over the educating system and have forced the teaching Christian ideologies in public schools. That's one of the reasons I pulled my kids out of public schools. That, and the fact that they were doing absolutely *nothing* to help my autistic son. (Just to be clear, it's the *system* that's screwed up. The staff was wonderful, but there's a limited amount they can do with zero resources.)"
37,"Unfortunately, Christians are huge proselytes. They won't be happy until every individual soul in the universe follows their specific branch."
38,"It's more likely for whales to return to land than for religious schools to be banned. You have to carefully define ""religious school"" and that could kinda be seen as the state messing with religion, as the state‚Äìchurch separation should be both ways. Also, Americans hate their freedom being restricted and that ban will feed the Christian diogmophilia."
39,"Growing up as a Muslim in a Muslim majority country and having to go to religious classes after school, the indoctrination was deep! I only opened my eyes when I was 18 when I was in Paris for my education. It took me another 5 years to finally deprogrammed.

I ended up marrying an atheist and my daughter will not have any of that!"
40,So you are jobless now?
41,"Oh, I know‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the worst part.  ‚ÄúProgression through unlearning‚Äù.  And it often takes just as long to undo what was done.  At some point, religious fundamentalism is going to meet a foe it just can‚Äôt overcome as the culture is shifting further away from this garbage."
42,Comes across as more like vice signaling to others \^ \^ ' .
43,That‚Äôs why she needs the Biblical beauty to compensate.
44,"It isn't the starte messing with religion. It is them stopping child abuse, plain and simple. Yes, there are stupid people who would pretend they are being persecuted but they do that anyway. Allowing religions to be forced on kids is a direct and irrefutable 1st amendment rights violation. Not to mention the other harm caused by it. Sadly, I do agree it won't happen. But it objectively should. These schools are wrong, cause harm, and are in all ways child abuse, there is no way around that fact."
45,Good
46,"Proud of you, boo! üéâ"
47,"I got my degree in 2005. I worked a lot of crappy dead-end jobs while I ‚Äúwaited on god‚Äù for direction. That direction never came and my church (somewhat large) never offered me any vocational opportunities even though I was probably the most Biblically educated person in that fucking place-it was almost like I was a threat to them. Plus, I was going through gay conversion therapy that was not working and I think the longer that went on, the more egg they had on their face for basically ruining my life with their religious bullshit.

I lost my faith in 2013 and started a career in IT shortly thereafter. Religion is so utterly destructive. The people it produces are so stupid, illogical and delusional that they are quite useless in the economy and society in general. Sure, a lot of people can avoid the pitfalls that I succumbed to, but they weren‚Äôt consumed with terror over the fact that they were gay and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how gorgeous some men were. I got my degree because I thought God told me to get it. My church told me that studying Scripture would reprogram my brain and free me from homosexuality. Just writing about it now infuriates me. I don‚Äôt want to go into detail about what I‚Äôd like to do to the fat pastor if I thought that I could get away with it. He‚Äôd deserve it too."
