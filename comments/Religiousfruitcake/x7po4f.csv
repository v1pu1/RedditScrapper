1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"If you believe the text to be of an omniscient god then of course you'd presume it applies everywhere.

 The alternative is to say god gives release notes only and defers to humans to expand on updates and patches, and all DLC.

 The second is how religions function, but the former is far more logical within relative concept of the powers of the deity."
2,"Well he's right tho, Islam make sense 1000 years ago. But today? Nah.."
3,"Muhammed told me that Vishnu said that women are supposed to be the ones in charge because Allah said men are lacking in self control.

\~Hadith \[today\]"
4,"I don’t know much about Islam, but isn’t Hadith written by subsequent Imams and not the word of Mohammad?"
5,"It's a recommendation not an obligation from hadiths, it's a recommendation because lots of outside men could make women traveling alone uncomfortable. It was recommended because in those times there were a lot of conflicts between villages and their ""easy targets"" were women and kids alone. It's all about protection and sadly lots of Muslim men today want to control women instead of protecting them like prophet Muhammad sws and the Quran teached"
6,"It’s worth noting that it was mostly a regurgitation of existing traditions and religions at that time.

Islam was mostly cherry-picking from these traditions and religions in the area."
7,"Hadith is a telephone game about Muhammad's words. Basically someone said that someone said someone said that someone said that someone heard Muhammad said something 

It's a very integral part of Islam, without hadith Islam will be radically different. They won't know how to pray. Because Quran doesn't tell us about a lot of things. We call people that don't believe in hadith as quranist, a very minority of Islam"
8,It can be forged big time
9,"Yeah religion is reflection of the past, nothing to do with the word of ""God"" at all"
