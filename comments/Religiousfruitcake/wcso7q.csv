1,If jesus is watching premarital sex isnt that basically watching porn.
2,Ah yes Harry Potter witchcraft not wicca or a history on historical witchcraft just the scary kids book.
3,"Romans 15:7 ""Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.""

So... he was against acceptance? Really? Why do they even have a holy text if they've never actually read it?"
4,"> Accepting others!

Jesus: 😡"
5,"Sorry to disappoint but yeah, this is satire. I know because I made it for my exvangelical meme account. But I do know a number of Christians who  believe that yoga is demonic as well as Harry Potter."
6,"Ah. So Jesus is a judgmental dick who forbids sleeping with whoever we want, who wants to be in control of what we do and read, and who wants us to hate other people. What an asshole."
7,This is deffo a spoof....right? .......right guys??
8,![gif](giphy|KjdpBT4j79NJe)
9,Nah this is definitely satire
10,"This feels like satire lol. Also, a meme template waiting to happen"
11,"Yoga?????

So that bastard doesn't want people to stay healthy?"
12,Ah yes. Anti-LGBTQ+. Nice.
13,Fuck yoga in particular
14,"This is satire, yes, but as a child I was banned from reading HP and doing yoga by my crazy Evangelical family. Yoga was considered too close a religious experience considering its roots in spirituality. So that meant it wasn’t Christian 🙄"
15,"I love how they just say the quiet part out loud. ""Accepting others"" at what point do they just say ""yeah I'm a part of the bigotry machine and I'm proud"""
16,"Wow, this version of Jesus is kinda pervy, isn't he?"
17,"If jebus is watching my sex maybe he could give some pointers on improving my technique, since he sees so much of it - thanks Jebus"
18,"Jesus is always watching?  So, he watched me jerk off to gay BDSM porn?  Fucking perv."
19,Always reject others according to Jesus
20,Is this supposed to be jesus? Dude looks like Dave Grohl.
21,Jesus needs to fucking relax.
22,"Ahh yes a book series written by a terf, the epitome of modern witchcraft /s."
23,Jesus looks pretty constipated. Can someone get Jesus some prunes?
24,"Ah, wikiHow images.

Definitely an improvement from using stock images to prove a point."
25,"Literally thinks that ""accepting others"" is something Jesus hates, like, you know that Jesus whole message was ""love everyone""? Lol"
26,"I have an evangelical relative who is anti-yoga.  I asked if he had tried yoga for his back pain, and I got a lecture on how it’s a way to trick you into worshiping Hindu deities, which apparently leads to devil worship."
27,Isn’t “jesus” himself a result of premarital sex?
28,"God that fucking yoga has to go!  Helping people to destress, stay flexible, and gain strength. It’s definitely  satanic. /s"
29,You know an atheist made this.
30,"Ah yes, Jesus who famously hates accepting others"
31,Does he (Jesus) have any tips on the sex one? I'm a newbie and think I'm doing it wrong. I mean he's seen a *lot* of sex so has a good idea.
32,"This is almost certainly satire.

Like, I could see these same images and template being used, but they would consider Harry Potter and Yoga to both be witchcraft. And they would use something more homophobic for ""accepting others""."
33,the accepting others makes this feel satire. it's kinda hilarious if it isn't though
34,What the hell did they use as a reference for a rainbow?
35,"Accepting others is bad?

Love thy neighbor?
Just not too much. And it really depends on whom your neighbour's are...."
36,Accepting others grrr
37,This is satire i think
38,This is hilarious Jesus looks like a rapist in this
39,"The upper right square admits the problem!

They just don't want to get along with people who do not share their beliefs!

I just don't see a positive future for the human race as long as religion preaches not accepting others and instead preaching hate and fear to them which then leads to them telling them we are a threat!

This kind of BS is what leads to authoritarianism every single time!"
40,"God: Do not partake in premarital sex!! 

Me: But it's okay for Lot to offer up his two virgin daughters to be gang raped??

God: Hell yeah! I endorse that shit 100%!!"
41,"Accepting others!

The man who hung out with the lepers and sex workers judges you!"
42,TIL Jesus has RBF
43,If you can't tell this is satire you need psychiatric help
44,Woo hoo I'm 4 for 4!
45,"Poe's law..

Can't tell if real or trolling it's so ridiculous lol"
46,Is Jesus jerking off?
47,"Reading, being tolerant and kind and finding an activity that helps your mind and body are SINS !"
48,"If your sky wizard is upset that you do yoga, it's time to reevaluate your beliefs."
49,Wait the actions conveyed in the picture are literally the okay-est stuff ever. Why Jesus gotta be a party pooper for no reason?
50,They should have made the premarital sex one with a POC to make it even more caliente
51,"I can confirm that, after reading the series once, you gain basic magical powers. With each read through the series you unlock more and more powers, until you've reached 100 rereads and then you are god."

66,"This is satire, fam."
67,"These all sound like good things to do and people to hang out with, I don't see anything wrong"
68,I just realized I’ve never seen “angry Jesus”. Until now.
69,I get the vibes that this could almost be satirical and not an actual Christian that creates this.
70,Man satire really is dead these days.
71,jesus sounds like a dick
72,😡
73,This is satire.
74,"""Jesus is watching you accept others"" is just a hilariously ridiculous thing to put on there, because wasn't a core thing about Jesus was that he accepted everyone?"

83,"One of my favorite Family Guy lines

""Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hated many people, but none more than the homosexuals"""
84,Tbf yoga is like the most evil act a human being an commit by far
85,"Ok, so I kind of get how you can justify hating gays....*like i'm trying to save their soul*. Fuck off, but I get it. 

But yoga?"
86,Could be that Jesus is watching all this and judging it as completely brilliant.
87,I mean for a dude who hung out with criminals and whores and whose dad had him executed he is one judgmental SOB
88,"So Jesus watches me have sex?

Ain’t that a sin, Jesus? Better watch out, Daddy is watching."

91,"I still say that being made to believe some imaginary old man in the sky was watching my every move and judging me by my actions, did irreparable damage to my mental health.

Fuck religion."
92,Wait wait Accepting Others is a sin? Wow the murican right is so far gone
93,Kinda hot with Jesus watching
94,"Me: Having sex in a Harry Potter costume, in a yoga position while accepting other sexualities.
Jesus: You are not supposed to do that😡"
