1,So is he saying that a pious Muslim should *enjoy* homosexuality?
2,"See, that's the funny thing. Literally ONLY religious people ""suffer"" from homosexuality. Or at least those in highly religious communities and the like."
3,No they only suffer from stupidity
4,"When I was a muslim I used to pray in mosque everyday, Fast all of ramadan every year and debate atheists and Christians when ever they criticize islam. 

Still ended up being gay as fuck. Screw your religion."
5,It's just the typical religious victim blaming - saying that any hardship you face is your fault for not being pious enough. It's a great tactic because it helps them pretend the world is ruled by a just and good diety by ignoring reality around them.
6,I'm not taking shit from a guy who's last name sounds like a obscure spell in a mmorpg. Also one could say he's saying that a pious Muslim enjoys homosexuality lmao
7,"No, they only suffer from stupidity."

17,"Religious people are IMHO either really bad at connecting separate but related pieces of information or really good at finding ignoring paradoxes between their dogma and reality.

I mean, how can you believe in an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, benevolent diety that has a plan for everyone and simultaneously have around 5000 dead annually to choking in US alone (4963 in 2020)? 

By putting the blame on the victim you can easily sidestep the issue altogether without straining your beliefs."
18,"Islam good,  gay bad"
