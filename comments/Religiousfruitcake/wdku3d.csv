1,These people make satan look good.
2,The well-known misogynist
3,"Fruitcakes once again proving that Satan is the logical, rational and moral choice. Noice!"
4,"As a woman, it’s obvious why I chose atheism!"
5,This guy is also a lawyer.  He represents (in a possibly illegal way) several neo-Nazi and white supremacist organisations by acting as a middle man for fundraising where they would otherwise be banned from some online funding programs.
6,This guy is one miserable SOB.
7,"Men and women are not equal, in Corey’s eyes, because all women are better than Corey."
8,Hail Satan then
9,"The Bible also gives you the authority to take slaves from other nations permanently, and says it's okay to beat them as long as they recover after two days.


Like the Bible isn't the ideal basis of morality for modern society, part of it was written like 4000 years ago."
10,Everything I don’t like is the work of satan (and other untruths to tell yourself.)
11,“Muslims are bad because ____!” Says the Christian who believes in everything they criticize
12,"Fuck him and his scripture, it's doesn't apply to those who have not subscribed to it no matter what the door knob fucker thinks."
13,They will do everything they can to turn Liberals into inhuman monsters. That way they can do whatever against them and not feel guilty.
14,"According to the bible, yes, this is completely true. Many religions are this way, men got power in early civilization, and wanted to keep it, so it was ingrained in many religions that women are there to just serve. And to work at home, the ""gathers"" and all that. Of course, we know that before civilization roles were basically evenly divided. People did what they were best at. And just as many women hunted and were in ""masculine"" roles as men, with just as many men at home ""gathering"" and all that. There is no part of our nature to back up gender roles or anything like that. It is just something religions made up to stop women from usurping the men's control."
15,The refrain of weak men everywhere.
16,This is just one of many reasons why religion is bullshit.
17,Emlightenment is satanism lol
18,Sounds like someone is using their fruitcakery to hide their smol pp nrg.
19,[deleted]
20,"According to some interpretations of “scripture” he’s probably right but, as my grandaddy used to say, “fuck scripture”"
21,Good thing scripture isn't the law of the land.
22,"Pretty sure giving head and being sub is against your interpretation of the scriptures since ""sex is only for procreation and not for pleasure."""
23,"I *love* how the concept that teaching that women and men are not equal is actually demonic just never occurs to these nutbars.

/s"
24,"If you literally go by the Bible, women should marry their rapists and slavery is A-OK. A moral code for ancient nomadic tribes isn’t exactly relevant to the age of the Internet."
25,Is that supposed to be an iron cross at the end of that name? 'cause that's all you really need to know if so.
26,No it just pisses you off
27,That picture looks like James Galdolfini playing Alex Jones ... just saying.
28,Why does every thing desirable seem to be demonic?
29,Well then… Hail Satan
30,well call me fizzeroli because uwu
31,hail Satan then.
32,"To be fair, this IS exactly what many religions explicitly state. Dude isn't a fruitcake, he is living through the rules of the club. Fruitcake religions"
33,if equality is demonic then Hail Satan
34,And this is why It confuses me even more when women become pastors or reverends or whatever religious head bs.
35,And this is why your superstitions are dying out. Fuck you and the misogynistic horse you rode in on.
36,I give this man a 10 but it’s on the Ph scale
37,"The worst part is that he's right, that is exactly what it says. No place for that shit in this century."
38,"I mean his not wrong. The bible does teach that.

This is why Christians don't have any morals"
39,Maybe scriptures are just demonic....forget the rest lol
40,"I love how they call all good things satanic.
Maybe that Satan guy isn't that bad after all."
41,"You know what, at this point I will gladly burn in hell for this demonic ideologies. If Satan is for equality, promotes love in any and every shape of form between two consenting adults, promotes autonomy over your own body, etc, Im sure Hell is a pretty chill place"
42,Funny. Because I seem to recall God making man and woman *equal*.
43,"A'ight i'mma say it again

HAIL SATAN!"
44,"I have not heard Satan's side yet, but so far he has my vote"
45,The morning star is good. He isn't the one that committed genocide and infanticide.
46,Literally. Especially if “Heaven” is full of idiots like this guy
47,"Satan believes in equal rights, gay rights and is against oppression? Sign me up"
48,"Sometimes I think they know they are, but I don’t think they are"
49,You're saying that as if this tweet didn't explicitly say equality is evil
50,Even better ✨satanism ✨
51,Just know this guy is absolutely misinterpreting the Bible. Some people are just stupid.
52,He does seem to be the good guy in that story doesn’t he?
53,"Ah, the inevitable ""bad person = small penis"" comment. Do you realize how hurtful it is for men with small penises to be openly ridiculed for something out of their control and then go on to be compared to shitty people?"
54,"Hell I’m not even a Christian and the bible *still* says that, weird."
55,The iron cross has nothing to do with nazis and actually predates them. The iron cross is still used today in Germany in the armed forces! It's weird that he uses that in his name... Maybe cuz the guy is simply dumb.
56,"made man and women in his own image, not equal."
57,"You should try reading the bible before you talk shit from it, at least."
58,Hail Satan
59,Hail Satan and  have a lovely afternoon madam.
60,HAIL SATAN!🔥
61,Satan was the original independent journalist.
62,God always uses him as a scapegoat.
63,Heaven sounds like North Korea but you get magical powers lolz
64,No. I'm saying that bc of his older misogynistic tweets.
65,"He's not, tho..."
66,"Calm down fella,  you'll see its about the energy they give off rather than any actual appendage size. In the same way [big dick energy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Big%20Dick%20Energy) has nothing to do with size, just how you present yourself to the world."
67,"Actually, man and woman are created equally at first before it's retconned a few pages later."
68,I could’ve sworn it was in there. But go on and attack me.
69,"Hail to Satan! Hail to the lord of truth and equality!

(Thought that fitted here)"
70,"He really is. While the Bible asks a wife to submit to her husband, the husband is also to submit to his wife. This guy is just as bad as atheists cherry picking what he wants it to say."
71,"1 Timothy 2's author seems to think the order of creation means man is a priority:

>11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

Of course, that second point ignores that Adam was present with Eve and ate the fruit too in the Genesis story in order to shit on women."
72,"""I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.""

This is just the worst one, there's literally dozens of examples."
73,Yep. The first critical thinker.
74,Hail Seitan! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlscPaCx87Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlscPaCx87Y&list=OLAK5uy_l_OAB-lEAjvn8rVxDpKpzKAaP9aHbU1tU&index=11)
75,"""Timothy 2:11-14
Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.""

Sorry dude, but there is no context in which this is acceptable. The bible quite clearly says that women are less than men and tells them to shut the fuck up. Guy in the post is NOT misinterpreting the bible. The bible just sucks."
76,"Yeah but the bible also tells a woman to obey her husband in all things and places the man as the head of the house without any qualifications or merit. He just has to have a dick.

And we know for a fact that male headship culture is toxic and a proven cesspool for domestic abuse and  paedophilia. And no women should have to obey a man in her own home. That's just disgusting and immoral."
77,He literally got banned from heaven because he thought god was shit at their job
78,"Let's add to that... Even the parts where it doesn't explicitly say ""women stfu y'all are dumb"", it implies exactly that. Starting with Eve and poor Adam who (whom?) was tempted by that SUCCUBUS EVE! But no one says ""poor Eve, she was tempted by the snake"". Eve is seen as weak and that humanity's original sin is the fault of a woman so we must cover our ears when women speak. But men? MEN CAN PART THE SEA! Men are superheroes!"
79,Well. You are misinterpreting that verse as well and trying to make that fit your very narrow window point. There are a lot more verses and context in that massive book and a three verses don’t define the entire picture.
80,"He is the spiritual leader of the house yes. But the fact is the man isn’t just suppose to be making up things as he goes along because he has a dick. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. Not just be some asshole around the house demanding random things. You both have a job and are expected to honor each other respectfully.

That’s a very interesting stance to take. I’m really sorry you have such a cynical outlook on marriage."
81,God is a bad boss.
82,"It's so blatantly obvious that all the ""holy books"" were written by powerhungry and perverted men. Like the shit in the quran where it says a woman's word is worth half that of a man's... So if it's word against word, the man NEVER EVER loses. Always wins. Fucking pathetic."
83,"It says what it says. What is there to misinterpret? Explain it to me. Go on, I'll wait."
84,"No. The bible specifically says women must obey men IN ALL THINGS. Even as a spiritual leader a man isn't given that position on merit or qualifications...purely on having a penis.

And loving a wife as christ loved his church explains why there is so much domestic violence and abuse in christian marriages. Jesus loved his church....and threatened to torture them for eternity if they dont love him back. Jesus was the posterboy for being an arsehole and abuser. Christ's church is a battered bride. 

Demanding a woman obey a man in all things is not honouring her. This isn't marriage. This is moral depravity and the reason why christian marriages and the church are riddled with domestic abuse, rape and paedophilia. Male headship and patriarchal structures have always been destructive to societies and human lives."
85,It is kind of pointless whenever you are as aggressive as you are. I’m just letting you know that you have no idea what you are trying to say quoting a book you don’t understand. And this guy saying women are not equal is wrong as well.
86,You have an extremely elementary understanding of Christianity. I’m sorry you have a very negative outlook on a lot of things. Life isn’t as dark as you make it seem.
87,"So as soon as I ask for some proof, you give up the argument. Almost sounds like you actually don't have any sound evidence so you just make up excuses on the spot. Typical."
88,"This has nothing to do with mine or anyone's understanding of christianity. This is based purely on biblical teachings and observed and recorded christistian practices over the last 2000 years. 

Not sure what this had to do with other things so it's odd that you wish for me to have a negative view ""on a lot of things"". Like what things? 

But I completely understand why you have to fantasise about me being negative ""on a lot of things"" and seeming life is dark even though none of that is even remotely relevant to this conversation. You have just been shown by numerous people who filthy, disgusting and immoral the christian concept of male headship is...especially when men are granted headship with zero merit or qualifications other than having a penis. So now you're upset and lashing put even though it makes you look silly."
89,If that’s how you want to say this went down sure. I’ll just leave this with you- Ephesians 5:22. “Submit to one another because of your reverence for Christ.” Written by Paul who also wrote the letter to Timothy. You and this screenshot need to stop cherry picking what you do not understand.
90,"All you’ve said is negative everything. And you have shown you have a very dark outlook on life. You are trying to make it seem like evil just doesn’t exist in the world even outside of Christianity. You are the one lashing out, very much so. And are who has a fascination of merit with someone and their penis. Kind of odd. Especially odd making it seem like every Christian is some wife beating pedo. So narrow."
91,"This isn't saying a whole lot of ""I do not permit men to have authority over women. They shall remain silent"" though.

AT BEST, what you're doing here is pointing out bible contradictions. You're the cherrypicker."
92,"We are talking about biblical christian marriage. It IS negative. We have spoken about nothing else. Christian biblical marriage isn't an out look on life. Who tf has that as an outlook on life? 

No one said evil doesn't exist outside of christianity. But I understand your christian obligation to be dishonest, lie and strawman what others are saying. 

The only ones with a fascination for penises are the ones who wrote the bible and follow the depravity that his biblical christian marriage who made the only qualification for headship is...to have a penis. No merits, no proven leadership qualifications...just a penis. Not just odd but also disgusting as this method has proven the culture of male headship is rife with domestic violence and paedophilia. Facts are facts and they don't care about your sensitive feels."
93,"You can think that if you’d like. And if you think that is a contradiction you need to reevaluate everything that has been said. All it was, was a reaffirmation that a woman should submit. You have zero understanding of what you are trying to say. Have a good day man."
94,"It’s not negative. Every piece of it is about loving each other mutually. And treating each other with the highest respect. The outlook I’m referring to is the fact you seem to think any household with a strong Christian male touches his children and beats his wife. It’s a poor outlook and childish to think that’s true. 

I don’t know why you are rambling every fallacy you can think of just because I’m telling you and this other guy that you don’t understand what you are trying to talk poorly about. I’m glad you have determined though in your own words to be a man you are born with a penis. And it’s always funny when people quote Ben Shapiro like that means anything negative. You’re right- there are facts in the Bible and you suck at trying to make a point cherry picking from it."
95,"Haha, if you say so, fruitcake"
96,"Except having to obey a man in everything isn't mutual love. No adult should have to obey someone in their own home. That's disgusting and immoral. Commanding someone obey another isnt respectful especially when there are no leadership skills or merit and the job of leadership is based purely on genitals. 

The outlook that a strong christian male touches his kids is YOUR own strawman outlook. No one mentioned the strength of christian men. You did. But again, I completely understand your biblical christian obligation to be dishonest and lie and strawman what people say.

And you do realise Shapiro is Jewish so rejects any facts claimed in the christian New Testament. Espcially the christian threat that husbands must treat their wives like the abusive, hateful and immoral christ treats his church. Shapiro doesn't believe Jesus is a christ or messiah."
97,"I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>There is no doubt that law enforcement should be heavily scrutinizing the membership and administration of mosques.

98,Good luck out in the world kid.
99,"I don't need luck. I live in a country that has a long time ago made biblical christian marriage illegal because it is proven to be harmful to society and the well being of women and children. Hence it is illegal to demand a woman obey her husband as the bible commands. Martial rape as per the bible is illegal. Demanding a woman be silent and not have authority over men is illegal. 

The world isn't the bleak, dark, evil world the bible commands it to be. Civilised nations have broken away from those biblical atrocities and hatred such as male headship and patriarchal structures. hence our crime rates are lower, equality higher, economies better and health and happiness outcomes much higher. 

No luck needed. Just basing our laws and morals on logic, facts and science...not a book written by ignorant men who didn't even know about basic human biology."
100,Gotta love government demands but hate God. Glad to hear you listen to somebody’s rules.
