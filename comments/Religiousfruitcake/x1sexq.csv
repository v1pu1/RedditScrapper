1,"""What do we do now?""

""I guess we go find a bar and get shitfaced.""

""Good idea."""
2,Or when you don't listen to your atheist friend and continue being a religious fruitcake and you both die and.
3,When the Christian’s find out the Buddhists were right and they get reincarnation as a trans woman.
4,"Okay, that's a little funny."
5,"Doesn't really belong here. It's just light-hearted fun. 

Stick to the actual fruitcake content."
6,Okay that's a little funny
7,That's a good meme. Got a laugh out of me
8,You'll be friends in hell and that's what matters
9,"This is just funny, why are people mad about this?"
10,I'm going to casually add my one upvote while sadly noticing the 2485 people in that sub that added fruit to the cake.
11,Come on this meme is funny as hell!
12,Yeah but that’s Dankchristianmemes. It’s actually legit funny. Atleast the old subreddit used to be.
13,"r/dankchristianmemes are usually pretty self aware and light hearted. I wouldn't think too deeply into this, its just silly fun."
14,When someone converts his friend to another theistic religion and they find out both of their religions are false but another one in endless possibilities is true.
15,This doesn’t count as fruitcake. This is just silly fun.
16,"I'm going to just start ""telling religious people"" that Jesus would not want that to happen, it's evil, and Satan has infected that ""idea/sect/right wing idea""   They just are not that smart, and I don't need to convince them anymore.  I'm tired of trying to fix stupid."
17,But the fun party is in hell!
18,"“That’s a lot, Jimmy!”"
19,Just cut it open with the powersaw! Oh wait-
20,You mean dodging an eternity of Bible study?
21,Drake…where’s the door hole?!
22,Not pictured: The panel where they're now partying with all the cool people in hell.
23,Hah. It's rare to see them make good memes
24,"okay, the only thing funny about this is the drake and josh thing, and that makes this a win"
25,I think they are under the section of purgatory. /s
26,"Oh yeah, eternal damnation. The most light-hearted of fun topics. It's hilarious!

 The fact that these people (and you) are so casual about such deeply fucked up doctrine is, in fact, fruitcakery."
27,"I agree, it's funny"
28,"What if they were following the wrong religion and the atheist talked them out of it. That would at least make the real god less mad, right?"
29,You're literally being a fruitcake right now
30,"Calm down, if you keep taking everything so literally it might negatively affect your overall health (and relationships)."
31,"Why do you care about what those weirdoes think, you know its not real"
32,"It depends on personality of real god. Maybe yes, maybe no, maybe it will make no difference."
