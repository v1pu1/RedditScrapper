2,He 100% fucked the fish.
3,If you find me someone who can insert any fingers into their clitoris I will eat the very phone I typed this on.
4,Women feel like trash after masturbating? That's suprising. I feel great after rubbing one out. That is why I do it.

6,"Hell, I'm a gold-star gay guy, and even *I* know it doesn't look like that!"
7,Ok but what if I‚Äôm having sex with men instead
8,"As a woman I have to say that no man who enjoys sex with women would EVER speak negatively about the clitoris. I‚Äôm convinced that 99.99% of satisfying sex starts with even the slightest bit of attention to the clitoris. 

Rant over."

21,"If they feel like trash after masturbating, they are doing it wrong. They need a different kind of education than this fake information."
22,Today I learned the clitoris makes babies.
23,"1- the clitoris can't be penetrated, only the vagina.
2- the vagina is supposed to pass a baby so four fingers is nothing
3- women feel bad after masturbating because of the guilt the patriarchy and society in general has taught little girls.
4- if that's the devil's bell, I bet many women would call him willingly. He sounds more fun than many men."
24,I wonder what they think/feel when they post such obvious lies. Is this not against their godly morals?

36,"On this episode on what women are compared to: Fish.

This here is a class A example of r/nothowgirlswork and r/badwomensanatomy. The only women who feel bad after masturbating are the hyper religious women."
37,"How, uh, how did those holes get there?"
38,Ohh a man who tells me how I feel after a wank... wonderful. Now I can begin to understa...... no couldnt actually get through that. Wazzock. Like men I just feel sleepy. Satisfied and a little bit hungry. Masterbation is healthy.
39,Just say you can‚Äôt make a women cum and get on with your life Mr.Reverendo lol.
40,I'm shocked that the same people who rail against sex-ed are also completely ignorant of how the human body functions.

60,"Oh, so fingers cause stretching but birth is fine?"
61,This sounds like some projection
62,"So when this person says men can't find the clit, do they mean the whole vagina? Are they just confused and put their dick in the belly button?"
63,As someone whose wife just had a biopsy: eew.  I'm guessing he's just looking for a way to re-use his anti-abortion props.
64,I don't think Reverend Daniel passed health class.
65,Some jackass still hasn't located the clitoris.

78,The devil's bell ü§£ü§£
79,"Ohhhh wow, I remember seeing a similar awful post with this same picture, but I believe it was different text. Don't even know where to start with this..."
80,Has it ever occure to them that the reason they feel like shit after the deed is because they were brainwashed in to thinking that way?
81,"Uuuh... what?

That's... that's not how they works, that's not how any of that works?

That guy definitely has no idea what a clitoris is, and I doubt he could even find it..."
82,What about when the baby comes out how does it look the ?
83,"How is babby formed?

89,I didn't realize this sub is for extremely obvious satire.
90,"I‚Äôve seen this one and the one where a ham sandwich is compared to a vagina and I‚Äôm consistently amazed that these guys somehow reproduce. Not because they can‚Äôt find some brainwashed spouse who has convinced herself that this terrible sex for life is ok, but because they somehow are able to figure out how to get someone pregnant"
91,Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs
92,This is obvious satire
93,Reverendo‚Ä¶.. ü§¶üèª‚Ä¶.That‚Äôs not the clit‚Ä¶..

97,The devils bell ‚Ä¶ love that !
98,"Part of me is sure this just HAS to be a Poe.  I know there are lots of stupid people in the world, but go look at the Facebook page.  The profile picture alone screams satire, and when you look at all the posts, there‚Äôs no way this isn‚Äôt satire.  Then I remember that Alex Jones exists, and I‚Äôm no longer certain."
99,"Oh dear, someone is in dire need of an anatomy class!"
