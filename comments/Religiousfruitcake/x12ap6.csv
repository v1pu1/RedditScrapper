1,"""Adelaide, who lives with her mother and **five older brothers**, could not be reached for comment""

poor girl :("
2,"> Adelaide claims that's she has never had sexual contact with a man before

Press x to doubt.

Seriously, is it a coincidence that people claim virgin births where pre marital sex is harshly punished and looked down upon?"

9,"""Well, there was that one week where she went on vacation.., but there's no way it could have been that"".

17,*You could make a religion out of this*
18,"Would like a source for that claim.

If you're thinking of parthenogenesis thats not possible for mammals."
