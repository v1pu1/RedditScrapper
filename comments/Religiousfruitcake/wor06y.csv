1,"Not to mention, if this was in the US, there would be a certain segment of the population that would probably tell him to go back to his own country."
2,Socialist sandal wearing Jew wants to take your money and give it to the undeserving poors
3,Excuse me! A fucking carpenter! Name one thing he built.  One damn thing.
4,"He would be ubiquitously demonized by the establishment.

He went after banks, which represent the de facto head of the oligarchy.

You‚Äôre correct the religious right would go after him. But the Neo-liberal elite would quietly ensure that anyone supporting him was labeled problematic for their ‚Äútable flipping‚Äù antics."
5,"Psst. Jesus was Jewish. 

Pass it on."
6,I mean it‚Äôs not totally wrong it‚Äôs just they‚Äôd hate him we‚Äôd just think he was a lunatic
7,"Christians were hunted because they were a cult.   Nero blamed the burning of Rome on Christians.

So I feel I should add.   Sad they missed them"
8,Wasn‚Äôt he viewed exactly like that by the rabbis in the Bible?
9,"An extremist cult leader who told followers that they must hate their father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters and their own lives, has instructed his followers to arm themselves.

According to reports he told them ""if you don't have a sword, sell some of your clothes and buy one."" Some of his followers are known Zealots, rumored to be violent revolutionaries.

The leader who styled himself as the same as God saying publicly ""If you‚Äôve seen me ‚Äì you‚Äôve seen the Father"" recently attacked merchants at the temple and fled before guards could capture him.

After a paid informant told local authorities his location, the cult leader was arrested and now faces charges of planning an insurrection against the government."
10,"Who do you think the religious experts would be? He was a Jew after all, this could easily be a Fox News headline."
11,"""If Jesus was to preach like he preached in Galillee, they would lay Jesus Christ in his grave."" - Woody Guthrie"
12,True!!
13,I mean tbhs we do have an example look a Bernie sanders he is a socialist Jewish guy who actually used to do carpentry
14,The left would hate him as much as the right
15,"Not to mention, *King* of the Jews. ""I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 1776 Will commence again!"""
16,"According to Passion of the Christ, the fucking chair."
17,these nuts
18,The Bible *did* gloss over 30 years of His life‚Ä¶
19,Crosses?
20,"I mean, he *was* kinda raised as one by one, I guarantee he made something at some point.  It doesn't really have to be remembered to have happened.  Plus, he was about 30 before he started his whole son of god schtick, so he had to do something in that time.

Of course, all this assumes he existed, which he did not."
21,"And, well, that would be pretty close to the truth. Early christianity was a full-on cult."
22,"""were"" a cult???"
23,"unlikely. he was in support of gay people, poor people, fought for them, attacked the wealthy, went after banks, told people to support immigrants as if they were one of your own, didn't judge people for who they were like prostitutes

Jesus of the Bible is legit one of the furthest left figures in history"
24,Yes. And justifiably so.
25,So he is the reason nuts exist ü§î
26,Very weak character development or plot.
27,I don't think he built that.
28,"Uh, even if you‚Äôre not religious, denying that Jesus of Nazareth was a real person who existed is misinformed. Sure, he might not have been Divine, but he at least existed"
29,"We outgrew the definition by couple of hundred million followers since then, and we are a Religion, hehehe"
30,"He was in support of the truth, which automatically disqualifies the left."
31,"Ah ok. He did in The Last Temptation of Christ, which is where I get my Jesus info."
32,"No, it's not.  The only evidence of his existence is written.  And we're not even talking primary sources here - it has the same provenance as saying ""my mate's wife's cousin's friend's dad swears he heard some bloke in the pub talking about some guy who could walk on water.""  We have exactly as much evidence of Jesus as we do of Sherlock Holmes.  The *only* difference is that we know *for sure* that Holmes is fictional."
33,"So, by your admission, the difference between a cult and religion is acceptance?  That's kinda the gist of that comment, from my perspective."
34,"Well religions are a type of cult

A cult is a group of people who have strong veneration towards something e.g. jesus"
35,"yeah, totally, it's the *left* that's gone off their rockers and has a problem with truth"
36,"Wow, Christ built crosses for a living.  Talk about irony."
37,or real estate...
38,"Well, yes, and its penetration in the various societal and govermental institution"
39,"I mean it's actually basically true. The beliefs of mainstream religions aren't actually less bizarre than the beliefs of cults, they've just had centuries of good PR and flowery language to add an air of credibility."
40,Here's a good litmus test for truth: Can a  woman have a penis?
41,the answer is literally yes. you don't even have a basic grasp of biology do you?
42,"Cis women don't have penises.

Trans women may or may not."
43,"It's so funny that this question is all it takes to see if you're dealing with a normal person or somebody totally insane.  
And you have the audacity to talk about truth."
44,Can you elaborate without using made up words?
45,"it's hilarious that you think your complete lack of a basic understanding of biology is a win

just one extremely quick example - people can be born with both a penis AND a vagina. guess what, they get to fucking choose what they are. which means they can be a male with a vagina or a female with a penis

this is just one example of fucking DOZENS that show gender a construct and has dozens of different representations.

 and you're a fucking moron"
46,"All words are made up to describe existing things. So no, I literally can't describe anything if I'm not allowed to use ""made up"" words."
47,"Ah yes the famed 0.02% - 0.05% of people born as intersex. What a gotcha moment that was for you, real proud of yourself there, ain't ya lil buddy?   
Tell me what else you learned about biological extremes and anomalies, bet there's a bunch of fascinating stuff out there nobody but you knows about."
48,Funny that you can't considering you would just need to continue making shit up as you go along.
49,"literally. one. example. of. dozens.

another is born with hormone imbalances that can cause very similar things.

either way, you asked me if a woman can have a penis. the answer is unquestionably yes, and you thinking that's some sort of gotcha makes you an absolute fucking moron

your response to the plethora of different things people can deal with in life is to mock them, call them mentally ill, discriminate and pass laws making their lives difficult

in other words, you and every one like you are just massive pieces of shit"
50,"You're the one name calling, lacking an understanding *basic* biology, and outright denying reality with that fantasy world outlook. You're raging like a toddler because you can't stand that people won't put up with  your idiotic worldview and calling you out on your bullshit.     

You are a child. Like every child, you'll grow up eventually. If you're lucky you'll realize that you're the sole source of your misery and do something about it. But, more than likely, you'll double down on the resentment and remain miserable and eventually die the same way you lived. Reality doesn't fuck around."
