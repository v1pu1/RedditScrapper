1,"Let me get this straight- a giant ark made by a professional construction team consisting of dozens if not hundreds of workers, is damaged by heavy rains. But the ark made by like 10 unskilled craftsmen thousands of years ago was rock solid throughout all the heavy rain and floods?? Okay bro

Edit: I didn‚Äôt read the article before commenting, but it was the road that got damaged and not the ark itself. Regardless, Kent Hovind is still a dangerous and problematic narcissist and I hope he stubs his toe or something idk"
2,"This has been posted a lot in recent years but it‚Äôs wrong 

‚ÄúThe Ark itself, a 510-foot-long model unveiled in 2016 that is based on the Biblical ark in which Noah and his family survived a flood, was not damaged by the rain.‚Äù 

Unfortunate because it would have been funny."
3,"Claim denied under ""Act of God"" clause."
4,"The damage was to an access road and not to the ark itself.

5,Wait a minute...
6,Lol. And I suggest y'all watch the documentary with bill nye. Its fn great.
7,And yea shall thee claim damages against thy insurance for righteous are those who have high limits
8,r/holup
9,We should sue them for taking the bible stories literally.
10,">You can‚Äôt make this stuff up

That's a funny thing to say when that is exactly what you are doing"
11,"This is pretty old, right?  Or did this shit happen again?  Lol"
12,God wills that the ark be damaged lol
13,"*shrugs*

God's plan."
14,They should try praying the rain damage away.
15,Thats funny as fuck
16,Kentucky Fried Fruitcake Ark
17,"Ugh why does this have to be making the rounds again?? It's clickbait. The part that was damaged was a frontage road that hadn't been adequately reinforced, and thus washed out. I used to work there ('16-'19). The Ark itself was fine, and the service vehicles just took a different road to get to the back of the building.

It's fun to sneer and mock, but clickbait like this on a topic that was clearly debunked 3 years ago does nothing but give them persecution fodder. It plays into their narrative that their enemies will do whatever they can‚Äîincluding use false facts‚Äîto discredit them. And in this case, that's true, so it bolsters their claims when they pretend that ‚Äúatheistic‚Äù science does the same thing.

Disclaimer: I hate the Ark Encounter, Answers in Genesis, and everything they stand for."
18,"Kentucky Ken has insurance? 


Sounds like a HUGE lack of faith here hmm?"
19,"These are the fruitcakes who teach their visitors that baby dinosaurs were on the Ark. Lmao. 

We got the dinosaur bones!"
20,Why would they need insurance if everything happens according to God‚Äôs plan?
21,r/nottheonion
22,Apparently those dim which know that insurance doesn‚Äôt cover act of God and they‚Äôre all about God right away do not about gods about grifting
23,This brings me an irrational amount of joy.
24,Three years ago.
25,"If that thing were to ever float, I would love to see what door he planned on using to keep water out lmao. A light windy day will put waves into the thing, if it isn't already at the water line once you load a few critters on it."
26,"Didn't get flood insurance because ""gawd will protect us""?"
27,When a tree limb falls on your car the insurance company will tell you it‚Äôs an act of god and you pay for. I think they should be told the same thing. Also Kentucky resident.
28,This is quite misleading
29,damn theyre roasting themselves
30,Insert obvious comment here.
31,Deus (not really) ex machina I suppose
32,if I see this fucking headline posted one more time I'm gonna lose it
33,"It's like rayeeeeeaaaaaaain on your wedding day...,"
34,Isn't this like...God testing their faith that he will bestow a most magnificent drying event that will restore the grain of the wood to its unwarped glory...or something. Maybe suing the insurance company is actually smiting God? /s
35,"but, you see, noah's ark was protected by GOD so there's no way that could have been damaged /s"
36,[deleted]
37,"The ark itself wasn't damaged. It was the road. By a landslide.

38,"An ark that would have leaked and sunk in rough water.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_(schooner)"
39,"God only asked for one, all others will fail."
40,"Well the ark that existed back then would look nothing like that. There's a good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/sbfr-9US31k) from the British museum about what the Babylonian flood myth ark would have actually looked like. Also, with the flood myth being present over many cultures, I think there may have been some flooding (not exactly the whole world being covered in water)."
41,Okay buddy fruitcake
42,"It was a service road, not the building itself."
43,"No, but it is ironic. And the ventilation issues are still funny"
44,"Yeah, OP almost left out the best part."
45,this is why you dont trust headlines lol. thx
46,This person reads.
47,Still confused how you sue someone for rain.
48,">The owner's of

Literally the first words. I'm not a writer/journalist, nor am I a native English speaker, but come on.

I only included the ""of"" so people know this isn't possessive, because without that it might just as well be the case."
49,Don‚Äôt you know we only read headlines here on Reddit for outrage? Gtfo
50,"Just watched it last night, very good movie"
51,"It's old, and inaccurate."
52,*Drake sounds intensify*
53,very Geico insurance advert
54,But then why isn‚Äôt Kentuckys Noah‚Äôs ark under god‚Äôs protection. These are just a bunch of stupid religious nutcases
55,"Sorry sir, rain is an act of God. Acts of God, are not covered in your liabilities of reality only policy."
56,"Uh oh, someone didn't pray enough. 

Shameful."
57,"Just more proof of HIS righteous divinitousness

Yes I said HIS come at me vegans"
58,"&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|bNSy5TScNDpoOSfC8G)"
59,"‚ÄúIn the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of Kentucky's Noah's ark attraction are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1 million in property damage.‚Äù

Hahahaha"
60,Why are people allowed to be this openly stupid
61,"The Ken Hamm version has a lot of steel reinforcement because using just wood was going to collapse in on itself, even empty. As a result it‚Äôs weight is so great that it would actually sink if dropped in placid waters"
62,"Wow, only crewed by 14 people? Kinda nuts considering the size."
63,"""With a length of 450¬†ft (140¬†m) from jib-boom tip to spanker boom tip...""

Who doesn't love some good nautical terminology?

Also we should all start collectively start calling Kem Ham ""Kevin Pork""."
64,A scooner with 6 masts?! Wtf was/were the engineer(s) thinking?
65,I like this answer the best
66,They would be sueing the insurance company for not covering it
67,It sounded like maybe a landslide had damaged it. Caused by the heavy rains.
68,hey! we like feeling smart when we draw the conclusion that is already implied obviously by the headline
69,r/DraketheType
70,Shouldn't that be all the insurance they need? LOL
71,Obviously because this is just In the image of the prior ship- obviously supernatural Warranties don‚Äôt roll over-lol

73,![gif](giphy|BQUITFiYVtNte)
74,Because freedumbs
75,"I don‚Äôt think weight matters so much as density. 

A light object that‚Äôs denser overall than water is going to sink. A heavy object (i.e a loaded container ship) can still float if it is less dense overall than water.

If this thing sinks in placid waters, then not only are they bad shipbuilders, they also probably fucked up the math somewhere."
76,"Considering the manure output.

The reality of course is that this is an etiological myth."
77,Last gasp of wooden freighters?
78,Right?  Having insurance was a real lack of faith on their part.  ü§£ü§£ü§£
79,Why pay for insurance when you've got God to protect you
80,I guess they should be suing god.
81,![gif](giphy|zIwIWQx12YNEI)
82,I guess so. Wooden warships from centuries before this had better designs.
83,They used the material appropriately.
84,That's true.
