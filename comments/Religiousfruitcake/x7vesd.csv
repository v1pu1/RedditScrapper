1,"Don't let the smell and rotting flesh distract you, he'll be back."
2,"His respawn’s lagging, just give it a minute. Any second now. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaany second now"
3,The depressing thing is they are still keeping his festering corpse in the morgue over a year later instead of fucking burying it already.
4,"The article about the (extremely dead) pastor in question for those wondering:

5,"Let me guess, COVID?"
6,"It’s funny how every generation of Christians believe that the second coming of Jesus will happen within their lifetime. Throughout history they have always believed that the world has been in chaos and the messiah would come any day/month/year, yet he never came —  and still they go on believing."
7,"Many countries in Africa are being easily scammed by religious leaders. We exported slavery to them in many ways, and through religion we've convinced them to remain slaves to our bullshit ideals."
8,"Pastor: ""Fear not my children, like Jesus I shall rise again!""

Narrator: ""He didn't."""
9,"Any... moment now, you'll see that he was right. /s"
10,"Reminded me of how some Orthodox priests here claimed that proof of a sainthood of certain religious figure was that their body did not rot after dying

After looking at many full bodies, hands of saints etc. I literally saw a mummified almost skeletonized remains. Their skin is obviously preserved not to fall off with some oils or whatever.

I saw mummies from 4000 years ago looking more fresh tbh"
11,"If this idiot wakes up,  someone better be ready to double tap him."
12,https://youtu.be/O1pX359pQQQ
13,"Oh he will rise, alright. The yeast will help."
14,Omg how stupid has humanity become
15,"The thing about claiming you can come back from the dead, you're not there for people to call you out on it when they find out you're lying."
16,Y is he still in the morgue over a year
17,/r/maybemaybemaybe.
18,Probably just need to wait longer.
19,His SOUL was resurrected. You missed it.
20,You got this buddy!!  We believe in you!!!
21,Maybe in another 400 days
22,"This is like that whole baptism thing all over again, who fucked up the magic incantation this time?"
23,"His church members be like:

[Chorus: Eddie Munson]

Pastor, wake up

I don't like this

Pastor, wake up

Hey, hello?

Time to wake up, time to wake up

Can you hear me? Wake up, Pastor

I don't like this, Pastor, wake up"
24,You can’t rush these things! People need to be patient. Took me at least 5 years to come back from death. SMH
25,"If this clown comes back, it'll be as a zombie, and EVERYONE knows how you take care of a zombie.

I imagine the scenario like this:

Morgue Worker #1 (MW1): ""Hey, did you hear that?""

Morgue Worker #2 (MW2): ""Hear what?""

MW1: ""Sounded like rustling cloth.""

MW2: ""I didn't hear anything.""

MW1: ""Shhhh! I heard it again.""

(MW1 crosses to refrigerator doors, stage right)

MW2: ""Quit screwing around, we have work to do.""

MW1: ""I swear I heard something.""

(MW1 presses ear against 2 or 3 doors before stopping at a fourth)

MW1: ""It's coming from this one.""

MW2: ""Now I know your messing with me, those people are all dead, and that one has been dead for more than a year.""

MW1: ""Well, I'm going to open it, just to make sure.""

(Cue spoopy music, the sound of the handle slowly being released, all characters stand stock still as the fridge door opens silently on it's hinges.)

MW2: ""See!?, I knew you were messi.......""

(MW1 interrupts MW2 with a blood curdling scream as a partially decomposed corpse latches it's teeth into his neck.)

(MW2, in utter shock, MW2 grabs a nearby bone saw, the high pitch whine pierces through the grunts and gurgles, he lunges towards the abomination and starts to cut into the skull while it continues to chew on the neck of MW1)

(Fade to black)

The zombie war has started..."
26,"Even if he did wake up he'd have to spend a decade in the shower to get rid of the rotting flesh stench. 

If it's anything like getting skunk off then I bet he'd rather stay dead."
27,It's just a flesh wound
28,"I mean there is a lot more humans now then 2000 years ago, so some lag should be expected"
29,See ? Alive ! Wait no... its a spasm
30,Worst ping rate ever...
31,"“the (extremely dead) pastor”

idk why but this gave me a good giggle"
32,"What, for like the last 2000 years? Gotta be the longest running joke ever!"
33,"Tbf, humanity has always been this dumb. Now we have social media to get an amplification of the foolishness."
34,Op linked an article that would help
35,Tis but a scratch.
36,A scratch? You're arm's off
37,No it isn't!...
