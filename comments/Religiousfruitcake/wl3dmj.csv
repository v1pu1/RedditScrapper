1,"Rapture is soon? Lol. How many times have I heard that before? Rapture watchers, prophets, and criers are a dime a dozen."
2,"If overeating is a sin, wait til Jesus sees me doing bukkake!"
3,I think they meant gluttony
4,"Itâ€™s gluttony and i actually agree w it 

Itâ€™s not referring to eating disorders itâ€™s referring to people who take all the food and resources for themselves and leave none for anyone else or those struggling

Basically donâ€™t be stingy

Itâ€™s like those excessive mukbangs where theyâ€™re just covered in grease and cheese lol i donâ€™t like that knowing they donâ€™t need that much food/will throw it away while millions have nothing to eat. Doesnâ€™t sit right w me"
5,I love that they find the need to explain what lust means.
6,"After what Iâ€™ve done, i donâ€™t think even God himself would forgive me even if i believed in them"
7,The glottuny wasnt explicitly food based. Its non hedonism.
8,"Iâ€™m not participating in the rupture, you go ahead and enjoy"
9,"RUMBLING, RUMBLING, ITS COMING, RUMBLING!

BEWARE!"
10,I dont understand why they need to convince everyone else to accept jesus.  Is it like an MLM?  Are there different levels of heaven depending on how many people you converted?
11,Yeah Jesus can suck my dick
12,Please let the rapture happen so all these religious assholes will leave us sinners in peace.
13,If it is...it's the main one they don't keep! ðŸ˜†ðŸ¤¡
14,"Funny that hate is on their list, when they are the ones who hate everyone who isn't a straight white christian POS..."
15,Original is a sin.
16,"This rapture stuff is funny, it's been ""soon"" for more than 3 decades now, that I can remember."
17,Overeatingâ€¦.so weâ€™ve forgotten the word gluttony
18,"Overeating or overdrinking, better known as gluttony is a sin because it is wasteful of the food and drink given to us by God."
19,"Literally, the whole you won't get to heaven just by being a good person line is not the selling point they think it is just going to say that. Really it just shows how much God wants to be worshipped and praised and apparently, that's all God cares about while God literally does nothing. This mindset literally is the idea that serial killers like Jeffery Dhamer are in heaven because they accepted God but most of Dhamer's victims are most likely in hell because they were gay not all of them but a number of them yes."
20,It was supposed to happen in the lifetime of the disciples. I'm pretty sure we can call sham by now.
21,Apparently the rapture has been just around the corner for decades if not centuries.

23,Have you read the Bible? He's done waaaaay worse
24,"Oh definitely. Of course, like theyâ€™ll ever learn that."
25,"On google it says that Christians believe gluttony to be a sin and some believe it is one of the seven deadly sins. Iâ€™ve never read the bible as Iâ€™ve never been a bible believer lol but on google it says the bible mentions it repeatedly 

In Islam gluttony is also considered haram and bad"
26,Then maybe there could be some hope
