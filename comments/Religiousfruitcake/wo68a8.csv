1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Wow, for the first time in recorded history, religion was used as an excuse to kill."
2,Are they claiming all Muslims without exception want to kill Rushdie?
3,The religion of peace wants some people dead.
4,Islam - the most backwards and deluded cult on this planet
5,"According to this religion, me, all member of this subreddit and Rushdie needs to be unalived no matter what. And the attack will be rewarded by Allah in afterlife."
6,"""The post doesn't include hate… This proves that OP must be an imposer and can not be a Muslim"""
7,Religion of peace everyone
8,the fact that reddit is ok with murderers having a sub is pretty wild
9,How do you prove someone isn't Muslim? Do Muslims have some kind of Muslim ID that they get on birth or when they convert to Islam? I don't see how someone not being a Muslim could be provable in any way.
10,"Guys…they *were* masquerading as a Muslim.

Literally look at their profile."
11,"Muslims believe in freedom of speech, only the speech they agree on. Otherwise you will be killed in the name of Allah the invisible."
12,"So fucking sick of religion. 

On par with mental retardation. Cant change my mind."
13,This sub has lost its braincells. All you have to do is see OOP’s post history to see that they **were** masquerading. They literally give us so much to put on this sub and this is what y’all choose?
14,You aren't a REAL Muslim unless you want to kill the guy
15,"My thought too, the post tried to be as non-problematic as possible.. then again, searching Rushdie on that sub you'll see the general attitude towards this whole thing. Not all Muslims may be THIS deranged but those that aren't def aren't speaking up."
16,"No, they checked the OP's profile and he's clearly an atheist."
17,No they checked the OOP's profile history. He's very clearly an atheist who was pretending to be a Muslim on that post.
18,"All in the name of peace, brother 🙏🙏"
19,"Its for the greater good bro you don’t understand

Its peace if everyones dead"
20,Mashallah 🙌🙌
21,"They're just a bit worse than Christianity to be honest, and only because Christianity colonised the shit out if them, stopping them from having the same secular revolutions that Europe went through."
22,"All religions are banes to humanity and should be done with, but yes, you're correct. The people posting there will likely advocate for our deaths. Fucking bonkers."
23,"Reddit when r/2balkan4u exists: die

Reddit when people want someone to die over a book: i sleep"
24,They went in their post history and checked and apparently they identified as an atheist
25,I wasn't doing a deep dive lmfao
26,"Didn't some cultural leader somewhere put sort of a ""curse"" on him saying every muslim seeing him is obliged to kill him?"
27,"> but those that aren't def aren't speaking up.

nah, evidently they're just getting banned."
28,"Well it's Reddit, so everything's worse."
29,Not the point. He didn't say anything antagonistic or disrespectful and they banned him outright because he isn't Muslim. All he did was ask a question respectfully and that just showed people's backwards attitudes on that sub.
30,"Yes. Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, which is basically a law that covers the entire religion and cannot be reversed, for all Muslims to kill Rushdie."
31,Some shit. Just baffles me this is normal and acceptable behavior. You have a problem with people calling out your delusional bullshit then go literally anywhere that doesn't protect free speech and enjoy
32,The original asshole Ayatollah IIRC.
33,I take it you speak from experience?
34,You can save your argument. I was only answering the question.
35,"He can get fucked and go straight to jail

Tolerance is enabling them"
36,"Even Cat Stevens was into it!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat\_Stevens%27\_comments\_about\_Salman\_Rushdie"
37,They want only their speech to be protected.
38,Ayatollah assaholah
39,"https://old.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/wo68a8/they_serious/

good post showing the problem"
40,"A bit late for that, he died in 89"
41,Lol
42,"Allah be like - Oopsie, took out the wrong guy..."
