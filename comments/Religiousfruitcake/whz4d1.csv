1,"The mixed fabrics thing is actually a pretty big hole in their logic, and their refusal to address it as such is further proof that these people really aren’t the brightest."
2,"There are more nuanced versions of these arguments that are good, but only in context. Yeah of course it's stupid when you remove context and say it with funny grammar"
3,"Perfectly valid arguments against theism. This stinks of ""yeah but apart from *those* arguments, you've got nothing."" Notice they're not being countered, just mocked."
4,This is fucking 3rd strawman i seen today
5,You gotta hit em with something new. Satan tried to overthrow God because God is cruel and megalomaniacal as we see in the old testament. Satan wanted people to think for themselves and to embrace their humanity. So God banished Satan and published propaganda to keep the people obedient. The reality is that Hell is where you will be greeted with love and compassion and Heaven is where you will be greeted by a dictator who will forever punish you for not loving him enough.
6,"Seriously? No adressing the valid objections, and coming only with worthless mockery?

Like, yea, ""Which God lol""! It is a perfectly valid question. These peabrains know that they can't defend their actual position, so they instead defend a much more defensible deism without actually saying it in hopes that the other side won't notice. 

They take advantage of the pervasive abrahamic cultural norms and equalise their very specific bronze age blood god with the hypothetical intelligent creator deism puts forward. They equalise their God, Yahweh, with the very concept of a god.

It's just scummy and frustrating."
7,"I mean literally the first one is probably the most sound argument against any all powerful, all knowing, and all good being."
8,"“Which god?” is a perfectly cromulent argument. 

The first commandment says to worship no other gods. That implies there must be other gods. If there weren’t, there would be no need to make it a commandment. 

And when they say Zeus doesn’t exist, then they understand how I feel about their god."
9,"“Jesus was a socialist”
Well what the fuck was he then excuse me LOL"
10,"""J wasn't in alphabet"" what is that referring to? The scene in Indiana Jones?"
11,"My go-to argument on evolution with a Christian is “if god created humans, why do our bodies have so many flaws?”

Then i give them 30 seconds to answer"
12,"""Which God lul"" is a pretty good question though"
13,“I just made a meme where your argument is spelled funny. I win”
14,The problem of evil (aka “y bad thing”) is something they can’t handle.
15,You have to remember that the religious aren't talking to us. They are talking to each other in a giant religious circle jerk. Whether any of it is true or not doesn't matter. It's all designed to keep them satisfied and handing over their money to the church.
16,"As dumb as those questions seem, I’m still waiting for evidence based answers to some of these questions without the ad hominem fallacy implicit in the grammar and spelling errors. Answer the questions, rather than mocking the people asking them."
17,Ya no one says this stuff ever. We use the logic that drove us away from cult n crazy to explain our choices to leave.  They don't even hear it. No one has left a church for the reasons cited in these files ... they got close tho. If God is real y ur churchie butt so ugly
18,Ok but Jesus actually was a socialist according to the Bible. Mf literally flipped banker’s tables
19,the problem is that the person who made that meme cannot counter half of these
20,">Mixed fabrics

Jews: I'm 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
21,"I'm sure that the ""which god?"" Argument is made by non-christian theists."
22,Ohh so this was posted a a Jehovah's witness i see.
23,"Atheists can't do much to destroy christianity, christians are doing it just fine already"
24,"I used ""if god is real and loves all, then why do babies die, and if it's to spare them from suffering, then why do people still suffer so much?"" When I was in highschool. Made me atheist because everyone had some bs answer that didn't logically make sense. They have their purpose and their place."
25,"""if god fake, y book?"""
26,"If god reel y pp touch feel good made me lol

But honestly though if I was a super being I wouldn't make the thing I detested so easy to do"
27,"In other words, once again theists b\*tching how atheists shouldnt be allowed to use arguments theists have no counter for,  so theists are going to mock and belittle and misrepresent the arguments

Here is a thought little theists, stop forcing your religion on unwilling others and atheists, and said atheist wont have to give you the reasons for why they dont want to join your god cult you are incessantly forcing on them"
28,"These are all sound arguments, I’d like to make one change: 

If god reel, y priests touch little boi pps?"
29,i hear those questions all the time just not coming from a baby
30,And all of these arguments from atheists inevitably come after a Christian belittles them for their lack of belief or tries to convert them after it has been made clear the atheist doesn’t want to be converted.
31,It's easy to beat strawmen because they don't fight back.
32,"Yeah let’s start with that first one at the bottom there, got an answer for that one?"
33,"Mixed fabrics and pork I see brought up in response to Leviticus to show their hypocrisy and cherry picking.

Jesus being a socialist is in response to the hyper capitalist Christians.

Which God is brought up because the evidence they use doesn't actually point to their religion alone.

And the Problem of Evil is still never adequately answered."
34,"The why so many gods is a good icebreaker for any debate, because when you start tracing religion in history you can see the same stories being ripped off and rewritten. It is pretty clear that whatever story they are peddling now isn't even close to the original, and the original they themselves will call bullshit."
35,"“Which god lol”

Yeah, good point! Which god? Zeus? Thor? Hades? Ceaser? This needs to be adressed before I even consider Christianity seriously"
36,"reject religion

# return to monke"
37,"Several are actually quite good, which is why they're trying to reduce them here."
38,"""Jesus was a socialist ""

And how's that bad?"
39,"In Christianity, homosexuality bad, incest gangbang with mother (Eve) to create humans, good"
40,"Jesus was a socialist by practice, that’s not an atheist argument"
41,"Jesus may not have been a ""socialist"", but how does anyone read the Bible and think he would be a gun-toting, ""Fuck them poors!"" conservative Republican today? Just shows how many so-called ""Christians"" have actually read the fucking thing."
42,Counterpoint atheists are trying to *save* Christianity. They're the irrational destructive death cult with the self fulfilling prophecies. We're the cooler heads advocating for a sustainable society.
43,I love pointing to Acts 5 and getting them to explain how Peter isn't a cult leader executing people for not handing over money
44,monkee
45,The pp argument is the best.
46,"Lol *if god reel y am I ugly?*

More like if god real why are YOU ugly?"
47,Call God into court as a witness.
48,"Idk man, touch pp feel good is a pretty solid case against the big man"
49,"I mean ""which god"" is a funny argument and ""mixed fabrics"" is quite valid against people arguing in favour of the old testament in order to be homophobic and stuff."
50,Y touch pp feel good?  This is the universal question we need the answer to…
51,"These are all valid questions.


**None of which has ever been given a straight answer by your ""faith""**"
52,"The ""if god is real then why touching pp feels good"" killed me not gonna lie"
53,"But some of these are valid points. 

The first two from the bottom are pretty hard arguments to make."
54,"""Jesus cared about the poor and sick"" STOP TRYING TO DESTROY CHRISTIANITY!!!"
55,"Jesus was a communist, change my mind"
56,"I don’t get it, how can you believe in god and not be paranoid. There is this omnipresent omnipotent being, that knows everything, and willingly makes people suffer. And people love that idea?"
57,"""Which god, lol"" will always be a personal favorite, lol. Also ""mixed fabric"" and ""shellfish"" are the most valid responses to anti-gay Leviticus quotes."
58,"To give an actually good version of ""Which god? lul"", I'll quote Tim Minchin, ""Fuck me Sam, what are the odds! That of history's endless parade of Gods, the one you just happened to be brought up to believe in is the actual god and he digs on healing?"""
59,“If god reel why bad thing” is quite the way to characterize the field of study of Theodicy.
60,"tbh some atheists are just jerks to anyone who is religious. some, not all."
61,"I mean, most of these are valid arguments when not written to look intentionally silly. It's perfectly valid to bring up The Problem of Evil, the hypocrisy of ignoring passages on mixed fabrics while enforcing rules from the same book of the Bible, the story of genesis being provably wrong, etc.

It's literally responding to criticism by mocking someone like a toddler, instead of addressing anything being said. Pulling a ""teH skehy iz bluu"" to try to make a valid argument look less valid is just childish and kind of embarrassing."
62,"I just fall on the side of “does this impact my day to day life?”

Does being an atheist or being religious matter in my day to day life? Nope, the only time it effects me is when religious loons vote in policy that directly effects my life and family and income.

Atheists never do that to me so I don’t care, and I don’t care about Christian’s until they get political, then fuck them they need to get back in their place and stop trying to lord over the rest of us who are just trying to make a living"
63,I’ll admit I’ve seen quite a few Atheist use these.
64,"I hear ""Jesus was a Socialist"" pretty often, its a very good song from the Reagan Youth (only they say Communist/Pacifist). And frankly I read him more as an anarchist, but I can see the argument to be made for socialist."
65,I hear 3 and 6 quite frequently
66,J wasn't in alphabet?
67,monkee
68,"It baffles me how religious people think there is some great debate to be had on the existence of their god

Bro. These are FAIRYTALES written thousands of years ago. Of course theyre fiction"
69,"I mean… Jesus *was* a socialist. If the biblically-accurate Jesus came back, modern Republicans would burn him at the stake for advocating for such things as helping others and showing compassion."
70,"Same energy as ""I'm going to depict you as a soyboy wojak Dante!"""
71,My enemy is so easy to defeat when they are made of straw
72,Their belief structure is basically at that level.
73,"Is the original pic from SpongeBob , Adventure Time or something else?"
74,Real athiest don’t care Christians exist. They only care when you make them follow Christian logic despite it having nothing to do with science or life.
75,I died at Jesus was a soychalist
76,"The one I got today related to the second law of thermodynamics, and how we as a species evolved from pond scum."
77,Did they just made fun of the super important philosophical debate of the problema of God💀
78,I'd put mopney on this being satire for the purpose of getting likes.
79,"It is a good point though, if there’s an all powerful and all loving god, why is there still evil? You could argue that Adam and Eve sating the apple first introduced sin, but Jesus was supposed to have died to negate that fact"
80,So they’re just lampshading now?
81,Monkee term can be used for Hinduism's Hanuman as well. Coz he's a Monkee
82,"The ""if god real y bad"" is specifically for  proving that it is not possible to a god be ""all knowing all loving and all-powerful"" and for nothing else. And is it mostly a deism thing. ""Yeah there's is a god but not in like your stories he is a dickhead "" argument. They straw-man it hard."
83,"""If no god, then murder good.

If no god, y thing beautiful?

If no god, y logic?

Life no make itself, so god make life

If no god, y bible say there is god?"""
84,"The J thing: ""Jesus"" is an English corruption of a Latin corruption of a Greek corruption of the Hebrew ""Yeshua"" 

In the case of Greek its because names ending in S are masculine while names ended in A are feminine, so that had to change. There were also a bunch of sounds in it that aren't in Greek."
85,"I mean...I do hear atheists use these arguments. Quite a bit in fact. Granted, they're usually more eloquent than OP describes."
86,abort christ
87,monkee
88,"These are all solid points, religious people just don't like that the ideology they base their entire life on falls apart under the slightest scrutiny."
89,"Still waiting on their answers to these...

Dodging the question by saying it's dumb doesn't mean you win"
90,"I guess they'd rather hear that Jesus was a Capitalist, instead? How in the hell would hearing that Jesus  would hold views closer to socialism be an atheist rebuttal against the Bible?"
91,"The thing is some of them are good, they're strategy is to make the question a non issue by reducing how serious it would be taken by trying to make it look dumb"
92,"Forgot: ""I just believe in one less god than you do."" I say it all the time."
93,"They act like these aren’t solid arguments (for the most part, at least) but they can’t really refute any of them."
94,Christians making up arguments atheists use as strawmen because most of them can't win arguments against (or even debate well with) actual atheists*
95,The only two that make any sense are the top two
96,"""Which God?"" ... maybe I'm at the ""kindergarten level"" but as an agnostic this seems to be the most relevant argument, bar none. Why believe in any one of the infinite number of potential explanations of the unknown or the unprovable? Where proof is lacking, given that a lack of disproof is insufficient grounds for certain belief, it is only prudent to remain agnostic.

Atheism is putting faith in the conclusion that because we can make up fantastic explanations about the unknown means that no fantastic explanation could possibly be true. So, in trying to weigh my credences in anything based on how predictable or demonstrable any explanation happens to be, I've found that certainty (in belief or disbelief) about what is unpredictable or undemonstrable is not warranted."
97,"I love that Jesus being a socialist would destroy Christianity. If you read the Bible the things he preaches would fall more into socialism. 

Literally said rich people were going to hell and give up what you had to those less fortunate as the only thing you needed was god. Love thy neighbor as thyself. Etc. not exactly gonna be a fucking venture capitalist with that logic."
98,“It’s out of context”
99,I don't know what it is could you please tell me?
100,"""That was in the Old Testament. It doesn't apply!""

*proceeds to use Old Testament to justify bigotry*"
