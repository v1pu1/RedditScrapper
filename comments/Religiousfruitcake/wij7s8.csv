4,Why have you crossed out queer?
5,"""Dear heathens, I'm going to define 'queer' in the most self-serving way possible and use it to shame you into conforming to a lifestyle I approve of. Stop with the 'strawman' arguments! I'm not made of straw. Where did you get that idea?"""
6,"See what I don’t get about this is how can you type this much just for the sake of being homophobic because god or whatever? Just let me be gay, and this is the reason I don’t do drag or wear feminine clothes cause I just can’t stand this kinda stuff. Like, mind your own fucking business."

15,Ah okay
