1,So much peace bro.
2,What is infuriating is these muslims don't even know what is in rushie's book to be mad about!
3,Don’t love her but wtf
4,"Regardless of how anyone feels, sending death threats is never okay. Unless it were Hitler. Fuck that guy"
5,Jihaddus makeuppus!
6,Muslims always get so mad about books and cartoons.
7,Hareem potterudin :- The order of Muhammad
8,Find who issued the death sentence and get them
9,I will never tolerate Islam.
10,"First of all, Jeez.

Second of all, what in the fruitcakery is happening in these comments???"
11,I couldn’t care less about Rowling but wow.
12,[removed]
13,How the amount of trans hating people just had to show up.
14,"I don't like this woman, but receive death threats for support Salman Rushdie kind of erases her transphobia.

Congratulations muslims, you made it me agree with J. K. Rowling."
15,[removed]
16,"Religious ideas are a detriment to a peaceful, improving society."
17,Smooth brain who lives under a rock here; what’s this about?
18,"""Harry Potter and the threat of the desert"""
19,She is not even a Muslim - the fu_k did these extremists take?
20,"I don't like J.K Rowling either but for an entirely different reason. +, I don't feel the need to send death threats to people."

23,"She's not the best person, but this is extreme. People should be able to write books without being marked for death"
24,Lol look at all the little TERFS buzzing around like mosquitoes in here.
25,"Hey, look at that, the one time that JK Rowling isn't a hateful, ignorant bigot promoting and defending white supremacist talking points and she gets death threats for it. Ironic."
26,"After years of being a transparent bigot, JK Rowling finally does something based and receives death threats for it.

Guess it's safer to be a transphobe than be opposed to fucking death fatwas."
27,"Oh no! 

Anyway...."
28,"Rowling is trash for transphobia but I would never wish death on her…on anyone on that matter. 
I hate what’s she’s become but she still part of my childhood. 
Islam…pEaCeFuL religion my ass"
29,"Gonna drop this here while I still can:

1. I do not believe Rowling hates transgender people. I have simply not seen enough evidence to conclude this, especially considering that she has [stated](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269407862234775552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1269407862234775552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=) quite clearly that she support transgender people. I would love to see someone provide some actual evidence of this claim, seeing as how she's become so violently polarizing. 
2. As a secular community, we can't be hypocritical about freedom of expression and the freedom to offend. If Rowling's opinions offend you, you should ask yourself why you're offended. You should hope to defend her free expression as much as anyone else's, because that's how we can make a society immune to authoritarianism.
3. This thread is almost certainly gonna get closed soon. I would like to think that the secular community is beyond some of the grotesque comments that one can find in this comment section (assuming they don't get deleted). If not, that's a real shame."
30,"The islamic use of the word ‘peace’ is archaic. Yes, you can terrify a population into peace. However, we have expanded the breadth of peace, hail satan, to include mental anguish. 

Or at least great swathes of the world has. Some locations and groups are lagging behind and weighing down our general advancement as a species"
31,"Come on, this is lies!! Islam is peaceful, the media is making Muslims look bad!. It's the only peaceful religion around... After we slaughter and murder you!👿"
32,"oh no

anyways"
33,So many jk stans sucking her asshole in these comments. Fuck her. oh no a rich tranphobic piece of shit got threatened online .couldn't give less of a shit tbh about her well-being is zealots murdering people ok? Obviously not but I'll never pretend to care if she gets hurt.
34,It’s hard to feel pity for a transphobe.
35,"The amount of knee jerk responses to JK Rowling is mind blowing. I doubt a single one of you have actually read what she has to say. You can disagree with her but throwing ""hate"" and ""transphobic"" at every person that disagrees with you is fucking fascist behavior."
36,"Oh no! 

Anyway...."
37,"Oooh, this is getting interesting. I'm making popcorn."
38,"Well if the Islamic extremist knew how conservative she is and her outspoken views on trans people, they’d probably quite like her and would let the SD support slide. Lol"
39,I hope she’s okay
40,"The three main stars who played Harry, Ron, and Hermione aka The THREE Who Shall Not Be Named:  Dead silence, crickets chirp."
41,"Man, I'm torn on this one.  Obviously this is fucking absurd - she should be in danger for her *transphobia*, not for legitimately decent actions like supporting a fellow writer who was viciously attacked."
42,I never knew radical trans activists and fundamentalist muslims would agree on something
43,The transphob dosnt deserve to feel safe
44,"Eh, they can have her. She’s a whole entire asshole."
45,Isn't one of the Prophet's teachings to not attack women?
46,"I’m gonna be downvoted for this but — good. She’s obnoxious. Hopefully she feels some of the fear that trans people are feeling for the threats and abuse they’re receiving, increasingly, due to her validating hatred and disguising it as feminism."
47,She must be thinking .. wait but I am liberal. How can they attack me?!?
48,Islamic Extremists and TERFs. At least they agree on something. Let 'em duke it out.
49,True hero’s
50,She burnt a few bridges so that many of us are justified in not caring what befalls her.
51,"It took about 35 years to assault Salman Rushdie, so she's probably okay."
52,De-portio !
53,Can I get a r/outoftheloop on this guy?
54,I hate. J.K. rowling but THIS is too much.
55,whos salmon rushie
56,Guy is a Pakistani.
57,Bunch of liberal loonies will probably support this it we won’t ever tell them off because.... you know
58,I’m confused do we hate islamophobia or Islam?
59,"Liberals about to come in here screaming, ""iSlAmOPhoBiA!!!"""
60,It’s so mooslim.
61,"So one guy gives a death threat… and here we are blaming an entire religion and over a billion people.

*facepalm*"
62,"I believe there’s an alternate type of peace that is where nobody is fighting each other because there’s a very credible threat of violence from a governing authority if they do misbehave.

In that case, you could technically call Islam a religion of peace."
63,One peace here and other there.
64,"It’s ok, they’re not true Muslims anyway 🤡🤡"
65,*Feminist* peace.
66,They don't need to....72 male virgins not gonna quiz them in heaven.
67,"she’s an ass, but this is fucking way too much. just call her Gay K Rowling and make memes about her"
68,"Yeah, same.

She's repugnant but doesn't deserve *this*"
69,Right ? I don't like her either but I'm not gonna send her death threats
70,"I’m not a fan of Rushdie, either. No one deserves what happened to him."
71,I love her. What's not to love? She is a great author and a defender of free speech.
72,"I'm asking myself if it's ok to think this;  but perhaps having something real to worry about is better than making up imaginary issues with trans folks. 

Doesn't imply I'm happy she was threatened, she's not nice but I don't d€athtoyou people"
73,"She's quite used to death threats by now, I'm sure. Not that they're okay, but one more won't hurt her"
74,Hitler sent himself a death threat. And followed through
75,"Well, she IS an antisemetic pos who has managed to brainwash a bunch of people into thinking her way of thinking is correct, published a bunch of books with racist, sexist and antisemetic undertones in the guise of a different genre… so… are we really that far from the mark here? Lol where is the line drawn?"
76,Or unless it’s the guy that sent the threat. Fuck that fuckin guy
77,Or you are Putin.
78,Their religion reduces them to children with no self control on such matters.
79,"I don’t see the distinction between that and the fear mongering, hate, pedophilia, and incest in the Hebrew Bible (Torah/First Testament) and Christian Bible (+ New Testament). It’s all hocus pocus locust mumbo jumbo."
80,"This is a shitty sentiment. I know plenty of Muslims who are wonderful people and wouldn't hurt a fly. Islam isn't the problem, religious extremism and nationalized religions are."
81,"Same, religion for sensitive assholes 🤦"
82,"Muslims can be okay, but enough of them aren’t that it kinda ruins it. 

Hijabi cosplayers are the bomb tho"
83,Fuck off you hateful prick
84,"Also love all the misogyny and the glee for violence and bloodlust in this comment section. So many are actively cheering for this SOB to kill her in religious fruitcake sub and many who think it’s warranted and deserved. As someone who’s following Rushdie’s story for some time, I can say there’s no difference between the loonies who think he deserves death for his stupid writing and those who retort to gross misogyny and violence for her terfiness. Some of you here are no different from those who think Salman’s fatwa was deserved."
85,So many JK Rowling fans not understanding the irony of what they’re saying!!! Wild!!!
86,"I mean, yeah she's a POS, but no one deserves to die for their personal beliefs... (as long as it doesn't affect others in a bad way)"
87,"Best bet is to hope they have a reformation and become as neutered religiously as Christianity, don’t hold your breath though."
88,"I’m so disappointed in this sub here - the amount of people defending that hatefilled white suprepacists transphobe is alarming… I thought most people here were you know, against the kind of shit she spews out, which seems pretty closely aligned with Christian hate speech to me so I’m confused af!"
89,"Ehhh… she did something good, but it doesn’t erase her transphobia."
90,I have no issue with J. K Rowling she is entitled to an  opinion it's called the freedom of speech in a democratic society whether you agree with her or not.  My concern is people going around trying to destroy careers integrity and life because they are intolerant of other opinions that I don't agree with. It is dangerous for everyone to suppress speech and democracy by the use of threats and violence
91,It won't stop with Rushdie or Rowling the list will go on just  buy association alone
92,Same exact argument goes for “Christians” though too. People ignore 90% of their book. It’s why it’s all complete bullshit.
93,"Even the “nice and progressive” Muslims won’t call out religious violence, in fact the vast majority have a passive respect and desire for it. There are no nice and progressive Muslims."
94,Well I guess there’s hardly any religious people at all then.  Why do you even need this sub with your definition.
95,Your comment or post was removed because it expressed bigotry.
96,Just say islam.
97,"She was threatened for showing concern for Salman Rushdie, an author who was [attacked](https://time.com/6205909/salman-rushdie-attacked-violent-threats/) over  a book he wrote 35 years ago which pissed off islamic extremists."
98,It's not whether someone is a Muslim or not. It's more of someone supporting a blasphemer or not. It doesn't matter who that is.

100,"Spreading bullshit videos of how ""kind and respectful"" they are."
