1,I imagine they'd be surprised to learn that \~29% of South Koreans are Christian.
2,Remember that having fun is apparently bad.  Fucking puritan scum.
3,"I'm neither a K-pop fan or Christian but I'm also at a loss as to how they're incompatible. Feels like the OP is just juxtaposing random things, like...

* You can't be a Muslim and like Frosted Flakes.

* You can't drive a Subaru and be a Buddhist.

* You can't be a Mormon and use an iPhone."
4,"I'm really curious what they're implying here, like what are they gettin at. I need an explanation."
5,Had to send that to my friend who is a huge kpop fan
6,Want to stump a Christian? Ask them what a Christian is
7,"I could kinda see why Christians would be against celebrity worship and pop idols, but why specifically K-Pop? It's just music."
8,"We will have no false idols!

*has a trump hat, shirt, bumper sticker, flag, makes memes attempting to make him look physically attractive*"
9,"Stan? More like SATAN, amirite?"
10,You must make a choice. I chose kpop years ago and I stand by that choice.
11,let me guess.. satanic ?
12,"Ladies, gentlemen and non-binary individuals, may I present the 2022 equivalent of, “IF YOU LISTEN TO TWISTED SISTER AND MOTLEY CRUE YOU’RE IN LEAGUE WITH THE DEVIL!” Same Satanic Panic, different outer trappings."
13,"There are Christians who live in Korea. Can't they like what, for them, is just local popular music? This seems odd."
14,"So like \*Footloose\*, but both dancing and music are banned?

I wonder if they're similarly against western pop music, or if this is more a matter of racism than just being puritanical."
15,Do these people do anything fun? They sound like the kid who would get mad at their classmates for talking when the teacher is out of the class just because they have nobody to talk to.
16,"> There is no such thing as a christian

They're sooooooo close..."
17,"**To the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, “I am A.R.M.Y.” They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good. **

Isaiah 59:2"
18,"Music is bad! Now come to church and sing our depressing, off-key music."
19,Haha I knew Christians would start complaining about K-pop soon. I’m an atheist but my Muslim family tells me how haram K-pop is daily.
20,"I know I’m the surface this is another satanic panic thing with K-pop being incredibly popular right now, but I can’t help but feel some racist undertones as well. White Christians love saying anything that come from a culture that isn’t theirs is inherently wrong."
21,Heaven forbid you have a life outside of the bible. /s
22,I don't see what the big deal is. K-POP is just N-Sync and Destiny's Child in a Korean package.
23,"I mean, at this point I’m pretty sure you could add any noun to the end of “There’s no such thing as a Christian…” and there’d be at least one fruitcake defending that point of view.

There’s no such thing as a Christian Democrat.
There’s no such thing as a Christian SJW.
There’s no such thing as a Christian lawnmower.
There’s no such thing as a Christian banana pudding."
24,"I always find it funny how flexible “Christian values” are, it always seems to fit the worldview of the person speaking even though it all comes from the same book. 


“And the Lord said unto Moses: fuck K-Pop”"
25,"Haaa, right wingers thinking a Christian kpop fan being made to choose between the two will pick Christianity.  Ha"
26,I would like to think that the human rights issues in k poo are the reason the Karen is up in arms but it’s highly unlikely
27,... ... ... why?
28,this looks like a shitpost but i know that it’s not
29,"I mean, I would choose living, dancing, hot boys over a dead Jesus any day."
30,"I don't really know much about K-pop but I'll give it try now. If Christian's hate it, that's generally a good sign."
31,"Thank god, I am a Hindu KPop Stan 😎💪"
32,And then they wonder why so many people are leaving the Church seeing as you can't do anything and be a Christian apparently.
33,"This reminds me of back in the 80's people were like ""metal is satanic"", and nowadays there's Christian metal. That's for some reason funny to me"
34,Those are the two worst things
35,Well they have at least one thing in common. Both promote fanaticism and are absolutely useless.
36,"Until they start making super shitty Christian k-pop.  Go ahead, think they won’t do that shit. I dare you"
37,"bro, im christian and have been in k-pop for abt a year now, what’s wrong with that lmao"
38,unless you live in a country where christianity is spelled with a K...and there is such a thing as christian pop...
39,Didn't know they made Christian K-pop...seems like a very niche genre.
40,Yeah. K-pop Stan is an asshole.
41,"That could be true, but you could be a sexual predator and a Christian at the same time."
42,This looks like fucking inspirobot
43,Huh?
44,Why because they’re Asian?
45,"I like to imagine this coming from a K-Pop fan, trying to convert their friend to K-Pop."
46,"Feel like this should be said, you shouldnt like kpop either way. You can enjoy the music of course, but the industry behind it involves literal slave labour, and the suicide rates are enormous."
47,Put it on the list with hardcore gamers and LotR fans.
48,It sucks to be christian. These people can’t even have music. 🤦‍♀️
49,[Korean Jesus Saves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8MZGr5YQ1Y)
50,"Okay, first off, I know a black guy who's a pastor and a kpop fan. And may have a decided Asian fetish. So..."
51,"K pop is cool… for its fans I guess. 

I hate it.

Christians are fucking lame, not all on an individual level, but how much time before we kick their theocratic authoritarian stranglehold on the world into the dirt with the nazis and commies?"
52,"""If you're christuan you're not allowed to enjoy anything!""  What a stupid religion."
53,Follow no fake idols lol /s
54,That’s a new one
55,Says who LMAO?!
56,Someone's never seen [Korean Jesus](https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/amp_metadata_content_image_min_696px_wide/public/2016/12/23/korean_jesus.jpg?itok=3YAGwiIV)
57,Ok and
58,r/gatekeeping
59,…What? What the… I have no words. The gatekeeping… the stupidity…
60,"damn now i'm even more of a sinner

what's next? drinking juice?"
61,How to stan LOONA in a God-honoring way
62,im kpop fan
63,"Truthfully, Evangelical weirdos creep me out less than weebs do. Ill take a 20 yr old, male Christian Nationalist over a 20 yr old male K-Pop fan any day of the week.

They both make my skin crawl but at least I understand the Christian Nationalist. It is like Walter's line in The Big Lebowski, 

"".. ~~Nihilists~~ K-pop? Fuck me. Say what you about the tenets of ~~National Socialism~~ Christian Nationalism, Dude, at least it is an ethos.""

edit- This was said in jest but it was truthful. The fact that there are so many weeb creepos makes my skin crawl."
64,"Sez who? Somebody die and made you Pope? 

Fuck off."
65,Saw this post from a Filipino FB account. For them cultists those aren’t true Christians
66,"It's horrifyingly underestimated how powerful the Christian bloc is in South Korea. Every evangelical bordelining fringe extreme Protestant groups that might or might not have had some influence States side flocked there and prospered (even some vanquished pastors from elsewhere also go there for a chance at revival). Christians' influence in SK translate into voting powers. US missionaries often consider SK a luxury vacation. Talent agencies similarly are not hesitant in indulging fans with religious backgrounds (albeit not blatantly) which is one of the reasons why some huge idol groups acquire and retain considerable amount of middle aged and elder fans. Super Junior - one of  K-pop's legendary idol groups from its 2nd generation (basically the 2000s) that is widely considered as ""the people's group"" has one devout Christian member - Siwon, who is also an extreme nationalist and hardcore Reagan fanatic and whose father is also a Christian nationalist. Siwon is very popular and is known to have performed Christian mass songs on popular weekly idol shows.
His Christian background has been selling very well ever since their group's debut in such subliminal ways woven in variety shows, concerts, so on and so forth."
67,"Religious people don't care about facts.  They form their world-view completely on religious fiction and religious fictional events. 

Besides, many christians will think they are not part of the same 'master race' that they are part of, and never, ever accept them as part of their religion.  The exact same way that many churches will never allow gay people to be part of their church."
68,Sort of on topic: are Moonies considered Christian (like Jehova's Witnesses) or have they branched out (like Mormons)?
69,"I imagine they’d be surprised to find out they’re not the good people they’ve convinced themselves they are, as well."
70,"They'd be surprised to learn lots of things.

And, frankly, I'd be surprised if they actually learned a lot of things too..."
71,It's really only 29%? With the churches on every corner and random people walking around yelling at others while carrying a cross I really thought it was more
72,"Sad to learn that 29% of South Koreans don't like k-pop...  

Sadfaceemoji.jpg"
73,"I think the OP is morally alarmed with the enthusiasm for the K-pop movement, which she dismisses as frivolous and materialistic (like anything in pop culture). As always, cultists will seek to control every aspect of your waking life."
74,"It's clearly the Filipino version of ""Rock music is the devil's music"".  It's pointing at a culture it doesn't understand and shitting on it.  The US had a similar ""Satanic Panic"" in the 80s where basically every kind of everything that wasn't prevlent among white christians was Satanic.  This time period is what Dana Carvey's ""Church Lady"" routine was born out of."
75,"In the OP post (it’s in Filipino), she said that “a good Christian should not resort to adultery because in conformity to god’s holy characteristics, god is a jealous god. His jealousy is connected to his holy attributes... and that a Christian should not love material things in this world, etc etc”"
76,">	You can’t drive a Subaru and be a Buddhist.

I bet you anything there are religious nuts out there who genuinely hate Subaru because they had lesbians in a commercial 20+ years ago."
77,You can’t be a Hindu and play Elden Ring.
78,Non-white people are paganism.
79,Poe’s law is at it again
80,"The OP (saw this post on Facebook) feels some sort of moral panic over the K-pop movement, like any other aspects of pop culture."
81,I mean fuck k pop but still fuck religion more
82,"„sOmEoNe WhO bElIeVeS iN gOd!“

Which one?

„tHe ReAl OnE“"
83,[deleted]
84,"According to the FB post where I found it, “God is very jealous and his jealousy is part of what makes him holy... Christians only serve god... materialism is bad etc etc”"
85,Unless it's a predominantly black church. Those voices will have you in a damned chokehold because of how good they are.
86,OOP from FB believes God is very jealous that he doesn’t want his followers to enjoy anything that isn’t about him. God’s jealousy is what makes him holy. And that materialism is bad. OOP is Filipino and K-pop happened to be the most popular genre in the Philippines.
87,"bruh, that's Triple H, not Jesus."
88,"I feel really bad now because I’m literally a 20 year old male K-Pop fan. I don’t obsess over it like a lot of people do, I just really like the music!"
89,It seems to me that most Christians thinks most other Christians are not a True-Christian™.
90,I will never forget how I overheard one of my closest friends in college say she didn't support gay marriage because it went against Christianity. And like... She knew me and another classmate are gay. I think the saddest part is my classmate just accepted not being able to marry in the Philippines.
91,Filipino Christians and Indonesian Muslims are crazy extreme. They see it as like the air we breathe. Not a choice. Yet they're always be seen as outsiders.
92,"Goodbol' Filipino ""Christians""

Least this cultist doesn't look like the Italian flag colored one"
93,I think their version of a true Christian would be someone who has no free will and only does things for god
94,"Korean here, lots of irreligious people hate how crazy Christianity has become in the country. It’s just insane. No words. Should I mention they pull up to Pride Parades en masse and threaten to break gay people’s legs and shit like that?"
95,Depends on what country you’re in.
96,It's unlikely that they're even capable of acknowledging that.
97,"I remember reading years ago that South Korea had the highest density of Christian on Earth, but I checked that before I commented and couldn't find anything like it. I did learn that about 46% of the population have no religious affiliation, 23% are Buddhist and 29% are Christian."

100,But what's the difference between kpop and reg pop to make this distinction. Is it like a race thing..
