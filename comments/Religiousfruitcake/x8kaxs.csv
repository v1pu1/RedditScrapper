3,"Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer"
4,"Oh hell yeah, I'll eat at any restaurant run by Ghost fans"
5,I know that Papa anywhere
6,The downward (inverted) pentagram has many meanings. In Christianity it actually symbolized the holy spirit. This was before Christians became the dumbest creatures on earth and started satanic panic over whatever they didn't like.
7,Hello fellow ghouls!
8,In Ghost we trust
9,"but they do realise that their (normal) money is already full of occult symbolism, no?"
10,"If you have Ghost, you have everything"
11,"These people are so easy to goad, it’s pathetic!"
12,Op has zero clue about the meaning of a pentagram.
13,"What's wrong with Satan? 
Didn't God kill many, many more innocent people?"
14,"My taste in music is more emo + alternative + punk rock + numetal, but damn this place sounds like it goes hard"
15,Ooh a Papa III dollar! That's practically vintage now.
16,Papa! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
17,"*sigh*

No one can trademark the pentagram.

And I love how they used this fake 666 bill with a picture of Papa Emeritus on it. Lol"
18,GHOST
19,"The same people who are afraid of bands like The Misfits or Belphegor. When they think this satanic... then they should take a look at bands like Gorgoroth or Watain xD 
The Devil's Blood is a good choice, too"
20,Omg it’s Papa Emeritus III
21,I feel sorry for anyone who worships anything other than their own family.
22,"Lol, the pentagram is what they picked up?"
23,How come there isn't 666 likes yet?
24,"An ""inverted pentagram"" huh? I think they just mean a pentagram, which is an inverted pentacle. Crazy religious people don't even understand what they are mad about."
25,"Eh, no great loss. They'd probably tip with one of those fake $20s with bible verses on the back."
26,I love kumas. Used to eat there in chi when I lived nearby.  Had been going to the Denver one whenever I was down there. Sad to see they closed that one.
27,why is gerard way on the dollar bill now
28,They make some amazing burgers!
29,"Is it actually metal themed? Because if you had a grab bag of wholesome people and you kept pulling them out, you'd end up with a lot more of them being metal heads than Christians."
30,And Indianapolis!
31,666 w diversy
32,"Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub"
33,I love me some lucifer
34,"The Morning Star, Samael..."
35,Why do people continue the lies even through talking shit about the wrong meaning of things?.Seriously the pentagram was created by christians starting the satanic panic. Come on just give christians all the credit.
36,"Upside down cross is also the symbol of St Peter and the Pope, it wasn't a satanic symbol until horror movies that didn't know any better made them be that.
Edit: For those actually interested there was an obscure case of a gnostic (I believe priest) using the upsidedown cross in what was considered to be an occult manner a long time ago. Typically the symbol is associated with Peter, it wasn't until a couple movies in the 60s, most notably rosemary's baby, that the symbol became widely associated with satanism. Anton levey around the same time was using pentagrams and the leviathan cross in the church of Satan, not an upside down cross."
37,"[They are on Mormon temples](https://www.ldsliving.com/5-types-of-stars-youll-find-on-lds-temples-the-fascinating-meaning-behind-them/s/86110), too."
38,And that’s even intentional
39,No they don’t. It say in god we trust!/s
40,They are probably too invested in a pyramid scene to acknowledge the Illuminati
41,Especially when you fold the 20 dollar bill and you can see the twin towers or if you look at the e where it says one on the 1 dollar bill horizontally you can see batman.
42,"exactly and like Satan just wanted equality and basically freedom, but then he was thrown of off heaven for trying to become the ruler of heaven by gaining the trust of other angels (might be wrong its been Years since I studied this stuff) now thinking isn’t heaven just a dictatorship? like God is the only ruler and if you’re an angel you have to follow his every word otherwise your just throw off."
43,Consistently ranked among Chicago's best.
44,"Yep, they blast metal all the time there. Not sure about the suburb locations or west loop but the original they do at least."
45,"The guy on the bill is identified as Papa Emeritus III, one of the stage names of [Tobias Forge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Forge), so it seems so."
46,Funky town!
47,Nobody mentioned the upside down cross as the cross of st.peter until the internet. If it is the so called cross of st. Peter why don't churches ever have it up anywhere? Tell me what horror movies were the first to use the inverted cross before it was used for satanism or for the disapproval of religion?
48,"Yeah I got my guitar signed by Papa and the nameless ghouls at Kumas, they were doing an appearance there"
49,"Ugh my 13 years of catholic schooling tells otherwise. I was born in 86, growing up the internet wasn’t like it is today and the upside down cross was used as “satanic” imagery going back to at least the 60’s ( if not longer than that) bc people are stupid and don’t know what “satanic” really is. 

Some Catholics used it as saintly iconography years  ago due to paying homage to St. Peter, but it really wasn’t a major thing since the cross is mainly Jesus centered. My devout catholic great grandma had a gold upside down cross necklace that she got when she was confirmed in the church (she went to St.Peters church) but it wasn’t anything that I ever saw in my years nor my moms. I can ask my grandma but she went to a different church named after another saint and well they seemed to focus on thar Saint more so. 

Here is the thing until the exorcist movie came out you were seen as kinda a nut if you thought the devil was a real force, that movie made people go back to the whole mid-evil let’s burn witches mindset. The Church of Satan comes about in the 60’s and it made some waves but people did not really care, they were not taken too seriously. But you get the Exorcist movie, the popularity of games like Dungeons and Dragons and heavy metal and a powder keg of stupidity erupts by people who have nothing better to do.   

Real satanism is far more based off christen teachings then what is tossed around as “satanic” in todays world view. It’s not that popular of a religion. Evangelical Christianity has made it so everything they don’t like (or understand or even secretly dig) is now satanic and evil.  

As for the use in horror movies, it looked cool, that’s it. Very few people know what true satanism is that it’s easy to just use something that looks evil when in reality like the pentagram it was an old Christian symbol they fell out of favor and use."
50,You could've just done a simple google search and not have made yourself look ignorant
51,"The pentagram was an older symbol than christianity though christianity has literally taken symbols from older religions or paganism. Of course satanism isn't going to be as popular but don't forget that the wrong things were taken seriously by christians like the satanic panic or rpg games or whatever being truly ""evil"". Satanism's only connection to christianity if any is the mention of satan or lucifer being created by that religion. The upside down cross was used a while before the exorcist came out so anything using it soon after that pretty much copied them. I also have read about how st. Peter wanting to be crucified upside supposedly because he wanted to or whatever. 

I also read that he was crucified upside down because of the roman emperor nero who had a dislike towards christianity, that it was because of him that he got crucified that way. There's also no mention of st. Peter nowhere in the bible and why would the romans accept st.peter's wishes of what he would wanted? The upside down cross has been used not only by satanism but also people who dislike religion as well. It's been inverted to defy religion which is literally forced upon people everyday around the world.  I myself view satanism as an anti-religion philosophy."
52,You're the idiot saying upside down crosses started in horror movies.
53,"Lmao are you really this fucking stupid? Are you such an empty-headed fuck that you can't even do a simple google search. Can you even fucking read, or did someone have to set up text to speech for your illiterate ass? You were a couple years older than everyone else in your class, weren't you?"
54,"I'm responding to you ain't I, imbecile? Why don't you do the research for me you miserable little bitch. Practice hard being tough behind the keyboard much fucking little twat?"
55,"""fucking twat"" is kinda redundant..."
56,"So you're admitting that's what you are, cool."
57,I wonder how many tries it would take you to roll a tire downhill

59,"No one wonders that about you, nothing to damage up there"
60,Ok says the person who likes to fight online .
61,You seem way more interested in fighting strangers on the internet than I am. I don't go around randomly insulting people out of my own ignorance.  you called me an idiot because you're too lazy and ignorant to educate yourself on a topic before speaking. don't pick fights with people if you're just going to whine about people fighting you online when you can't back up your shit. Fuck off
62,Haha well yea I called you an idiot for claiming false facts. As in the supposed cross of st.peter and the use of the inverted crosses starting in horror movies. People literally use those things in opposition to christianity or religion in general. Either in satanism or atheist points since the upright cross is so fully forced upon people to see all the time everywhere. I thought that's what this sub was against religious fruitcakery and not protecting the views or facts of those that are religious. Which is why Im also confused to why you got so many upvotes on the st.peter thing.
63,"Maybe because I'm right? If you bothered to actually fact check yourself you'd find out I'm right, instead you just go off being confidently ignorant. The upside down cross is a Catholic symbol associated with St Peter, that is indisputable. The inverted cross was first used in an occult manner earlier (in a rather esoteric usage in an obscure story, not one that had any influence on pop culture), but not necessarily satanic and wouldn't be used as such until after certain cinematic depictions in the 60s. The Church of Satan and Anton Lavey also didn't use the inverted cross, they use the Leviathan cross. The use of the upside cross as a satanic symbol is one objectively made up by Hollywood, regardless of whether or not it would later be used by some satanists (which it would be, and I never said it wasn't). 
The only fruitcakery here is your inability to think that you could possibly be wrong, even though I'm quite sure this is a frequent occurrence with you. If you have the ability to actually read at anything beyond a first grade level I'd suggest you actually bother to fucking read anything at all about a topic before you go talking out of your ass again."
64,"https://aleteia.org/2021/08/26/was-saint-peter-really-crucified-upside-down/

https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/the-upside-down-cross-satanic-or-symbolic

You're still going to somehow refuse to acknowledge this extraordinary simple fact, aren't you? Holy fuck, you just really refused to even look up the thing you're arguing about? That's some Christian level dumbassery."
65,"I've seen, looked up the info, and also looked up how it also can't be legit as well. I never heard of or had seen any mention of this from anyone before seeing it online. Not that I'm saying that's where it came from but someone must've of done some searching themselves to disapprove of the inverted cross being unholy or irreligious actually. I've already seen all that bullcrap and so far I've also come across that the whole st.peter crucifixion isn't even mentioned in the bible or has no actual writings about it in christian texts from that time. It didn't even come to be till years later when someone could've easily made it up like much of the actual bible which has been rewritten over and over in time. I also found that the roman emperor nero was the one who killed st.peter and in being against christians. It makes more sense that nero could've crucified him that way in mockery of the regular cross. Why would the romans accept st.peters requests to be crucified how he would want because he's unworthy? Better yet even listen to him. That's also an even more painful way to go by my thought. There's also nero's cross which is basically an inverted cross with broken arms which there is actually writings of and drawn out depictions. If it were up to me that inverted cross shows more disapproval towards christianity since way before it was even that popular.

Edit: grammar and punctuation."
66,"Holy fuck, I've never come across someone as willfully uneducated and ignorant as you. No one ever mentioned the history of the symbol, just the usage, which you could have put together if you didn't have the reading comprehension of a toddler on meth. The symbol (inverted cross)is still one associated with St Peter, and is recognized as such by the entirety of the Catholic Church,  It doesn't matter if you just don't like it or if you wuestion the history behind it, it is still a symbol used by the Catholic Church in association with St Peter. You can make up whatever random shit you want, it doesn't change the fact that the inverted cross has been attributed to St Peter for hundreds of years, you illiterate dumbass."
67,"Ok, you're no different than those religious fucks that think they know it all and think they are right, you're an idiot just like them. How the fuck did I  make that up?? It's actually history. The usage of a fucking symbol begins with the creation of the symbol, how the fuck did you think this argument kept going? Talking about how the symbol came to be is to figure out what its proper usage is. You send me a link to a catholic website instead of something useful like xhub, and you expect me to click it? Whos the real fucking idiot here really? How do you wuestion that?"
68,Best thing you can do to make the world a better place is to go make your face match that girl's that you were getting off to earlier. You absolute piece of shit
69,Praise christ.
