1,I’m of a mind that shit tends to run in packs. I got a fiver says this asshat is cheating on his wife with bob from accounting
2,He’s friends with some shitty people
3,"If god made my ass for shitting, then why does it feel so good when someone [REDACTED]?"
4,"“I have friends who are envious”

He’s talking about himself lol"
5,"Let's pretend they actually know all those people they claim to know and know all their intimate details. How many of those friends has this person lynched for cheating? 

How many have been denied work or housing because they cheat? I'm guessing they don't constantly complain about these people cheating all the time to their face or yelling at them.

This is like comparing apples to semi trucks."
6,This person thinks open/poly relationships are cheating and it’s obvious.
7,Confess your sins? But if Jesus/god is all-knowing then what’s the point of confessing?
