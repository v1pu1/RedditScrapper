1,"Such a delicate god needs a fucking nonce to do his deeds.

Why doesn’t he strike him down himself if he’s so offended?"
2,"Coward motherfucker stabbed him in the NECK

I hope he recovers..."
3,Boy I guess that bounty never went away. Crazy
4,"Hope he fully recovers. 

I  lost the count on how many people who attacked/killed by muslim radicals for blasphemy this year alone.  It just doesn't stop."
5,But Islam is a religion of peaaaaace and tooooolerance my ass.
6,Religion of peace my ass
7,Wow I take it he *really* didn't enjoy The Satanic Verses ...
8,"This post is all wrong. Rushdie couldn't walk off the stage, he's in bad condition. [He might loose an eye and the assailant hit his liver during the attack.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-attack-stabbed-onstage-new-york-latest-updates)"
9,"Walk off? He was stretchered off and airlifted to emergency surgery for multiple stab wounds to head, neck and abdomen."
10,It’s always a man innit?
11,Snowflakes
12,David Blaine? Why?!
13,Looks like an atheist /s
14,Not a man. A worthless pig.
15,"I need some context, who is Salman and what was the event about?"
16,Some Islam skunk
17,"His friend Hitch said it best, religion poisons everything."
18,what did this man write??
19,I hope they throw the book of law at this coward and give him the worst sentence to make an example out of him. Disgusting.
20,I thought he had bodyguards?
21,This is why I’m never telling people I used to be a muslim. Some psycho moozie is gonna try to bomb my house down holy shit
22,And these fucking morons wonder why they're targeted in airport security lines.
23,"So how many Muslims will say Alhamdulillah hearing the news, condone violence and then in the very next statement say how Islam is a religion of peace. Say what you will about fruitcakes from other religions but let's just admit that Muslims are the most violent of the lot."
24,"Because that would prove his existence. A God relies on faith, not proof, to exist, and if a God does give proof that he exists, then they would disappear in a puff of logic."
25,"It's pretty strange that this summary says that Mr. Rushdie was able to walk offstage with assistance. NO, he was put on a stretcher and airlifted to a hospital! This is so scary...the man in custody wasn't even alive in 1989, he's from NJ, and drove up to NY to attack an old man.  F religion.

I got to see him in Harrisburg, PA a few years back, and have enjoyed his writing--but haven't read *Satanic Verses*\-yet. Yes, I hope he can fully recover."
26,Up to 3.5 million now
27,https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/ is your friend. It documents the killings in the name of Islam/Allah/Muhammad.
28,"A piece of you here, a piece of you there...."
29,"Well. Pretty much ANY religion is of peace of tolerance.

People should stop branding their religion as the only truth.

At the end Mohammed or Jesus Christ, is the same shit."
30,Everyone is a critic!
31,"Bc the women stayed in home, duh."
32,Looks like he’s going back home
33,"He’s an Indian author who grew up Muslim and is now an atheist.

One of his books, called The Satanic Verses, includes things about Mohammed that caused ultra right wing Muslims to issue death threats and assassination attempts"
34,He wrote a book that makes Islam looks bad so Muslims try to kill him and anyone associated with the book.
35,Are you Douglas Adams?
36,"“The news is not good,” Andrew Wylie, Rushdie’s agent, said Friday evening. “Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged.”"
37,Very nice website
38,Bullshit website. Lists political/non-religious killings as killings in the name of Islam. Just because I don’t like one religion doesn’t mean I’m in support of misinformation.
39,">And a piece of you way over there staining the wall

\-Kung fu panda 2"
40,At least Jesus didn’t r@pe a child (that we know of)
41,The 1950’s are calling - they want your opinions back
42,"Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a Fatwa in 1989 calling for his death. A Japanese translator of the book was murdered (Hitoshi Igarashi). A few other translators were seriously injured by assassination attempts too.

His bounty for the fatwa was raised by $600k in 2016, on top of the $2.8 million it was set at."
43,"ah, so he wrote the truth.. 

sad world"
44,Yes
45,😥
46,Like what?
47,Poor translator. Just did his job and now gone forever because idiots got triggered.
48,">ah, so he wrote the truth.. 

Basically that one prophet who wrote the al-jilwah, the satanic version of the Quran."
49,For example it was listing the death of a Kurdish woman who fought against ISIS killed by Turkish forces as religious. But it’s 100% political.
