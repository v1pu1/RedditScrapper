1,"They always claim that there are tons of evidence but they never actually provide some. Could it be that there actually isn’t any evidence? No that would mean they are full of shit, surely not."
2,"“ThErE IS a tOn oF EvIdEnCe tHaT GoD ExISts!”

Like for instance…?"
3,"""Prove that proof is proof of proving proof!"""
4,"I once had a Christian try to claim a well reasoned argument is the same as evidence. 

No amount of explanation could get into their brain that a well reasoned argument contains evidence, but isn’t evidence itself."
5,How do these idiots never notice that every argument they make works equally well (poorly) for every deity?
6,Well that is true that logic and evidence will have a few systemic assumptions in the real early stages. That doesn't equal that it's always acceptable to do so the more rungs down the logical and philosophical ladder.
7,"Sure, the sky is blue because ""Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time."" (ripped straight out of NASA's page, first result on google)

But your god didn't give a single reason as to why it's blue. Where's your non-empirical evidence? ""Because God chose it that way"" Do you have proof of that like the thousands of shit you put in his mouth to make up your agenda? Yeah, i didn't think so."
8,"When someone says there is evidence.


Ask them what the evidence is.

Come on lol.


Anytime someone says there is evidence say 

“What’s the evidence? And I don’t want to hear The Bible or look at the earth around me”

Every time. You have nothing to prove to a theist. They have to prove it to you.


**The guy OP posted was talking to me. Look at his reasoning and hypocrisy to everything I talked to him about. He even blocked me when information challenged him**"
9,Evidence isn't evidence but lack of evidence is. That is what we call brainwashing.
10,"""I won't accept evidence"". Also, ""give me evidence"""
11,"From Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy:


God: I refuse to prove that I exist, for proof denies faith and without faith I am nothing. 
Man: The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, it could not have evolved by chance. It proves that 
you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don’t. 
God: Oh dear, I hadn’t thought of that (promptly vanishes in a puff of logic)


Always a favorite."
12,"“But you can’t prove God DOESN’T exist!” To which I reply “you owe me 1 million dollars, prove me wrong”"
13,"The way I see it is that if a person is going to be religious, they HAVE to make peace with the fact that they're making a ""leap of faith"" and realize that they really shouldn't go around trying to shove everything they believe down our throats because the leap of faith is their leap to make, not mine. That is the only way to have reasonable religious people, but 99.9% can't seem to accept this."
14,"Their problem is with the word ""evidence."" No surprise, these are the same people who applaud the phrases ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts."""
15,“Oh you like logic? Prove 1+1=2!”…
16,"The inability to prove empirically that empirical evidence is the only way to prove a phenomenon is a very interesting philosophical snarl.

But that's not evidence for any god."
17,"This is what the person later said was there reason for believing in God. 

>I cannot fit everything necessary to prove that the Abrahamic God is the true God in just one comment without it being excessively long, so I’m going to start small:

>I. All beings are either contingent (exist in another) or necessary (exist in themself)

>II. If there does not exist a being that exists in itself, then beings cannot exist in another

>III. Therefore, a being that exists in itself exists, and this being is what we call God

>Or, alternatively, the same conclusion with a different start:

>I. Everything that begins has a cause

>II. Nothing we observe is the cause of itself, as that would mean that it existed prior to itself, which is a contradiction

>III. If this is the case, there is an infinitely long chain of prior efficient causes. This is not possible

>IIII. Therefore, there exists something that is not caused by anything, and that is what we call God

>Note that this is not an argument that there is a “first” cause, but a principle cause. We cannot necessarily prove that the universe began or that all infinite regresses are impossible, but that an infinite regress of a necessary causal series is impossible and there must be a first efficient cause (that, of course, being God)"
18,"Prove that my dick isn’t in your dad’s ass, empirically"
19,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAJAJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
20,Welcome to Philosophy 101. Today's lesson- Epistemology!
21,I’m no fruitcake but they have a point. Logic and empirical evidence are not the same and both are valid ways of proving something.
22,"Don’t let them play those games. I’d love to hear them prove god without empiricism. They made the case, burden of proof falls on them"
23,This dude broke the Matrix
24,God shoulda watermarked his work
25,"Here is how I test. If your evidence for something existing also proves the existence of something ridiculous, like “tap dancing Elvis zombie aliens” then that is not evidence. That is just special pleading."
26,Smartest apologist
27,There simply is no help for these folks. Their stupidity is self-inflicted.
28,He used the stones to destroy the stones
29,"ngl,"" prove empirically that the only way to prove something is empirical"" it s a philosophy thesis in and out itself, pretty sure some guys dedicate their lifework to that, Plateau or something... 

 But while philosophers are busy with that, leave the gays alone, take your vaccines and stay the fuck out of the goverment."
30,"I agree that this person is dumb, but an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

Lack of evidence is just that. A lack of evidence"
31,"Lack of evidence isn't proof that something doesn't exist though. There are a lot of things out there in the stars that we have no idea exist, but do exist. We have no proof that life exists outside earth, but it certainly does.

But there is zero evidence to a greater power, and there's no way to prove one exists."
32,Christians have moved back into denial
33,"*Ontology enters the chat...*

Well, to be fair, due to our biological perceptions of reality via a fitness payoff paradigm from our evolution can you prove with epistemological certainty that *anything* exists objectively...?

I didn't think so...

*Ontology has logged out...*"
34,"Empirical evidence is, evidently, not the only valid way of proving something, though. I mean, (this post) is religious fruitcake, but there are entire fields of science dedicated to proving things non-empirically. Philosophy and math are the ones that instantly come to mind.     
     
Edit: removed mistakes"
35,Can't be helped. They are too dumb to know why their argument is actually too dumb to be argued and not that they won.
36,"My man, just google the meaning of the word empirical"
37,"I mean.. mathematics has tons of non-empirical proofs that use only logic, not empirical data. I don’t think that empirical data is the only way to prove something. But proof of god….. yeeeeahh right."
38,"""Lack of evidence is evidence""

I know this is religious fruit cake, but come on... that's not how evidence works"
39,Christian apologetics is inherently dishonest
40,"Well im an atheist but hes not wrong, there is a serious problem with being an empiricist, then again there are serious flaws being a rationalist so idfk"
41,extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
42,I can prove that empirical evidence isn't the only way to prop something. Just look in the Bible! /s
43,"Empirical evidence refers to things that can be observed, studied, measured — in real life. 

“Empirical evidence for a proposition is evidence, i.e. what supports or counters this proposition, that is constituted by or accessible to sense experience or experimental procedure. Empirical evidence is of central importance to the sciences and plays a role in various other fields, like epistemology and law.” - Wikipedia"
44,A billion hours of cell phone footage every second for decades without one molecule of a miracle. Not looking great.
45,"Let's assume it's not valid. As this person seems to assert, it means I can just make shit up and declare it valid, then I declare it valid.

The only other option is it's valid. Therefore it's valid, concluding the thought experiment. 

Getting rid of basic logic is unique in allowing this argument to not be fallaciously circular..."
46,"To me, the only reasonable thing that you could call ""evidence of a creator"" is virtual reality.

As someone who has used th tech for the past 6-7 years and has seen it develop in the short amount of time it has existed, I find it reasonable to entertain the idea that a team of developers created what we are experiencing right now.

Disclaimer: this is not a personal belief, just an educated guess."
47,"uhm, the scientific method proves itself. the way we employ the method can be flawed, but it itself cannot be.

want evidence? every scientific misconception/error can be disproven via the scientific method. the bible can neither prove itself or anything else, it must turn to external institutions to do so for it. (pseudo science, apologetics, crack pot philosophy)"
48,Literally any scientific experiment that proves a theory is empirical evidence that empirical evidence works to prove facts.
49,my man needs to learn about the *burden of proof*
50,Then give me the evidence first
51,"This person is expressing themselves badly. There isn't actual evidence of God's existance, there are things that could be interperted as indicators. This isn't material for this sub, and there is no evidence that God doesn't exist. Humans don't know everything, anyone can belive whatever they want but activelly saying there is evidence that God doesn't exist is as stupid saying the opposite. We have no idea about anything regarding our existance and people keep talking like we know everything, relogious fruitcakes and athiests alike."
52,"""Prove that proof works"" is simple. If you're able to use empirical evidence to predict things consistently, and they consistently happen, that's proof that proof works. If you are not able to consistently predict god, nor his actions, then empirically he doesn't exist and doesn't matter."
53,"I mean they're not wrong in saying absence of evidence isn't proof of something not existing. But it's definitely not helping the case that he does. 

But the most important thing is that without that evidence, it is still only faith that he exists. Which isn't the same thing as knowing something exists."
54,"There is cause to look for evidence for an atheist in first place. You can't come to a conclusion then try to look for proof of it. 

The guy walked right into it. Empirical evidences are not against made up figment of imagination. Empirical evidence exists against claims made on behalf of existence of said made up characters.

Also burden of proof lies with one who makes claims. Atheists technically don't make claims. They just broken logic behind the claims made by theists."
55,I can see where they're going but that's a bad way of putting it
56,All creatures great and small.
57,"It is indeed wrong. Of course there is scientific evidence that does not involve empirical data, e.g. everything based on logic or maths.

However that's just another way to disprove the existence of God as described in the Bible: It would create a logical paradox, therefore cannot be true."
58,This feels like a Monty python bit
59,"We can laugh at this, but the religious side has a point here.

There is more than empirical proof. 


Doesn't prove (or disprove...) the existence of God, but he has a point.

A pragmaticist approach is required here: phenomena are the result of a higher reality, but that reality is not God, it's the laws of physics..."
60,You can definitely prove things without empirical evidence.
61,"First time getting posted here, this is an accomplishment"
62,"There is lack of evidence that God exist, but also there is lack of evidence that God doesn't exist."
63,[removed]
64,"""want proof that god is real? LoOk ArOuNd YoU"""
65,"The common loop. ""Want proof that god exists? Read the bible!""

It makes as much sense as plugging in an extension cord to itself and expecting a charge..."
66,Dude theres a really trustable source written by hundreds of random people at different points of time with errors in translation in many places its called the bible its a legit non-fiction book
67,"I majored in philosophy and many of our topics in our Philosophy of Religion classes were the ""Existence of God"" arguments and proofs from people like Thomas Aquinas and Renee Descartes. The one from Aquinas was a joke, put in proof form (like a logical if A then B table) which was easily disprovable, and Descartes' existence of god claims were all horseshit.

All of our other philosophy professors encouraged disagreement, debate, and argument. We'd sometimes even get extra credit for making our own argument against something we learned in class. It took me like half an hour at most to show Aquinas' logical was full of fallacy and not proof at all, and the professor basically plugged his ears and hummed and I'm pretty sure made sure I got my grades lowered accordingly.

Any existence of God argument in Philosophy in all of history is basically a circular argument, and OP's post is like the laughable epitome of that, and as a philosophy major made me literally lol"
68,"There is more evidence of evolution, and other things they deny, but hey"
69,"The only ""evidence"" I've seen is my grandma's gas tank being filled up somehow on the way home from church, a common problem on her model of car was the gas tank being read incorrectly and fixing itself."
70,There's no evidence that God existed. They only have evidence that Jesus existed (multiple sources show a dude named Jesus around the time they claim exist and his tomb has been carbon dated). But for all we know Jesus could have been a con man.
71,"Eyeballs are complicated.

Bananas are easy to peel and eat and fit right in our hands.

Checkmate, atheist!"
72,NEVERMIND THAT PROVE TO ME THAT REALITY IS REAL OR GOD IS REAL BY DEFAULT.
73,"When I asked for evidence this is how they replied

74,"I've been doing counterapologetics for over a decade and I have yet to encounter anything that qualifies as evidence for the existence of the supernatural in general, let alone evidence for any god in particular. 

And trust me, I didn't start out as a killjoy antitheist skeptic. I WANTED paranormal phenomena to be real. But when I went looking for proof, I was immediately slapped in the face with the impossibility of it all.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that happened to me. It was a good learning experience for baby me. I don't understand how so many people never even bother doing that much. Like, if you really belief that there's a grand plan for the universe and your life, designed by an omniscient, omnipotent entity, wouldn't you at least want to confirm that it's actually true? This isn't something you can afford to be wrong about, after all. 

But no. It's fingers in ears."
75,"I wrote two essays for this dude describing my thought process and why I believe in God. Guess that doesn’t get him any karma, though"
76,"Turing said that, right?"
77,"I'd also argue that their arguments are not well reasoned, including that one."
78,It’s the age old classic of making up a claim and shifting the burden of proof onto someone else
79,Learning about other religions is what made me question my own.  What makes me so sure that they're wrong and I'm right?
80,"""Well *something* had to start the universe!"" And they genuinely don't see how flimsy it is."
81,"I mean, have you seen their intelligence?"
82,"I did and this was the response: 

I cannot fit everything necessary to prove that the Abrahamic God is the true God in just one comment without it being excessively long, so I’m going to start small:

I. All beings are either contingent (exist in another) or necessary (exist in themself)

II. If there does not exist a being that exists in itself, then beings cannot exist in another

83,"I prefer ""you don't have any evidence to prove you aren't a goat fucker"""
84,"Religious person here (Pagan), and I'm in this camp. I fully recognize it could all be fake or wrong or any number of other things. That's half the fun in my opinion. If we're all gonna die we all might as well have our own little truths about what'll happen that comfort us."
85,"You know what they say, if you argue with an idiot...

Hope you find a better way to spend your time OP"
86,"I think you really need a mix of them a lot of the time. But I honestly don’t think either can *actually* prove what happens after death, or the existence of some sort of god. By god, I don’t mean a god that creates stuff, more a god that guides souls or something like that. I think the creation type of god can be disproven."
87,"Yes, but with this person I had to state things in a simpler way."
88,">but an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

At some point, it is. 

For instance, if I told you that there are baby leprechauns in your closet, and you open the door, look everywhere, and find nothing, doesn't that suggest that there are no baby leprechauns in there after all? Like, sure, they COULD theoretically be invisible or hiding, but if you don't hear, see or feel anything that even hints at their presence, you're well within your right to call me a liar. 

It's even more damning when it comes to God. There's this almighty being that supposedly created the entire universe and is directly involved in everything that happens in it, yet the universe looks exactly the way we would expect it to look without divine intervention. This evidence leaves us with only two possible conclusions:

1. There is no god. 
2. There is a god, but they don't really do anything and may as well not be there at all."
89,"[Ladies and gentlemen, Bertrand Russell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)"
90,"""Prove"" is a very loosely defined word, you come to a conclusion through logic or theory but in my case I was using the more universal definition of proof which is empirical evidence."
91,Then prove it.
92,Can you give an example of something that can be proven with evidence? Or do you mean specifically empirical evidence?
93,Synthetic propositions- thinks tho?
94,Won't be your last I promise
95,"On the other hand, there is evidence that God (if He exists) does not follow through on his promises or threats. You can even try this experiment at home. Just take any promise from sacred canon, fulfill your end of the bargain, and watch as nothing happens. No reward, no punishment, and no communication. And then you can just have some fun interpreting whatever that means."
