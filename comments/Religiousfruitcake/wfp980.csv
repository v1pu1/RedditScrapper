1,Blind people don’t believe anything at all apparently.
2,"Oh look, yet another made up straw man from the religious. What a surprise!"
3,"Did they seriously include photons?!

In a list of things you can't see?!

Photons! The literal only thing you actually can see directly with your eye. The way in which all other things are seen because photons interact with them and then our eyes measure them directly? Those?

You could not come up with a more science illiterate example of a thing we cannot see.

They are the very epitome of things we can see! For fucks sake."
4,Why does god beam his words to millionaire televangelists and not me?
5,"If it can’t be MEASURED, it doesn’t exist. Real straw man tactics, here."
6,**YOU** ***CAN*** **SEE PHOTONS! THAT IS LITERALLY THE ENTIRE POINT OF PHOTONS! HOW DENSE ARE THESE PEOPLE?**
7,In my opinion spirituality is just a tingly feeling that people get that can often be misinterpreted in bad ways
8,we can see all of those with special tools. which tool does your god react to
9,"It’s it can be detected and measured, it’s real."
10,"You can’t see photons apparently. Have they ever tried, idk, opening their eyes???"
11,![gif](giphy|CoDp6NnSmItoY)
12,"OK, I’ll bite.

1) “I don’t believe in anything I can’t see” is a strawman. No one actually thinks that. The accurate version is “I believe in thinks that can be observed and/or empirically measured”

2) All the things pointed out in this meme can be observed(directly or indirectly) and measured empirically."
13,Yes. My demand for visual-only evidence is so strong that I believe you cease to exist once you leave my location and don't start to exist again until you come back.
14,">molecules

>photons

>atoms

you *can* see these things"
15,All those things are proven and tangible...morons can't meme for shit.
16,"Electricity: Never seen a cord spark when plugged in or fucking lightning?

Photons: Photons are literally all you can see. Photons are light, your eyes are light detectors.

Atoms/Molecules: Every object is made of atoms and molecules, maybe you can't see individual ones but you can see them.

5/9 are actually invisible they got a 55% which honestly sounds about right."
17,"FRUITCAKES: I have FAITH in a God I can’t see!

ALSO FRUITCAKES: I don’t believe that COVID virus is real! How can you prove it exists if you can’t see it?"
18,With the right equipment we can see all of those things. No equipment lets us see god.
19,Them not understand electricity and other scientific things doesn't make them black magic lol
20,"Time a measurement of change.

We can see atoms and photons.

We can use radio waves. TV signals are the same thing.

We can see molecules.

We can see and use electricity.

We can see thoughts in brain activity.

And we can see the effects of gravity."
21,"i love all these religious ""GOTCHAs"""
22,"But we can see these things.

We can observe atoms, photons, brain waves, etc with different scientific instruments.

Things like God, magic, souls, an afterlife are things that cannot be observed through any scientific means. There is no reason to believe they exist. Its as simple as that.

If people understood what they meant when they say ""see,"" then maybe they'd be able to comprehend how religion is fundementally different from science. Its illogical by nature."
23,I love that photons is on this list when it’s quite literally 100% of what you see.
24,"Well let’s see, what shall we call this? How about false equivalencies!"
25,"But we can observe all of those things, if not directly than we can observe their effects. Photons are by definition visible considering they're how we see in the first place."
26,"Damn I guess the phone I’m typing this comment on isn’t made of atoms if I can’t see them. 

Also technically you can see a single atom, you just can’t distinguish it from all the other atoms around it."
27,Man really said people dont think
28,"I mean I can ""show"" you all of these things. I mean hell if your fucking eyes are open your seeing photons."
29,"There is a quote from a great man that I must share. I always respond to things like this with this quote and I suppose it may help you. 
""I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.”"
30,"When we say can’t see we mean “can’t observe” 

But they can’t nuance amd take it literally."
31,"In line at the post office, out of the blue, this lady behind me tells me that time doesn't exist. I turned around and told her to leave an apple on the counter and she'll see what time is. (I didn't tell her it would also teach her what entropy is... one thing at a time...).


I thought it was a great way to illustrate Charles Peirce pragmatist maxim, suggested for exactly that kind of situation (hold on to your hats and wrap your brains around that one):


> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."
32,"Shit like this is why I won't even use the word ""believe"" when I'm talking to a theist. 

More accurately, shit like this is why I avoid talking about gods with theists."
33,"There's no point in arguing with these people, because they don't understand how any of this shit works.

They don't understand microwaves and magnets.

To them, god is just another thing they don't know how to explain, but they're used to it, because that's their whole stupid life."
34,"It's not even worth arguing, if they're so fucking stupid they think these are valid arguments than nothing you do or say will make any difference. Talking to them will just annoy the shit out of you."
35,"I believe in all kinds of things I can't see, but science and math validate these things. While there is no proof of god and you can't prove it's existence even given a million years to research it."
36,Transition electron microscopy much?
37,Observable effects. We can’t see radio signals but we can hear the music playing on the radio.
38,And here ladies and gentlemen is the problem.
39,"Once again, fundamental misunderstanding of the actual argument. Atheists don't believe because they can't see it, but they don't believe it because there is no evidence to suggest that a divine being exists"
40,"The problem is people taking that statement literally and not understanding the actual meaning behind it. When people say ""see"" in this context, they don't mean literally just seeing with your eyeballs, they mean able to demonstrate and prove something exists, or at least observe it SOME way. ""See"" is just easier and shorter to say."
41,"Sure I can't physically see it with my eyes, but it's still demostratable, and there is plenty of hard proof for all of those things"
42,You can see electricity. It sparks whenever you plug something in slowly.
43,what are thoughts doing there
44,"""I don't believe in anything I can't see"", said no atheist, ever."
45,Jemus
46,"Photons lol, that’s literally what seeing is, they’re literally the only thing are eyes can actually observe"
47,Based nihilists.
48,I guess that's the fun part of having a delusional world view. Anything you can imagine is no less real than the rest of your beliefs.
49,"To the arrogantly ignorant it’s all the same, which is hilarious/terrifying to you and me."
50,Yeah I saw that and burst out laughing.
51,light not real
52,On top of that they also wrote electricity. Have these people not seen Tesla coils for example?
53,Pay Per Pray.
54,"Exactly. The bible, quran and all those books full of violence and ignorance are nothing more than what men claim god said. But no god has bothered to show up and tell me stuff for himself."
55,Dense enough that beams of those photons are actually bent when passing by them.
56,"I think it likely stems from us being social animals. We have a lot of features of our minds and brains evolved to this purpose.

For example, we can build up a mental model of someone in our brain, this is useful for getting to know someone. You don't have to step through every thing you know about someone to consider how they would react to something, their moods, boundaries, mannerisms and tendencies are something you can picture. For example you can imagine how someone would respond to a situation if you know them well, even if they are dead or gone. This generalizes and works with people who don't exist too, if you have read or watched a character a lot, you can picture what they might do in a situation, you have a mental model, a schema, of them. In the same way it lets us make up our own characters or imaginary friends, and ghosts, spirits, demons, gods, religions.

Another of course is that as social animals we have tribal beliefs. A group of sapiens wouldn't do too well if we had to discuss our morals and convictions in detail with each member before every group decision. I think there is plenty of evidence that in a group we bond with we reinforce common beliefs. A tribal group may sometimes kill the wrong person, but from a pure survival standpoint, the ones with a tendency to share beliefs probably survived better than those with very little of that tendency.

Also, we need company and security, we get lonely. I think the reasons for that social need are pretty obvious since we survive better working together. This along with the mental-model thing makes us want to make up a figure, or accept one we're given, one that can fulfill some of that need. Ones like Christianity and Islam are successful because theirs offers many roles a person might feel a need for; A protector, someone who loves us, someone who will get vengeance where we are helpless, someone who can assure our future when we're worried, someone to be there when we're lonely. These are human wants and needs and they exploit them.

Even though the needs evolved for a reason that doesn't mean everything that appeals to them is good. Just like candy is bad for us, but we might want it because for most of human evolution more calories meant more chance of survival and more sweet meant more calories. Just like humans who wanted sex more reproduced and their genes carried on, and that might make someone want to look at porn and masturbate a lot even though that doesn't accomplish the reasons evolution favored it."
57,"Same with predatory people like the Prosperity crowd. They purposely direct people's ""something isn't quite right"" instinct away from the true cause and towards something else that allegedly wishes them great harm or to tear society apart. 

Scapegoating one's own instincts, if you will. It's also a narcissist trick, and.. *shocker!* Narcissists love starting or hijacking vocal/pushy/controlling/abusive organizations, such as the born again crowd, cults like Scientology, the workforce behind OAN, the horrible hostile workplace that you quit a year ago. And unfortunately, governments are no different.

Tl;dr - If someone is constantly telling you that you're a victim, they're lying about who's doing it. It's them."
58,His followers are all His tools. They're all tools.
59,"So there's this [amulet](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Dean%27s_Amulet), it's very rare, very powerful, it burns hot in God's presence."
60,"You kind of need an electron microscope due to it being only a few nm across, but it turns out you actually _can_ see them."
61,"Technicallyyyyyy.... According to our current model, you can't see gravity.... But I get what you mean."
62,"I think it's a real case of the Dunning–Kruger effect. They don't understand or even know about how theories are tested, or what indirect observation is, so they assume people who do are just stupid.

I can't see a radio wave, but I can hear it with a radio. That alone doesn't prove that it's a wave in the air or has anything to do with electromagnetic waves.

But if the theory works in all kinds of ways, and properly predicts outcomes and designs made with it work, you can be pretty sure it's a good model. While religion uses bullshit like God doesn't want to give us evidence because he demands faith, he refuses to be predicted, he works in mysterious ways. So it compares like:

""I measured the voltage on this antenna at these locations. My formulas put the source at this location, and predict here it will be this voltage as as you can see it's correct within 1%""

""I know we said if everyone prayed the kid would get better from cancer, and then he died, but that must have been part of gods unknowable plan."""
63,How much for god tokens?
64,"according to the bible, god has never given 2 shits about fairness or consistency. he showed up and personally spoke to a handful of people, all but guaranteeing their belief in him and their spots in heaven. everyone else? fuck you, just believe because a book and some guys told you to.

fuck that guy, what an asshole."
65,Photons gravitationally lensing around dense stupidity.
66,That's a whole lotta words to say daddy issues.
67,"has it, ironically, not burned once since this supposed curse

Edit: oh fuck that’s a supernatural fan page"
68,"One soul, please!"
69,"Ironically, God was able to turn the amulet off lol"
