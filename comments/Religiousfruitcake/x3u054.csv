1,"Imagine this person irl.

I know someone like this. You can be talking about anything on lunch break and she will somehow manage to make it about Jesus. One time we were talking about some weird clouds outside... Yep coming of Jesus is near. Saw a bird flying around the warehouse... Sign of Jesus."

""I know my generic anger at current pop-culture thing x is so predictable even I think I sound like a robot impersonating a stereotype of your granpa, but this time it's actually serious and I'm genuinely concerned!"""
