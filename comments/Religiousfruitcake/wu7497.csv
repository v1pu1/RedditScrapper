1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Okay ... not meant to defend them BUT I guess if it is inside their temple or monastery then they can put their shitty rules (sort of like how some high end bars have a more formal dress codes and other are more chill). 

Once outside then they should have absolutly no say in however people chose to dress."
2,"When I visited a monastery in Greece, they had rules about wearing skirts, but they provided them for people who didn’t have one. My friend and I had fun picking the most awful ones in the collection."
3,Is that Liechtenstein from Hetalia??
4,"They have the right to put the rules in their own house though. If I visit a church, I take of my hat, not because I believe in some supreme being but just out of respect for the rules to visit a non-public space."
5,"He does look cute in that dress, but it really should be his choice."
6,"Original sign didn't have X over the jeans.  They added that later.  Maybe people were wearing ripped jeans? Anyway, I would imagine the main concern was that people had to be covering their shoulders.  The whole ""women shouldn't wear pants"" thing is a bit much.

They could have a better sign that doesn't feel so judgy, probably, but it's their prerogative."
7,"Im as against the church as an institution as much as the next guy on this sub, but having a basic dress code to enter a private building with cultural significance to the community isnt terribly outrageous. 

Out of curiosity though, was there a similar sign illustrating proper dress for gentlemen?"
8,Then dont visit. It's their house
9,Sounds like an excellent reason not to go there.
10,I wonder which one they dream about.
11,"I do think the monks have a right to say what's worn in their own house. I mean, no one bats an eye at ""No shirts no service"" signs in shops and restaurants. Also, these guys are sworn to celibacy. Be kind ladies. It's dirty pool tempting them in their sanctuary, lol!"
12,What I'm more confused about is what language that is
13,"Ah, Romania..."
14,...Did that church use Hetalia fanart for this poster?  That's Lichtenstein.  Got the side bow and everything.
15,"Meh. If steakhouses are allowed to do it, monasteries can too."
16,Lmao I thought it meant no thigh gaps 😂
17,Ya they make rape way more complicated
18,"Every place on earth should be open to sloppily dressed tourists..even  Monetaries. Good find, brah!"
19,What did her right boob do to get a big red X like that?
20,"Nu mi se pare o regula proasta, in sensul ca atunci cand mergi la manastire trebuie / ar trebui sa te comformezi regulilor de acolo. Vizitatul manastirii nu e ceva vital pentru un om, eu de exemplu cand am vazut un semn de genul asta la o manastire din Piatra Neamt pur si simplu nu am intrat. Alta data, oamenii de la manastire au pus niste… rochii, I guess, la intrare pentru femeile care voiau sa intre si nu erau imbracate corespunzator. Cred ca tine mai mult de a arata respect pentru institutia manastirii decat de religious fruitcakeness."
21,"The cross on the jeans wasn't on the sign originally, I think it's specifically referring to the bare shoulders though.  


Also just as a sidenote: Those don't look to be jeans but jeggings since there's no zip."
22,"To be fair, jeans are considered trashy in a large part of the world."
23,"In Bulgaria, they have a similar rule in the Rila Monastery. They don’t let women with “revealing clothing” in. But there were people with jeans, so they weren’t that strict I guess."
24,"This is totally fair. If you’re a guest in someone’s house, holy or otherwise, you should respect their customs. I’m an atheist but I’m not an exception to anyones rules or customs."
25,Don't visit the monastery then?.....
26,"When I visited a monastery in Greece, they had rules about wearing skirts, but they provided them for people who didn’t have one. My friend and I had fun picking the most awful ones in the collection."
27,"I love how they literally admit, if girls don't cover every inch of skin, the old priests might end up getting aroused... In a still failed attempt to not molest girls and boys. What a correlation that old men that want control of everything you do because it's God's will end up being creeps...

It's almost as if, they don't actually believe in the religion, they just want to command and intimidate kids with the fear of upsetting God so they can get away with being creeps. Who'd have thunk it"
28,"Agreed. This is likely an orthodox Christian monastery, the custom is to wear a skirt and cover your hair. I hate the orthodox church with a passion but if you insist on going into a place of worship then you gotta respect the culture. If you don't agree with it just don't go there.

Imagine how disrespectful it would be if some tourist walked into a mosque wearing shoes. Why should this be different?"
29,"Yh I partially agree. It just has bad vibes that they use perfectly decent jeans (rather than booty shorts or something) as their “bad clothing” example, and that there’s no equivalent poster for men. 

TBF these rules were more “strong recommendations” rather than something actually enforced"
30,My thoughts exactly
31,"Your comment made me remember something. My friend got married in a Catholic church, and I didn't cover my hair and nobody said anything. The Catholics who were invited to the wedding did. I just never considered it a thing, as I guess I'm kind of religiously feral."
32,[deleted]
33,"It’s technically a nunnery, not a monastery"
34,Romanian I think.
35,> The most attractive part of a woman is the thigh gap. There’s nothing more tantalising than the clear absence of a penis
36,Maybe they meant the shoulders? Idk tho I can't read the sign
37,"Yes the ""bad clothing"" seems actually pretty normal imo. 

Idk about these rules being ""strong suggestions"" though, some places do enforce them but I guess it depends were you live and if the priest ir crazy enough. I live in a (VERY) catholic country and went to a wedding , most women were using strapples dresses (some of them did have like a shawl to cover their shoulders but most of us didnt lol) and the priest went on a rant about dressing inappropriately in church , it kind of ruined the ceremony"
38,"I agree. They could at least have equal expectations of men and women instead of just women. But, religion is inherently and wholeheartedly anti-women. Despite the fact that they will argue the sins of the father are not the sins of the son.... The same apparently does not hold true to anyone who is female. The whole myth about Eve and Lilith has made it so that women are branded inherently inappropriate by default. They are the ones blamed for sexual sin. They and their bodies are taboo. Men are perfect. Women must be controlled or they will become maidens of Satan by default. So, I'm not surprised in the slightest the sign is aimed at women only."
39,"A couple hundred years ago you wouldnt see women wearing pants, so makes sense this archaic rule exists here"
40,There's a difference between a monastery and a whole country.
41,"Well, if it's an abby, just switch Monk to Nun and flip pronouns."
42,"It is, indeed."
43,"I thought so too at first, but there’s a cross of both the top and the jeans"
44,No I mean that it wasn’t enforced in this particular monastery. I entered it and saw people wearing jeans etc
