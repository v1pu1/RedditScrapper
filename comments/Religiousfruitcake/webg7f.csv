1,"1. not everyone celebrates it

4. He didn't die trying to accomplish something great. He died simply bc of his skin color


5. No one is being forced to have it.


6. People are starting to realize how shitty this world is becoming."
2,This only shows that they don't understand any of the things they are talking about.
3,"Why do they hate experts anyway? I'd rather listen to someone who has studied and researched a field for years, maybe even decades than some idiot who has no idea what they're talking about."
4,Yikes
5,Wtf is DEI training?
6,"Ah, yes. Because all those thing have to do with secularism?"
7,"Pride month is open to all beliefs (including non-belief).

Appeals to authority are considered a category of fallacy, not a feature of secularism.

While it's true that secularists are more likely to take part in DEI training, it's more a simple correlation than a integral part of secularism.

Technically not a martyr. George Floyd didn't die because of his beliefs. Even then, beliefs don't have to be religious in nature.

I reject the religious notion that life begins at conception. A fetus is not a child, so it's not a 'sacrifice'.  Also, secularism does not require an 'adherent' to support abortion on demand.

Was not aware that becoming cognizant of the world around you made you 'born again'."
8,"not how religion works‚Ä¶religion is the belief in a god or gods.if you don‚Äôt believe in god(s),you‚Äôre not religious.why is this so hard for some  people to understand?"
9,"George Floyd was not a martyr for secularism, he was an innocent who was murdered by an unjust system. What he believed or did not was immaterial."
10,"We pay taxes for our ""religion,"" so FUCK. OFF."
11,"This kind of thing is a time-honored tradition of religious institutions: setting the terms and definitions and boundaries within an argument. 

The same thing happened with the term ‚Äúunborn child‚Äù. 

If there‚Äôs anything to call out in this, it‚Äôs that they do not get to set the definitions."
12,"Dam ""Smash Idols"" that name itself is a üö©üö©üö©"
13,"Social justice actually does have classic cultic attributes which appear largely cribbed from Christianity, just minus the supernaturalism, homophobia, misogyny, and forgiveness.

‚úìinherited ancestral sin     
‚úìabsolution only by conversion    
‚úìroots worldview in subjective feeling which can't be examined/argued with    
‚úìclaims to be exclusive arbiter of morality    
‚úìdissent is an act of violence    
‚úìshunning    
‚úìconfession    
‚úìAttempts to censor sinful media    
‚úìSimultaneous passive aggressive hostility to science & claims that it vindicates them  
‚úìMembers snitch on/police each other

When these parallels are pointed out I usually get hostile defensive reactions just like I do from Christians who never considered how closely early Christianity aligns with the B.I.T.E. model. Nobody in a cult ever thinks that's what it is, nobody reacts well to discovering it. They both imagine that because that's not how it looks to them from the inside (by design) that the outsider's perspective must be misinformed. They are also often pre-biased against outsiders, having been taught the world outside the group is wicked and that calling the group a cult is just the sort of thing they might say. 

That said if society needs a new cult with a more inclusive model of morality, so that we have an answer when asked where our morals come from, I suppose we could do worse. I would like to believe humanity will one day move past the need to seek belonging in groups structured like this but for the time being it seems to be taking off."
14,Why does it matter what does if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù if it was it would be the most moral religion out of them all
15,Its gratifying to see their unwavering support for freedom of religion üôÑ
16,Hardcore twitter brain rot here on top of it all
17,"None of those things have a religous or non-religious prerequisite. One could be a Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Pagan, or a follower of any religion to utilize or participate or otherwise benefit from any of the things listed there."
18,Dude needs to look up meaning of secularism
19,I've seen a lot of terrible people on the internet but this one broke me for some reason
20,Because all those scientists are wrong and their book is right
21,Because experts disagree with them on most everything
22,I‚Äôm assuming they mean Diversity Equity and Inclusion training
23,"Good point, they can call me a religion if I get tax exempt status"
24,"The more ya know!

I had never heard of it. I work in hospitality. We don't have that stuff. We are a mixed bag as is, and lemme tell ya, the pure culture shock coming from Small-town, USA to that stuff was an amazing eye opener."
