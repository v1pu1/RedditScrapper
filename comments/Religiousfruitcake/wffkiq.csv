1,Genesis does what nintendon't!
2,Must be the kind where straw evolves in to sort of a man shaped form...
3,"How can anyone ""...take Genesis as truth..."" when it contradicts itself repeatedly?"
4,"They believe in that invisible touch.

It reaches in and makes a man out of dust.

[Genesis (the band) reference]"
5,The Evolution they are talking about is a rib-woman “evolving” from a dirt-man
6,"I’ve had family members say things like adaptation and short term evolution are real but that we didn’t evolve from monkeys. It’s like believing 1+1=2, but 2+2≠4."
7,My favorite part of Genesis is when it takes an omnipotent being multiple days to make one planet but the entirety of universe is just a quick one day rush job.
8,I teach evolution and my brain hurts reading some of this nonsense!
9,"""You can't do this on ~~Nintendo~~ the Quran"""
10,"They forget that the pentatouqe is 4 sources and a 5th redactor, so genesis isn't even real."
11,"God reaches in, sand grabs right hold of your Rib"
12,"What would make sense is god was a proto life form. Probably originates a lot of current life, prone to mutations and evolutions, it all works out!"
13,To be fair that's kinda how a lot of my projects is done.
14,"99.99% of them have no knowledge whatsoever about how the Bible was assembled from translated and mistranslated scraps, plagiarised material and original fiction, then edited and repeatedly re-edited.    
To maintain any faith in the Bible's contents one must remain ignorant of its history."
15,I respond by punching god in the face. I like my ribs thank you very much
16,The number of things these people are ignorant of could fill a bible
