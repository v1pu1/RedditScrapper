1,"This won't get any upvotes and it will get removed due to reports by Hindus on this sub, that happens to almost every hindu content here even if it doesn't happen hey will try and justify it in the comments"
2,I'd doubt will justify this and I am a Hindu. No one is justifying this.
3,The most right wing hindus also condemn this
4,Just the fact that you replied to my comment proves my point lol
5,"I didn't reported this stuff neither I downvoted it ,we hindus should also suffer shame when our religious community does some vile act"
