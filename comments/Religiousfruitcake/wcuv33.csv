1,Maybe I should move to the USA and be a tv preacher for a year or so. Plenty of gullible people and tax exempt by the state. Unfortunately I have ethics
2,"To me is a 50-50 blame. Half on him for even asking (I'm sure it will all go to him personally), but also half on the idiots who actually give him money. How stupid do you have to be to hand over hundreds or thousands to someone because they ask?"
3,"Grifters gonna grift, idiots gonna pay"
4,"Still not as original as Oral Roberts telling his viewers that a 900 foot tall Jesus appeared to him and commanded him to build a ""City of Faith"" hospital complex in the middle of nowhere. Then when fundraising fell short, Oral said thad God told him if he didn't come come up with the money, God was going to kill him.  That worked and Oral lived to bilk another day."
5,"ugh people like these are horrible, preying on people's money like that."
6,Herman?
7,"So then, why doesn't God just write a check?"
8,"It makes me sad that there are so many Americans who are so desperately vulnerable that they would buy into this horrifc bullshit.

I know that religious people in general are very insecure and vulnerable but Americans take it to the next level."
9,Tax the bastard
10,Then who the heck is it for?
11,"If God is real this mother fucker is going to be deeper in hell than I am. Blatant corruption.

I'm honest that I don't believe and I ask nothing like this from believers. I find it impossible to imagine this guy believes and acts this way. He's as much an unbeliever as I am, he's just a greedy liar as well."
12,"Man why do i have a moral compass.

Its seems so easy to scam people, but i could never do that myself."
13,You definitely wouldnt fit in over there then.
14,"I was conned for a while. I am an avid reader. The church people I was around used me until I started questioning what became to me a storybook. It is expected that the masses follow, not question the learned leaders of the church. How stupid? Doh, real stupid! 

From what I know of the storybook, it is manipulated for their benefit/use. I will stick with what I started life out as, ""none"" for religion."
15,"Spot on. I was a useful idiot to religion. Did it for 10 years. Looking back, WTF was wrong with me? I was at a weak point in my life. That is when they swoop in. It has been at least 12 years since my ah ha moment about the bovine scat of organized/corporate religion. Life has been much better since I ended that part of my life."
16,"Fun fact, that missionary kid that was killed by the Sentinelese when he tried to illegally visit their island to spread the gospel, John Allen Chau, he went to Oral Roberts University. So did Kenneth Copeland (televangelist who said he needed a private jet in part because commercial planes were full of ""demons""). I also know a guy from high school that went there, his whole family refused COVID vaccines or following any protective measures because they believe Jesus will literally prevent the virus from entering their bodies."
