1,"One person claiming 500 people saw something 2,000 years ago does not equal ""a solid case, lots of evidence"".

lmao"
2,"Narrator: ""They could not, in fact, provide a solid case or lots of evidence."""
3,"“You could provide a solid case, lots of evidence” but no one ever does."
4,"I've seen people post paintings of Jesus and others comment about what a wonderful photo it is.

I've never been able to figure out if they are just conflating the terms or literally believe there are photos of Jesus floating around."
5,ironically the only flat earthers i met were religious bigots
6,Explaining that there were 500 people hallucinating the same thing is a weak argument against the resurrection. They probably just lied when they wrote it or the legends that emerged at that point were embellished far beyond fact.
7,"> You could provide a solid case, lots of evidence, give them all the info so they are perfectly informed...

But you don't.

I love it when they pretend they have these things, but refuse to share them because ""you're a closed minded poopy head! There's no point! Do you own research!"".

Or, when pushed and they *do share* it usually amounts to ""the Bible says the Bible is true and lots of people agree!"", sometimes with some garbage like ""they found Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat"" mixed in."
8,"The difference is with enough money i could physically show you the eartg isnt flat, but theres nothing you could do to show legitimate proof of a deities existence, nor could you prove that your made up deity is any less made up than every other made up deity in existance"
9,"I think that religious people are more alike to flat earther  and basically any complotist, they use the lack of proof to confirm their ideas as a proof to confirm their ideas"
10,"“Solid case” “lots of evidence” “all the info”. Yeah, the only trouble is that there aren’t such things that support the existence of gods.  Keep tryin’"
11,Primitive people are more likely to believe in gods then intelligent people
12,"Nope, the only record of these 500 people seeing anything is the bible. We don’t have their accounts, so no eyewitness testimony at all. I could claim I jumped over a house one day, and there were 1000 people to see it. I could write this down, does that make it twice more likely to be true? What if someone found my writings 2000 years later would it be true then? You have no evidence, you’re the flat earther in the analogy…"
13,Except we don’t have 500 accounts. We have one guy saying 500 people (exactly lol) saw something. Why can’t they ever be honest about this point?
14,"""solid case, lots of evidence""

Source: trust me bro"
15,"If 500 people swore that they saw a guy walking on water, some of them being very outspoken atheists, then I would believe that there’s a possibility of someone walking on water"
16,"There’s literally videos of flat-earthers proving themselves right.

That said, the real comparison would be between FEs and Theists. in this framework “you cant prove the earth is flat to a round earther” equates to “you cant prove an omniscient, all-knowing diety isnt real to a believer”

Their logic is pre-flawed"
17,"I saw that thread, I love the argument of “well I don’t care if you believe me anyway” once he’s asked for evidence, then  basically calls atheists stupid.

The conversation was essentially:

“I believe God is real”

“Okay can you prove it?”

“You’re stupid and I don’t care anyway”

What a fucking loser lmao"
18,What evidence?
19,"Neither the Bible (rehashed, poorly translated and edited dozens of times into multiple versions) nor the blind belief that ""god did it"" qualify as evidence."
20,They must think Chris angel is actually the 3rd coming then
21,"Bro, 500 people seeing something doesn't mean 500 people understand the phenomena. Like if there's a loud boom in a shopping mall half of the people are gonna think it's a gun despite never actually seeing anything to prove that. It could be a number of things but people tend to go really hard on the first thing that comes to mind. So if you take a bunch of lowly educated people to a field and tell them to stare into the sky for God to make something happen, eventually something will happen that they can't immediately explain so it must be God because that's what they're prompted to believe.

If only we devised a system to discover truth and remove human biases. Some kind of method to follow to ensure not only that our conclusions are valid, but that another person looking at the same data would conclude the same thing."
22,"""I totally have evidence! It just goes to a different school so you don't know it. And the school is in Canada! My evidence is so hot, though, bro, you wouldn't even believe!"""
23,Miracles are more likely then liers. Okay!
24,But.. It is possible to prove the existence of a round earth. This is a fact that can be proven empirically. Faith is called faith for a reason. It’s a belief in something that none of us are in a position to know for certain.
25,"uhm.. mass hallucinations have scientific backing. we’ve observed them historically and clinically. 

we have never “proven” a miracle. eyewitness accounts of hallucinations/outright lies and parlor tricks aren’t miracles"
26,What they are actually saying is that the religious belief is the same as flat earth beliefs and you can’t talk them out of their views no matter how logical you are.
27,"Pot, meet kettle."
28,The funny thing is ... and xtians hate this...religion itself is actually a product of evolution. Early humans living in groups needed a motivator toward not only altruistic but also forgiving and damning behaviors if they were to survive. Accountability was a big part of it too. The problems started when the accountability groups became so large and sprawled out under industrialization that accountability became a much more difficult prospect these precepts began to cause more harm than good and with more people came more competition which is how religion became so bloody tribal.  A system we developed to enforce altruism and compassion turned on us when our numbers grew too large.
29,"I mean... his argument makes sense until you realize that there's significant measurable and repeatable evidence proving the world is round.  And all the evidence for the existence of God boils down to ""have faith"" and ""all these other dudes say they talked to God, but you probably can't"".  I mean... that's the same, right?"
30,***Im startin with the man in the mirror.............***
31,"""500 people had a mass hallucination""

hmm, 500 people. all of whom were raised to believe in the Christian faith, to respect the pastor's words by default, that have participated in a weekly ritual where they are told to be faithful and just to believe that god is real

500 people primed for their entire lives to believe what they are told...

&#x200B;

hmm....."
32,"I’m just so confused
Is red making a case against atheist? Or are they the atheist?"
33,you should have downvoted him.
34,"As I like to point out when this argument gets used: We're living in the age of call phone cameras and live streaming. We should be seeing and hearing about more miraculous events than ever before and yet here we are. I'm pretty sure 300 YouTube uploads of the same statue bleeding during mass would have gone viral at least once in age of broadband and yet I haven't even *heard* of a miracle on that level since the early 90s which, oddly enough, was just before damned near everybody had a camera in their pockets."
35,Idk have atheists been defending a position that's been slowly eroded over the course of centuries or have they been  working to slowly undo religious dogma through empirical evidence
36,"Is this idiot referring to the creed that claims 500 witnesses but doesn’t give any names?

Edit: I checked, and that is exactly what they meant. This is sad."
37,"Pretty sure flat earthers are given studies and experiments that they can perform for themselves and find out. While theists end all arguments with ""you gotta have faith"" that too a blind one."
38,I had to read this a few times to realize that they actually meant atheists and not christians
39,"As an Athiest,  im proudly unreasonable to religious fruitcakes."
40,r/selfawarewolves
41,"They forget that christians were the primary flat earthers when Galileo suggested that earth revolves around the sun. After all, earth being round and revolving around the sun and the possibility of the universe being infinite went against their narcissistic world views that whatever they decide was right and everything should revolve around them. 

Edit: Sorry, got a bit angry thinking that it took 359 years for them to finally admit they were wrong and even then, they did not actually issue an apology, even if posthumously."
42,"I grew up very religious and I heard all the arguments. And they're all bullshit because they all require the same price. God exists. Period. Now let's work backwards from the to prove it. Which is the exact opposite of how science works, where the goal is to disprove your hypothesis, which is based on an actual educated guess, not just cuz you want it to be true. So you can't argue with these people about anything to do with evidence because they're not paying by the same rules."
43,"Ah yes, religious people conflating their bias towards their fairytales as hard evidence. If someone would point me towards actual empirical studies and evidence that God is real or the earth is flat, I'd consider that. However, religious people and flat earthers will always deny anything that their belief is not true, all the evidence and studies be damned.

Edit: tbh I will get defensive before changing my mind but if the arguments and evidence is solid, I will look into it and maybe change my mind."
44,Insane people lol
45,Btw their proof is a pee bottled for 500 years but they by  a mirayla know its from jesus
46,Tbf Richard Dawkins is about as ornery as your local flat earther.
47,"Funny isn't it. thousands of years ago miracle were happening all the time with hundreds of people watching, then film cameras where invented and suddenly all we get the occasional piece of toast that looks like Jesus."
48,"“If” you could provide a solid case with lots of evidence. But you can’t. That’s, like, the whole fucking point."
49,Irony cause bible says earth is flat .
50,"Yeah unfortunately anyone following organised superstition is basically a flat earther, an atheist is just a logical person with common sense 🤦"
51,"ah yes, “evidence”"
52,"If God is real because the Bible said so, then Edward Cullen is real because Twilight says so."
53,"Yeah, all of the ""evidence"" for Christianity is exclusively the rote say-so of a bunch of anonymous, politically motivated, superstitious misogynists who wrote down in a book that they heard from some other anonymous, illiterate fishermen peasants that some other randos supposedly saw a guy do magic 30 years ago."
54,"There was a large number of people in Jonestown Massacre as well, a large number doesn't mean they are right."
55,"Curious how the incidence of miracles died out in exact correlation to the advent and availability of cameras and the more ubiquitous the cameras, the less numerous the miracles. Shame, I really miss those tales of young girls in the forest coming across the Virgin Mary and being handed secret knowledge, but we haven't seen a single selfie with a ghostly Mary in the woods or anything like that."
56,"The irony of him arguing that many people believe in god and that should be good enough reason to believe it’s true. That’s an [ad populum fallacy,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) which is claiming something is true just because the majority thinks so.

Guess what prime example is always given to demonstrate the fallacious nature of the ad populum fallacy? The fact that the majority of people believed the earth was flat but then it was demonstrated that is not true."
57,"Cool, provide that evidence.  You can't, because it doesn't exist, but sure, make up what would happen in a scenario that can't happen."
58,You can prove the earth is round with two sticks and a piece of paper. https://youtu.be/G8cbIWMv0rI
59,"Wait, you have evidence?! Well let’s see it!"
60,I guess miracles are mostly a part of chance.I could be wrong though
61,"or maybe, perhaps, these unnamed 500 people did not even exist."
62,"Their God teaches that the earth is flat.

So it’s actually kind of funny the dude would say that"
63,"The religious debate is not about reason it is about belief.  Belief is spiritual and non rational.   Ultimately religious belief is an opinion.  The beliefs are non provable. They are real to the  person. They can’t be proved or disproved.

Proof is scientific and factual.  Religious belief is spiritual and non rational. Both are valid. Each side uses their belief structure to challenge the other side.

I have no interest in religious  debate.  It has no meaning to me.  

I agree with the pointless comment.  If there is no heaven, when life ends, that is it.

Since life is pointless, each person determines the point of their life.  What gives it meaning."
64,"I can't say I ever understood the idea behind ""proving"" a God or god exists. One of the central tenets of Christianity at least, is faith. You act certain ways because you believe in a higher power.

>Protestant Christians in the Reformed tradition believe that people are saved by grace alone through faith alone. “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast,” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NKJV).   
>

 Confirming that higher power exists removes that whole element."
65,Yall cant proov the earth round tho
66,Not even if he feels it in his heart? /s
67,"> ""a solid case, lots of evidence""

It kills me how low they set the bar for their own 'proof'. And then expect everyone else to respect their 'evidence'."
68,Without any contemporary accounts of same.
69,But there's a book that says so along with a talking snake and a man eaten by a whale that survived
70,"Even If 500 people did apparently see something, it would've definitely been a case of mass hysteria."
71,do they really think they polled 500 ppl who had been dead for a century? (at the time of the gospels writing)
72,"Hell most people don't have a good grasp of shit from 50 years ago that's accurately recorded all over the internet.

Imagine telling people you know about something from 500 years ago because word of mouth. 

Gather around everyone so I can tell you about 1522, having little to no record of the events."
73,"I find it very suspicious that the Gospels were not published for 200+ years after the final event. No witnesses available to verify the events, possibly no one alive that ever talked to an eyewitness."
74,"How about multiple stories about a few children seeing Mary from less than a century ago. I'm sure the fact they were very young qnd raised on religion, hard work and not much else had nothing to do with their halucina- religious experiences.

My favorite part is how Fatima is considered a real miracle by the Catholic church but the one from Medjugorje is not. I mean, they could be a bit more clear about it - a group of children claiming to have seen something is or isn't enough to belive it?"
75,"Hey, that burning bush was extremely eloquent!"
76,"And to be fair,there have been multiple recorded cases of mass hallucination/Hysteria throughout history"
77,Well actually 500 people describing the same thing is a damn good evidence. The problem is we never have that in any religion.
78,"Not forgetting the classic Muslim tale of the splitting of the moon, an event witnessed by thousands but requiring so much energy as to destroy the earth as part of that process. Physics baby!"
79,"It's a flawless analogy, he just got it backwards."
80,"I saw the thread, he told people to go google evidence , the sign of defeat on reddit."
81,We have lots of theories but no evidence.
82,"I even asked him about why he just show it to me then.

“That’s not how it works” or something like that was his answer."
83,"""The bible IS evidence!"" - turds"
84,I love that it’s almost always a white dude too. A guy from the middle east thousands of years ago looked like a surfer from California? Sure. Very real and true.
85,"Flat Eartherism is rooted in religious fundamentalism. 

The Bible says the Earth is flat. Therefore the Earth is flat, and all evidence to the contrary comes from Satan. 

So it's likely basically all Flat Earthers are religionists."
86,"There are a few who aren't. ""Never trust the authorities"" conspiracy theorist types, mostly, who have decided that the earth must be flat simply because the government says it's round.

But yeah, they're vastly outnumbered."
87,That’s because religion actively stifles critical thinking. If you think you know the answer to everything you never have to think again.
88,"Legends often come from vague truths, for all we know jesus couldve been a man who was knocked out in a coma for a couple days and woke up after people thought he was dead"
89,Mass hysteria is a documented scientific phenomenon so it’s not even a stretch that a huge group of people can actually hallucinate the same thing or at least believe they did.
90,"Even if we found ""Noah's Ark"" aka a big ancient ship it wouldn't prove the existence of the Abrahamic god. All it would prove is the flood myths of cultures all over the world that preceed Abraham have roots in actual events that were told as oral traditions until finally be written down long before Abraham lived and gathered those stories for his fantasy novel. One of those stories was of a society that built a huge ship to move their people from one place to another and it got mixed in with the flood stories, and maybe be evidence that humans before the small ice age 10k-12k years ago were more advanced than we previously thought and the evidence of that was ground to dust by 2 mile thick ice sheets and/or buried under sediment hundreds of feet below the seas and oceans.

If any god or gods actually exist it would be quite easy for them to prove it but apparently that's too much of hassle and/or they just love tormenting living beings so much they set up the rules in direct opposition to human nature to watch us flounder before punishing us for all eternity for being big dumdums."
91,Don't even need that much money.
92,"Nothing short of time-travel or literal divine intervention, anyway."
93,"The Romans kept good records. If such an event actually happened, it surely would have been recorded by multiple sources. But instead? Crickets."
94,"Nah, like you've could've constructed something that's basically a metal grid mounted just barely below the water so waves still wash over it like open water, but it would definitely still support your weight. With the right lighting/angle it would be literally impossible to see the structure supporting you.

Like I feel like people have done card magic with more complicated slight-of-hand bullshit than some dude strolling on water."
95,"We’d have to rule out first, subjective experience, mass hysteria is a well documented phenomenon, and we definitely have to consider anything that is documented as aligning with reality, and rule that out before we start yo consider positions with less (or no) evidence to support them


We’d need to get rid of malicious intent too, or intentional trickery. It’s not difficult to mislead people. We literally do it all the time for fun. If you go to a magic show, you’ve got a crowd of 500 people who just saw a lady be sawn in half. It didn’t actually happen, but the goal is to convince us that it did. Now, obviously going In to a magic show, people know it isn’t real, and are trying to figure out how it was performed, but people who don’t know that there’s an illusion at work would think differently, and someone trying to pass it off as a genuine miracle, especially during an extremely superstitious time period, and boom you’ve got a cult following


Then there’s that we don’t actually HAVE multiple witnesses of any of these miracles, we have one person reporting multiple people seeing them. I can tell you that 500 people saw me flying, and unless you can provide those 500 people, verify that they saw what they saw, and that I’m not using any sort of wires or other trickery, you don’t even have to consider what I’m telling you as fact. Yet for some reason they can never provide these 500 people, just one person saying “yeah there were loads of people there trust me”"
96,Which is fucking hilarious
97,"Yeah, it was pretty fucking hilarious"
98,"Mountains i tell you, mountains"
99,The problems started way before industrialization.
100,"Or my favorite “Just look around, this is all the proof you need”"
