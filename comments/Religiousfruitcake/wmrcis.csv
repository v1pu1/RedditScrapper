1,Jesus hates accepting others?
2,"What is the difference between magic/witchcraft and performing miracles?

Like Jesus walked on water, healed the poor, and cursed a fig tree to never bear fruit because it wasn't the season for figs."
3,"You know, for someone who's entire life was based on loving others as you would yourself and ""what you do to the least of these you do to me"", right wing Jesus is a judgmental little bitch about everything."
4,"Surely this is satire?

Edit: definitely a poe"
5,Piss off Jesus don't take your anger out on us just because your dad tried to kill your ass
6,"The yoga isn’t a sin, he watches that one for different reasons."
7,Plot twist. The two people having sex are married… to other people
8,The wikihow aesthetic and the “accepting others” make me think this is satire
9,"Jesus hung out with lepers, bums & whores. I’d say he was pretty accepting of others"
10,"Of all the Jesuses, mean face Jesus is my least favorite."
11,What’s the actual reason to think yoga is a sin? Because it came from Hindu culture?
12,So what the fuck does he actually like? Or is he just a negative douce full of anger and rage all the time.
13,"This sub is the worst at detecting satire, isn't it?"
14,"And I am watching and I judging as well..
This Jesus guy must a revengful control freak ..."
15,Jesus is a hater.
16,Man for a site dedicated to making fun of nutjobs a lot of people here fail to recognize obvious satire.
17,Jesus watchs pre-marital sex? So we are just amateur porn to him??
18,">Accepting others

The 9th of the 10 commandments be like:

***Am I a joke to you?***"
19,"Is, is Jesus Susan Collins?"
20,Bro this is satire... I swear no one recognizes satire nowadays
21,Isn't yoga related to hinduism?
22,But what happens when you don’t care what Jesus thinks?
23,Why does jesus look like the chubby cheeked love child of Tom Cruise and Ryan Reynolds?
24,If they think Jesus hated accepting others then they never read the Bible
25,This had to be created as a joke. Wouldn't be surprised if people honestly believed this and blew it out of proportion
26,"I have a hypothesis about why people spread this kind of messages and condemn others to hell. Either they are jealous that their beliefs don't allow them to have fun and therefore all those people who like fun are condemned to hell, or they themselves are already condemned by their own standards and they feel like they are the only ones going there so they condemn others as well so that they will not be alone in suffering, both here and in the afterlife (if there is any). Essentially saying they are the kind of people to suffer for their beliefs and are angry at the fact that others aren't suffering for what they believe."
27,"I love how they call it accepting others. It's not even called the usual bull about ""impure lifestyles"" or something, just Jesus truly hates the act of tolerance.

Also premarital sex is now so much hotter for me if I picture Jesus watching me from the corner of the room. Does Jesus play with himself whilst he watches us? Or  just sit and smoke? Because I want to perform for Jesus, and maybe just maybe, invite Jesus to join in if it goes that way."
28,"Well, I’m a gay magical yoga instructor and I have yet to see Jesus’s floating, disembodied head give me the stink eye. Also, wasn’t Jesus supposed to be this all-caring, accepting guy? You fucked up your own stories and now the Jesus Head is coming for YOU."
29,Jesus be hate watching
30,Does Jesus not have better things to do?
31,Bro hates accepting others? Doesn’t the Bible literally say love thy neighbor or sum shit?
32,Why does he look like a hipster in a hoodie
33,His *has* to be satire
34,Jesus needs to learn to mind his own business lmao
35,"If Jesus watches me during sex, it’s only reasonable that I give him a show"

37,"Can we stop posting satire

For five minutes???"
38,Jesus loves white hoodies
39,Jesus is a peeping tom
40,this shit looks literally like a typical illustration from r/disneyvacation wtfffffff
41,Jesus is a creep
42,"I feel like the ""accepting others"" turns this into pretty obvious satire."
43,Any religion that is intolerant of accepting people for who they are is indeed the worst religion.
44,This sub is so fucked. I thought this was for showcasing serious religious fruitcakery and not satire? This is so obviously satire it's just sad.
45,Monk here. Whoever created this “meme” is probably (100 - ε % chance) a hypocrite.
46,peeping tom!

54,Judgy Jesus probably doesn't have back pain
55,"Child cancer? Abductions, rape, murder, human trafficking? Nah he doesn’t notice that shid"
56,So 99.99999999999% of Catholic is going to heck
57,This Jesus guy sounds like a prick.
58,"I just like the idea of Jesus walking around heaven with a permanent scowl on his face because he's simultaneously experiencing 8 billion peoples' bullshit.

All that stuff he went through on the cross and people still didn't listen. He was **very explicit** about the yoga. Omniscience is such a stupid superpower"
59,"Damn it,  4 for 4."
60,"Ah, yes . . .

Jesus, the angry and judgemental."
61,"I'd assume the only one would actually be pre-martial sex but I think that was more a product of the time not a religious stand point of ""his"".  I do believe Jesus was at least based on real people and their views just got mashed together."
62,Jesus sounds like a pervert!
63,A nun once told me it was a pagan ritual Buddhists use to increase their spiritual connection with their false gods. If only I knew then that Buddhists don't believe in a god.
64,"This is satire, and has been posted before."
65,Jesus be like >:(
66,"Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to do these things. It could be made by one of them.

They are very homophobic and even the yoga part is true for them."
67,I hope Jesus enjoys the show then lol
68,Please do t watch me having sex. I might disappoint.

75,thats why they are now coming up with christian yoga.
76,Redditors detect satire challenge (impossible)
77,"Premarital sex: wasn’t the seed of Joseph so who is Jesus’s real dad? (jerry springer shit)

Accepting gays: who else invented being gay tablets!!! (Also refer to last “always watching” to understand)

Witchcraft: what is the difference between witch doctors & priests………One has a chickens foot the other molests children

Yoga: not forbidden just disappointed that his wanted males to wear the pants too! 

Make him a deal, stop making existence & we won’t be here! DONE as a party we don’t want to be at"
78,Jesus looks hot AF when he's disappointed in me...
79,"My friend’s aunt genuinely believes that certain yoga positions, like downward dog, physically opens you up for demonic position. I’m just like, ‘whatever ends this dry spell, tia.’"
80,Witchcraft?? This motherfucker raised people from the dead! Isn’t that black magic or some shit?
81,"Ummmm... Harry Potter isn't witchcraft any more than Constantine, with Keanu Reeves, is Christianity."
82,Jesus looks like John Wick.
83,Karen Jesus is going to call the cops on your sins.
84,what a creep
85,Wasnt He the guy who hang out with prostitutes?
86,"I remember growing up in the church, when Harry Potter came out, my grandma and youth pastor told us that we weren't allowed to watch Harry Potter because of the mark on his forehead being ""the mark of the beast"". And of course, all the witchcraft and wizardry.

I even got in trouble with my youth pastor once for playing a couple tracks off the Titanic soundtrack during a Friday afternoon cell group session. The TITANIC SOUNDTRACK. Not even Celine Dion singing, just the instrumental shit. I got reprimanded because it was ""secular music"" and ""shouldn't be played or listened to because it doesn't worship god.""

My youth group and even the entirety of the congregation at my church had weekend field trips to see Passion of the Christ when that came out too, which inevitably devolved into just praise and worship sessions of people speaking in tongues and raising their hands in praise, in the MIDDLE OF THE THEATER, no matter if everyone there was religious or not. They'd happily interrupt the entire show just being stupid, loud and obnoxious, cuz JESUS.

Fuck Church, for real."
87,Jesus is a fucking perverted and potentially a pedophile
88,"Jesus hates accepting others. Remember how he was always casting aside prostitutes, the sick, and the poor in the Bible? 

Why is it that the people who most adamantly profess their love for Jesus always seem to despise Jesus' actual character?"
89,Harry Potter should be fine. That's Wizardcraft
90,But he's perfectly fine with you hating people only cause of their religious beliefs.  Yeah fucking right
91,Are those .. wikihow illustrations?
92,"My very Catholic mom warned me that because yoga has you ""clear your mind"" (apparently of all beliefs as well, in her view), that allows evil to enter."
93,Clearly satire
94,"I like to think he's watching everyone fuck and critiquing performances. ""WHAT ABOUT JULIE'S ORGASM, CECIL? WHAT ABOUT JULIE'S NEEDS?""

*A few decades later*

St Peter: ""Uhh....yeah, sorry, no, you can't get in.""

Cecil: ""What? Why?""

St Peter: ""Ahh...lessee...ah, yeah, here it is. Selfish lover.""

Cecil: ""...What?""

From one of the mansions behind the gate: ""JULIE'S ORGASM, CECIL! WHERE WAS IT?"""
