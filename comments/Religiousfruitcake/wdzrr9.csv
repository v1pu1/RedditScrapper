1,If a pastor at your church preaches the prosperity gospel he's not a real pastor and it's not a real church.
2,But sexual abuse of kids is ok in a real church.
3,"Marriage is NOT exclusively Christian. Hetero couples are not required to be married in a church or by a religious leader. Jews can marry at synagogue, Mormons at temple, and so on. This argument is dumb. There are legal rights attached to being married. You cannot deny people these rights based on a religious interpretation. It's a violation of the first amendment and fucking stupid.

Correction: marriage is NOT exclusively Christian or religious."
4,"If your preacher relies on heavy donations, they aren't a real pastor."
5,"Wonder if they're a wonan? Cause according to the Bible as a man I can tell you to shut up and you must listen. Now isn't that fun.

Edited for clarity"
6,"There's literally thousands of denominations of christianity. God's instructions are so fucking awful that even if he does exists, there doesn't seem to be any clear cut way to determine what the proper interpretation of the bible is (assuming a lot with this reasoning I know).  If a teacher taught a lesson to a room full of students and each student ended up giving a different potentially incorrect answer, then it's probably the teacher's fault and not the students."
7,"But if your pastor fucks kids, he's still a pastor and the church will a) protect and cover up for him, b) slander and ostracize the victim for him, c) pay for the lawyer to defend him, and d) move him to an unsuspecting community and let him DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN!  that's a church for you."
8,None of it is real anyway.
9,"Ah the No True Scotsman fallacy. Two can play at that game, my Christian fundie friends.

No church is a ""real"" church because God doesn't exist. Marriage is a human institution that serves an important function (for better or for worse) in our social and political system, and the only recognition that matters is between the individuals entering the marriage contract and the State.

A pastor is nothing more than a snake oil salesman and has no real authority over anything other than the people who permit him to have authority over them, which is often for reasons related to his business (almost all churches collect funds or tithes in order to support expenses and growth, which is literally just what a business does) and nothing more."
10,This person is right.  That pastor identifies as a woman.  SHE is a real pastor.
11,"I don’t even believe Christian’s exist anymore. I believe there are millions of people that CALL themselves Christian’s. But based on their own book I have never met an actual christian that follows god in any way. Just law 6 of 10 is, don’t lie. Find one that doesn’t. It’s all they do."
12,"If a pastor at your church point his finger at people then he's not a real pastor and it's not a real church. 

Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven. Luke 6:37"
13,If your Pastor is taking donations and not helping the poor with all proceeds it’s not a real church
14,"If a church is getting tax exemptions and telling you to vote a certain way that didn’t exist at the beginning of Christianity , then that’s not a real church"
15,But scarring little boys with the trauma of SA is Godly. Damn!
16,Pearly gatekeeping
17,I think the question is what is a church. Because a church can be interpreted in so many different ways
18,"Sorry Suzie, it just means he's not a pastor at YOUR particular denomination. There are over 10,000 flavors of Christianity. None of which can prove they are the one true denomination and funnily enough, all have followers who claim they ""know in their heart"" that they are following the right path. It's almost as if the Bible is full of convoluted material that people can read whatever they wish into it in order to validate their biases."
19,Praying to the wrong God … Who cares which made up superhero you pray to
20,It looks like a church smells like a church has nice acoustics… the pastor looks like a pastor.. smells like a pastor. Doesn’t rape kids or steal money from poor people and accepts all as if they were his brothers and sisters. Yep definitely not a church and not a pastor.
21,"If you don't follow the beatitudes of christ you aren't a Christian or saved...

I mean anyone can play this dumbas game no?"
22,"Indeed. They are just regular folks, who feel secure enough to not dictate or care about someone else's life choices."
23,Good. Fuck churches.
24,Thats not a pastor! Thats a human being
25,If your pastor doesn't feed the endless thirst of the blood god who cannot be named then he's not a real f'lgningn and you will not be consumed first.
26,No true Scotsman would ever......
27,But wedding between a 12 year old child and a 55 year old geriatric fucktwat is ok?
28,If you don’t believe in equal human rights… you’re not a real human.
29,At this point the no true Scotsman fallacy needs to be renamed “no true Christian.”
30,Nothing quite like Christian Gatekeeping
31,"Getting to the point where religion is nothing but a place to hide your bigotry. These people are worried about dropping church attendance and want to rewrite this country’s laws to force everyone into compliance with their belief system, but the more the church turns into that the more they push people away."
32,That pastor is a hero
33,"If the pastor preaches a bunch of thoroughly debunked fairytales from the bible, tells you to hate certain people because of who they are and pretends to be a religion of peace despite a couple thousand years of war, violence, and genocide in the name of said religion all while raking in tax free money for their own personal profit…then your in a real church."
34,"But raping kids is perfectly fine as long as the pastor blames them for ""leading him to sin."""
35,If the Church at your pastor performs a real Church then Churchill
36,Good
37,I actually agree with this one…
38,"Me standing up in the middle of a service, ""Is this a simulation?!"""
39,"What church is that, is it the Episcopal church?"
40,Pretty sure Jesus was against organized religion.... so.....
41,"So, in order to be a pastor, you need to be hateful?"
42,To be fair anyone who posts shit like this doesn’t think anything is a church unless it’s their bigoted sect of Christianity
43,Then what is he and what is the building?
44,Hea not wrong
45,"If your pastor reads you an English language version of the Bible, that’s not a Bible and he’s not a pastor"
46,"yeah, henry VIII was told he could just start his own church either.... but he did what he wanted."
47,If the pastor at your church actively promotes a political candidate during his sermons... you're in a fucking cult.
48,My pastor (a female!!) performs gay marriages.
49,And then there are the hate preachers.
50,It is a complicated private jet financing scheme.
51,"None of them are ""real"" anything.  They're *all* selling fiction and lies, for a living, cash,  control, and power.  This is not limited to prosperity priests, they're just better con artists than most priests.  That's all.  Not all priests are in it for the cash.  A larger percentage than the normal population are in it to rape children.  So they can have easy access to trusting children while in a position of power, plus the church will lawyer fight to the death with raped children - calling them ""liars"".  

They aren't all con-men and rapists.  Some are truly in desperate need of mental health services.  They actually think they talk to gods daily.  Those gods tell them to do things, sometimes one of the many hate crimes depicted in the bible. 

But prosperity priests being the 'only bad ones'?  Fuck no.  Definitely not.  Seriously, there's plenty of fucked up priests in all  religions, too."
52,They are also not a true Scotsman.
53,"Of course. It's not a real church if there's no sexual assault, evidently.

&#x200B;

(/s, maybe?)"
54,"As my daughter puts it, ""you can get married everyday in a religious service, but it is not legal until it is filed with the state."""
55,Marriage predates Christianity by a few thousand years as well.
56,Did you mean “Marriage is *not* exclusively Christian”?
57,"I hope you meant to say ""marriage is *not* exclusively Christian."" Marriage was around way before any of the Abrahamic religions even existed."
58,"This. It's religious interpretation that is making a mess of things. Our laws should be based on logic, science, medicine, equity...anything but 'religious interpretation'. If we followed christianity for legislation, anyone who works on Sunday is supposed to be stoned to death. They use the bible the way most of us use cook books; use 1 or 2 recipes regularly and never even look at the rest of the book."
59,Depends on the Mormon
60,I've only know one preacher that didn't eventually become someone that wanted to become the next Joel Osteen.
61,Or wears 1 million dollars in jewelry.
62,"Yep. A true Christian is one who is like budda they don't seek material wealth. They give all they can to the poor and needing making themselves poor and needy. 
Only then can they get to heaven.  Because a rich man could.help those in need and choose not to."
63,"Shut up and make babies for Jesus, pretty much"
64,"Ita so fucked because most modern Christians aren't reading the orginal bibles. They're reading a bad  translation of a bad translation x 7 that was hidden in a dead language for a 1000 years.
And even the disciples all started their own cults and many still practiced polthisitic beliefs. And this is true for all major religions."
65,Something it took me way too long to realize.
66,"Okay, this is good!"
67,"I've met plenty. Some of the nicest people I've met are die hard Christians. Who actually practice the new testament faith of love and charity. 
They're not loud about it because areal Christian practices their faith in private not to co Vince others of their faith. 
Which is the true meaning of being sacrilegious and using God's name on vain. If they actually read the Bible. In public they'd be like a woman should be about everything else. Quiet unless spoken to. (A Christian woman. Not women in my opinion. Yall usually have more sane ideas. )"
68,"I concur. I like what a poster said\~""they try to out christian each other."""
69,I was expecting that this would have been the comment finishing with:... Then that's is a real church!
70,Doesn’t anyone ever get tired of saying that?
71,![gif](giphy|cOED9JCtFUZ0BoyoOD)
72,"[John Oliver actually tried to test the limits to see on what could be a church](https://youtu.be/7y1xJAVZxXg?t=880). The answer is that in terms of the US government, there are about 14 characteristics, but you don't actually have to meet all of them. I guess that means that even to the government, it is still quite broad."
73,"Yep.

Almost every instance I've have seen of it being used recently was by christians taking about other christians."
74,So….preachers.
75,"You are correct, in that many believe that they speak *to* God. That’s not the same thing as believing they have spoken *with* god. And many actually do more good in the world than harm. Don’t get me wrong, the ones that do evil deserve to stand trial for said evil even more than the average joes of the world. But when someone is a net positive in the world, you should probably let them continue to do what they are doing."
76,You can cancel the /s
77,Show me a church with no kiddy diddlin and I will consider if it's a real religion
78,"Not in the Netherlands, at least not legally. You can't have your religious ceremony until 2 weeks after your official government marriage. It's to protect people from predatory people who'll trap their prey in a ""cultural marriage"" that they can't get out of, without the legal protections that's afforded to you in a legal divorce."
79,Boooooooooooooooom!
80,It was quite the opposite in my family!
81,"I've tried repeatedly to explain to religidiots that there is no American preacher alive who will perform a marriage ceremony *unless* you have the state mandated license. Christians steadfastly maintain that a couple isn't ""really"" married unless they get married by a preacher/priest in a church. They always believe the *exact opposite* of reality."
82,"I'd argue that if gay marriage was overturned, i mean, gay people will still live together, still include each other in their wills, ect. You can even just wear wedding bands and refer to them as your spouse."
83,"I kept re-reading it and trying to make it make sense... I think you're right, they accidentally a word."
84,"No, marriage is entering a binding legal contract, now if you some mumbo jumbo recited by some self declared god stAnd in that a choice people can make"
85,Good catch. Fixed it.
86,I ask this earnestly. Why do you say that?
87,This. This right here. You have my upvote
88,Christianity is a henotheistic religion.
89,"Nope, never. Every time a religious fundamentalist calls someone a 'groomer' anywhere in the country I'm good for another 100 pedophile priest jokes, so we've got a while to go."
90,"I imagine one day people will get tired of saying it, but only after priests stop raping children.    
Better check back in later.

RemindMe! 1000 years"
91,It's meant to be broad cause religion is broad.
92,Okay I love that and would be pleased to see that law adopted elsewhere
93,Thank you for enlightening me on this. Interesting.
94,"Same. My dad did ""marriage counseling"" (my dad is a pastor, not any kind of mental health professional or counselor. He studied theology, not psychology) for a couple who had their religious ceremony before the legal paperwork was completed. They asked him if it was okay for them to start having sex if they hadn't been legally married yet and his response was, ""which is the higher authority?"" the implication, of course, being that God's authority is higher than the state's and they should start boning."
95,"My daughter has many married gay friends. They have the best weddings celebrations!   

The culture within religious groups lives the reality they are told to. I know the storybook well. When I fell into it for a few years, I read/studied it much to the chagrin of the leaders of the cult. Yeah, they want you ignorant, do not question just follow."
96,"It's a tad more complicated. You have taxes, healthcare, loans, end of life benefits and being able to see them during hospice type scenarios that can only work if legally married. Not allowing them to have that effectivly.makes them.second class citizens in a democracy."
97,"If gay marriage is overturned, that means that the state or federal government no longer recognizes that a couple is married.  That means they don't have the protections of the state that other, heterosexual, married couples will have."
98,"Well it’s a few things.
The main group people usually refer to (church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) consider ourselves Christian’s, so it was weird that you separated it out.

And then “Mormon” can possibly refer to several different offshoot groups as well. With differing doctrines and beliefs.."

100,"Depends on what chapters they follow. Could go either way. 

Now from the start with the Roman's. Yea that's kinda gonna be hedonistic no matter what. 
For the times Roman's were hedonistic and a major reason it caught on like wildfire was the Roman women. Mainly the wives with children. 
They saw how the Jewish families functioned and they liked it and wanted it for their families. 

But you can't be a jewisj and go to any sort of Roman social function. All the food is blessed for another God. 

Christians on the other hand. As long as you don't start worshipping these gods you're fine. 
So Christian populations exploded because they could have a nice close knit family group and still party. 

But. It splits on which ones you follow still. You had a lot of folks who gave away everything and became hobos because they followed christ and then you get the catholic church that drips gold."
