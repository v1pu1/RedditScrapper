1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"“I don’t need to prove it exists”

You do, if you expect to include me in *your* personal relationship with Jesus."
2,"I am 100% fine with them thinking or feeling this way. Just so long as they aren't also trying to force everyone else to follow their religion. Even trying to make their religious beliefs in to law. Or trying to teach it and what it says to kids as fact. Like how they tried to get creationism in to schools. So long as those things aren't being done, this is fine. Problem is, those things are always being done. And are in fact REQUIRED by the religion. Now, those who don't want to accept that part of their book, and don't want to force it on others, fine, things can change, and if enough of you work hard enough to change it, this could stop being a direct part of these religions. And I'd be good with that. But, I some how doubt it would happen so easily."
3,And I don't have to give a fuck.
4,Faith means belief in something without sufficient proof...its not the flex they think it is.
5,"I have faith in science because I can replicate what scientists did to get those ideas. (as long as I have the resources and knowledge)

Can you do that for religion?

Edit: I *trust* science"
6,"This is so fkin snarky and you know they're gonna have to pull something random out of their ass as soon as you apply this dumb logic to anything else. ""I don't need proof when I tell people that you like to catch and eat spiders for fun, I just have \*faith\* that you do""."
7,"No, you don’t. You don’t need any evidence at all, to believe this. You do I’d you want to convince any rational person to be,I’ve it too, or even that you are remotely justified in such a belief. Again you don’t have to do that, it just means we won’t take your beliefs seriously."
8,"I am completely OK if people want to 'have faith' in something.

Go ahead, wear silly hats, hang out with other people and give your money to the nice people who promise you *everything*, but nothing you can ever see. 

But that doesn't fit too well with also wanting special privileges or being tax free. Your faith is no more valid than any other and is worthless"
9,"I'm right here, scribble face."
10,"This is correct in the sense they don’t have to prove God or some other greater power exists, but that doesn’t mean it does exist.  My belief that God exists is strictly a matter of faith.  My faith, for my life.  I have absolutely no problem with people of other faiths, or no faiths, but I do have a problem with people trying to force me to believe in their faiths, or trying to make their faiths the ‘official religion’ of the country.  To prove something requires science, and there are many things which may or may not exist that has not been scientifically established yet, like God, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, extraterrestrials, etc."
11,I think trust would be a more fitting verb in such a case
12,True
