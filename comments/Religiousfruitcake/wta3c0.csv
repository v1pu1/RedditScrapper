1,"Religion has no place in politics. There, I said it."
2,"Funny thing about Mosaic Law. They had the death penalty for anyone who didn't worship the biblical god. And when that was written down, there was no ""holy trinity"" or whatever. Just that one god and only that one god. Think twice before you say that."
3,"6. Kill apostates.
7. Clitorectomies.
8. Final Solution 2.0"
4,"1. No establishment.

Welp, there goes the rest of the list."
5,"Sounds like fatwa envy.

""Why can't we be more like those Middle Eastern countries that make their women cover up from head to toe?"""

7,"I will fight these people to the death if they try to do anything like this. By making these public statements they're declaring themselves the enemy of democracy, the Constitution  and the Rule of Law."
8,Agreed.
9,"Also, isn't Mosaic law intended specifically for Jews to follow? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Gentiles are supposed to be covered by Noachic law."
10,"Good question. Depends on who you ask. Some will say yes. And others will say no. Of course, if the entire Bible is relevant to us today, then I’d sooner think yes. But that’s a different topic."
