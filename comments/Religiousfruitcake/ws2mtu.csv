Remove ALAH and you get im asatan.

The want to remove the letters out of order, just to make it work.

Oh, and Allah has two Ls. So, yeah."
3,"One black guy gets elected and mfs think he's the antichrist. I mean, there is shit to criticize Obama for, but can't we all agree that calling him the literal son of Satan is thinly veiled racism?"

11,"I once had the pleasure of meeting Sasha Obama. Said her interests were partying and not talking about her dad. Seemed cool, just a bit standoffish. 

Not often I get to talk about this, so I'm stretching for the opportunity myself. 

On a more serious note, this is so tame compared to the bigotry and conspiratorial attitude the white nationalist Christian crowd spewed during his terms. I remember a trend where they tried to make people believe he was related to Osama bin Laden and/or Saddam Hussein. Then they said he was ""in bed with the Saudis"" but then when Trump did it all of a sudden the Saudis became the only acceptable brand of Middle Eastern."

16,"They skipped an 'a', so it is: I'm a Satan, thus implying that there are more Satans, but it can't be as Satan is only 1 being, so this is utter bullshit.

Or it could be: I'm as a tan, and that makes a bit more sense."
17,"So if you remove Satan, their name is anagram for I am Allah. Time to start a new cult."
18,"Hey look if I take some names and change the letter order around and take out a couple letters it says a thing!

Jesus Christ that's a reach and a half"

22,"Which one of them is Satan? Or they have to merge with some dragonball shit like the metamor dance? 

Or maybe one of them is Satan and the other is allah, cause if i remove Satan you got ""i am allah"", when you die you found yourself in front of 2 door and the 2 daughter of Obama guarding them, you know that 1 is Satan the other is allah but don't know who is who, you just know that Satan always tell the truth and allah always lie, you have 1 question to understand which door bring you to hell and which bring you to heaven, what is this question and which daughter will you ask it?"
