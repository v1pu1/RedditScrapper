1,"I'd love to know what the ""deep, religious subtext"" of this story is. You know there's a preacher out there somewhere using this verse."
2,"So apparently the son of the all knowing god who is also himself the all knowing god doesn’t know what season a fig tree flowers, and as punishment for his own lack of knowledge he cursed the tree. That totally sounds like the reaction you would expect from someone who allegedly died for our “sins”"
3,What a fuckin Karen.  Does he wanna speak to the fig trees manager too? Smh Jesus
4,God Hates Figs
5,Jesus sounds like a bit of a dick.
6,God hates figs
7,“It’s taken out of context “- every biblical apologist ever
8,That figgers.
9,Old man yells at clouds
10,Such an abuse of power . Running around cursing plants n shit . What a baby .
11,"So, Jesus basically threw a temper tantrum on a tree because... it was not in season for fruit?  


Is this even a real Bible quote? Lmao is all the Bible like this?"
12,Just realized jesus is pro wasp. Wasps polenize figs. And wasps are pure evil.
13,"I remember reading this in church as a teenager! I couldn't stop chuckling! If people ask  ask what my fave Bible story is, I tell them it's the time Jesus got so hangry he straight up pulled the son-of-god card and cursed a damn tree cuz it wasn't in season.

""Yo, dude chill! We can get figs another time.""

""NO! JESUS WANT FIGS *NOW!*"""
14,How can anyone take this book seriously
15,"Exhorosycophant (Out-Seasonal Fig-Shower) 

VS.

Morsycogenezemer (Foolish Fig-Producer Doomer)."
16,The Bible is pretty poorly written. That’s another reason why I think so many zealots only read selected passages and not the whole thing. Most have no idea what’s in it because they’d never get through it.
17,"80% of the Bible is pure ""cool story bro"". Who the fuck even gives a shit about this one time Jesus got hangry. What idiot thought this moment was noteworthy enough to jot down? And it's the same with almost any passage you turn to. It's just nonsense blather."
18,Jesus is a Karen confirmed.
19,TIL jebus was a karen
20,How dare this fig tree not have any figs when it's not fig season.
21,Hangry Jesus needs a Snickers
22,"It's so much worse in context because this story was written to encourage unquestioning obedience as part of the brainwashing process:

>20 And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither away so soon?”

>21 So Jesus answered and said to them, “Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done. 22 And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”



It's an ""ignorance is strength"" message meant to make you shut down the rational immune system's doubt responses that help protect you from bullshit."
23,Jesus hates FIGS! Now it all makes sense.
24,I thought Jesus knew everything. Why did he need to inspect the tree. He should already know it had no fruit.
25,You tell ‘em JC!
26,🤣🤣🤣 Jesus the man baby
27,"I'm sure that tree learned its lesson, repented, and converted many other trees."
28,So he said if can't have any no one can. That's small minded and malicious isn't
29,The original cancel culture.
30,today I learned that Jesus is a petty bitch
31,Fuck you figs
32,Did the guy just talk to a fucking tree?
33,TIL: Jesus gets hangry
34,Old man screams at tree
35,Jesus = the original Karen
36,"Dick move, man."
37,Damn cancel culture even cancels fruit
38,But I just bought fig newtons!
39,This sounds so much like something a spoiled child would do if they could.
40,"“Yo one time the boys and I were coming back from camping and we didn’t have any snacks left. We were all pretty fuckin hungry and Jesus saw this fig tree, so we were like SWEET! Let’s eat some figs dudes. But like, there weren’t any figs on the tree? So Jesus goes ‘fuck you, stupid no-fig-havin-ass tree, I hope you never grow another goddamn fig ya piece of shit,’ and like tries to kick the tree? Funniest fuckin shit, I swear. So now every time we see a fig we flip it off. Idk you kinda had to be there but yeah.” - one of the disciples at a party, probably."
41,Remind me: Isn’t cursing like that a big no-no in the Bible? One that could get you the death penalty?
42,"I mean, he fucking kills people in the gospel of Thomas, I wouldn't know what to expect from this guy."
43,Haha mood though
44,Jesus also tried to find a date on reddit?
45,"or nobody can eat from just that fig tree? 

so what happened next?"
46,Jesus got mad at a fig tree .. imagine that
47,"The fig tree was punished for obeying Yahweh, the god of the bible. Thus the moral here is that we must disobey the bible."
48,"I love bringing that one out. ""Oh yeah, Jesus...he's the guy who yelled at a fig tree because it wasn't producing out of season, right? Sounds like *some*body was a little off in the head, no?"""
49,"I have thought through this 'miracle' and have a grasp of how it could have played out. 

Jesus curses fig tree and the disciples hear the curse. Each disciple then assaults the tree as they walk away. They kick, hit, twist, and bend the tree. They destroy the tree. 

Then when Jesus comes back by the tree, he acknowledges that the tree will never bear fruit. 

No miracle, just a cult following a cue from their leader."
50,What a jackass
51,No figs? Figless??
52,"Na, I was in Israel and I found that fig tree. It has figs 🤷🏻‍♂️"
53,"In the directors edition of the book, the tree went all whomping willow and shot figs up his anus."
54,"""Curse you tree.. from now on you will produce only dingle berries.. I would have made you the tree Judas hangs himself from.. but I had a beef with another tree yesterday"""
55,God hates figs
56,"the bible is mostly metaphor and symbolism, with a smattering of historical accuracy. 

fig tree represented the 12 tribes i=of israel, withering on the vine."
57,"Seems really petty of Jesus to get mad at a tree and curse it. If a tree isn’t bearing fruit when it should be, it’s not getting something that it needs (like pollination)."
58,Jesus is a dick to fig trees...
59,Jesus sounds like a petulant child who’s used to getting his way.
60,"Has anyone made the ""GOD HATES FIGS!"" Joke yet?"
61,So Jessy got a little petty and angry huh. All because he wanted some damn figs and felt entitled to them. Yeah real son of god material over here
62,fun fact: Bethany means House of Figs in Hebrew. (It can also mean House of Poverty…)
63,Hangry Jesus.
64,This was written by some priest that hates figs and thought putting it into the Bible will fit his agenda.
65,Wait... Is this why my mother thinks figs are the fruit of the devil? I never could parse that and this passage didn't stick in my brain after the many readings of the Bible's many versions
66,"This is still one of the most strange of the Jesus parables.

Jesus goes to a fig tree.
It is not the right time of the year for figs.
Jesus curses the tree forever.

Like, dude, thats kinda a karen level freakout right there"
67,This is the absolute best story- my favorite!- from this fictional book 🤣
68,jesus butthurt by growing seasons
69,The fruitcake is actually a sacred raisin cake
70,Imagine if he meant that specific tree only.
71,"Jesus: If I can’t have figs, no one can."
72,"C'mon, not only did his old man supposedly design and implement fig trees, he was (allegedly) _there_ and has git repo access on their source code - and he still doesn't know how they work?

On the other hand, this helps mitigate my imposter syndrome a little, so...er, thank you, Jesus."
73,"Modernist Edition:

Jesus was coming back from Six Flags and wanted a milkshake. The McDonald's milkshake machine was busted so Jesus said ""Bruh, no-one will order from your menu again"" before torching the McDonald's lot to the ground.

Moral of the story: if you can't have what you want you should make sure nobody else can!"
74,"Congratulations OP for not giving the explanation Jesus gave after doing this in verses 21-22. It was to show the power of belief and he did explain that soon after this. Seems like you selectively wanted to show a small part to paint JC in a negative light. Mighty open minded of you.

The verses following: 
20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.

21 Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. 22 If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”"
75,"Not in season? No dates for you ever again!!!!!
Honestly Jesus seems like a Karen at a drive thru."
76,"""...and from that day forth, no further figs were given."""
77,This should go on r/pettyrevenge
78,"I checked the bible at my home and some versions on the internet. Not one had the line:""because it was not the right time for figs"".

source: [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A18-22&version=NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A18-22&version=NASB)"
79,What a baby brain reaction 😂
80,"This translation is a little weird. IIRC, the tree was in the middle of summer, and should have had fruit (you can tell because the predominant variety of fig has full foliage when fruiting), but the tree was the wrong kind or something was wrong with it which is why Jesus was mad. Fig trees were pretty representative of Israel as a nation, and the metaphor I was taught was that Jesus was commenting on the nation of Israel (God’s chosen people) as not producing fruit / lacking in spirituality. So God was symbolically removing his blessing from just the nation of Israel (it would later be transferred to all people after the crucifixtion). So this is a story like him flipping the tables in the temple - commenting on the state of religion in the country.


The crazy folks take it to say he’s talking about women must be fertile, from what I’ve heard.

Ugh, i wish i could replace all this information in my head with something else lol."
81,"I happen to know this one!

It's generally agreed upon by all but the fruitiest of fruitcakes that this story isn't meant to be literal - it is, instead, a metaphor for the Jewish establishment at the time. 

During the Roman occupation, a lot of Jews were deeply disillusioned with mainstream Judaism, especially the Pharisees, and doomsday preachers were cashing in on that disillusionment by the dozen. (Seriously, by all accounts you couldn't swing a dead cat in Judea without hitting a self-proclaimed messiah in the face.)

So this fig tree is basically a stand-in for the Pharisees and the dying temple cult. It's ""out of season"" because the subtext here is that the temple cult once served a purpose, but is no longer necessary and will whither away. Salvation can now be found through Jesus Christ, the Messiah, not through adhering to Jewish tradition as it has existed up until that point. 

In other words, it's all just political squabbling disguised as deep, spiritual Truth. Always has been."
82,"I like to think it means that women who cannot have children are useless. Religion is so misogynistic, I cannot believe this would be far from the truth!

Edit: Looks like I am wrong, but that some people actually understand it that way from what I gather from below comments. That's the problem when you teach something based on a book full of metaphors; everyone can understand it how they want to understand it."
83,"From bible.org…

“The question then is often raised as to why Jesus would curse a tree that was not supposed to be in season. Well, the action was symbolic. The point is that the leaves on the tree advertized that there were figs there as well, but it was a false advertisement. Jesus used this to teach a memorable lesson: the tree was cursed not just because it was not bearing fruit, but because it was making a show of life that promised fruit but delivered none. What Jesus intended by this acted parable was that those who make a show of being religious but in fact are spiritually barren will be cursed.”"
84,Anger and frustration are natural?
85,"I think it's just, Jesus was mad because he was hungry."
86,"I am hungry now!

Fuck you tree!! You're cancelled!!"
87,"Sounds a lot like his followers today. Too stupid to understand basic nature and science, and fuck everyone if they don't get their way."
88,"Also, he cursed a tree with no fruit on it to.....have no fruit?!"
89,"Or like if he's god and can do ""mericles"" why didnt he just make the tree grow figs?"
90,Or in a fit of anger he cursed a tree.
91,Sounds like an insecure child... too insecure to be able to accept his own lack of knowledge.
92,"Could magically feed hundreds with a fish, starves cause no figs on the tree."
93,But seriously fuck that fig tree
94,"So technically Jesus was god in regular mortal human form, which would explain the lack of omnipotence. It does not explain his apparent ability to curse plants. 

Unless the curse didn't actually work, which would actually be the funniest option I think"
95,He knew how to forget too..
96,Branch manager.
97,Bet he left a shitty yelp review too
98,My mum eats dried figs will she go to hell?
99,"Same energy as ""fuck you bitch, you're ugly and I didn't want to sleep with you anyway."""
100,"It's funny, because there is the *Infancy Gospel of Thomas* (declared apocryphal/heretical by Christian authorities way back when), which is what I think of whenever I hear the fig tree story.

Basically the story of kid Jesus being a dick and misusing his powers till he learned to be good. Killing other kids who'd annoyed him, sending adults blind etc Someone you could picture growing up and cursing trees for not having fruit out of season."
