1,That’s an interesting kind of crazy.
2,Pretty sure the gays don't want you either
3,"Contrary to this, I would say that gay sex makes a man more manly because there aren’t women involved and it’s purely testosterone /j"
4,"Just bend over and take it like a man, you know that you want to."
5,"""Being gay should be by choice and not forced onto people.""

Is this person suggesting that straight men are being forced to become gay?

What?"
6,"As a woman, I don't want him either!"
7,Whats manlier than 2 men? 3 men. The more men you can get into this gay orgy then the more masculine and christian this whole thing is
8,I'm not gay but I fuck a bloke that is.
