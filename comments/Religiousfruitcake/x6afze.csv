1,This ain't even the worst. A muslim woman had a fatwa issued against her for this.
2,"Muslim women are worse than their Ameri-Karen counterparts, you'd be lucky to make it to the other side in one piece (personal experience)"
3,Isn't her mother Hindu and dad Muslim?

5,Who are these people? What's the contexts?
6,"Now I want to know, in places where women are covered head-to-toe, are women even given acting credits?"
7,"The post is of a famous Bollywood actress who is Muslim. She is posing with a Hindu god, and Muslims are losing their mind because of it."
8,Its more stupid than that. Her dad is muslim and her mom is Hindu. The outrage is completely insane as she is part Hindu.
9,"Well according to a lot of Muslims, children should take only the religion of their father. Her father is Muslim so they believe she should only be Muslim too"
10,Well they can go jump off a cliff.
