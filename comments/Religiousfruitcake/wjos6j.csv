1,">how ex-muslims threaten Muslim lives

By realizing they're following a death cult and leaving alive."
2,"This guy calls us a threat, the majority of us live in Muslim countries alone and afraid. 
He calls us pro israel, r/exmuslim here on reddit is overwhelmingly pro Palestine.
Everything he says frames exmuslims who are silent, invisible, afraid, literally executed and completely marginalized as insignificant and not worth listening to.

Fuck this guy, from the bottom of my heart."
3,"I have yet to see an ex-muslim threatening violence towards muslims.

I've seen it the other way around plenty of times though..."
4,the same persecution fetish the christianâ€™s have
5,This guy has a mental illness. Ignore him.
6,"I'll say it again, drugs are conducive to eastern religions while mental illness gestures towards Christianity.  Paranoia & delusions of grandeur are dangerous things.  Qanon and fruitcakes fit this pattern.  You have politicians and preachers feeding off the vulnerable mentally ill."
