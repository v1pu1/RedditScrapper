1,I’m going to chastise this person in the fucking face
2,"Imagine defending these points lol. And they call us ""lost"""
3,So now it offends Christians to call rape “rape.” So now all of society has to redefine what rape is so we don’t hurt rapists’ tender feefees.

5,At least they're admitting how shitty their own book is
6,"Wow... just, wow. Batshit crazy."
7,"I'm always relieved when someone admits shit like this, because then I know to avoid them."
8,"The Bible does'nt say anything about a husband's right to beat or rape his wife as a way of asserting himself. It's not difficult to conclude that that sort of power-dynamic is implied and sanctioned based on the general command for women to be subordinate, but it's not explicitly stated.

Corporal punishment is an instrument of authoritarian societies that presume a significant proportion of the population is inherently unreasonable to the point that they must be beat into a state of fear and submission for their own good. This is an extremely cynical and misanthropic view of the world and anyone who proclaims it presumably has fantasies of himself being either overseer on a southern cotton-plantation or bosun on a 19th century sail-ship, authorised to bring down the whip or Cat o' nine on the backs of unruly slaves and press-ganged sailors."
9,"As disgusting and immoral as this is, he is biblically correct....because the bible is disgusting and immoral."
10,"There's some reasons that religious cops use to beat the shit out of innocent people.  They don't feel bad, they're doing 'god's work'."
11,The fact I already knew what website this s... came from before viewing the entire screenshot.
12,"There's nothing called ""forced sex"", there's only sex and rape"
13,"You're aiming too high, albeit at a much larger target."
