1,Why does your god give children cancer?
2,Should we ban all surgeons then? Because they're playing God by saving people's lives?
3,">let God decide

If God didn't want me to get an abortion, he have stopped me. Obviously he's OK with it."
4,I would respond with “which god?”
5,"So, if the pregnant person goes to get an abortion and the abortion works, it was gawds will for the abortion to work."
6,Ask if God decides if someone gets the death penalty
7,"So, if I shoot them and they die, it was meant to me because God decided they should die?

So murder is fine on their world, because only God decides?

Wait then if the abortion works, God did it...

I'm seeing a problem with their logic."
8,You have the right to worship my god as I see fit! Aw freedom of religion
9,Religious people use their beliefs to justify not helping anyone else. That is the most disgusting mentality.
10,Because God has a really poor track record about who lives and dies.
11,"Your god is your problem, please stop trying to make it my problem"
12,Like he decided for all those Jews in the holocaust?
13,So what if one person's god says it's ok and another person's god says it's not? Which god decides?
14,"“So, your God kills people when He has put people on earth who know how to save their life? Your God is a dick.”"
15,"Downvote me or what but
I wish i am his doctor and he gets some serious complicated disease or get bitten by snake so i have the antidote and he begs asking me for the medicine
I will say how about we let the god decide and keep the Medicine in the room just a inch a way from his grasp and keep on chanting let the god decide let the god decide. Call me sadist but They deserve shit from the movie Saw"
16,“Let god decide” literally his whole gimmick is that he doesn’t talk to people or do things for them.
17,My god said I should decide.
18,Surely if the Abrahamic god character had an opinion on abortion he'd have inspired one of the many authors of his fan fiction to mention it.
19,"Someone gets murdered: it's a part of gods plan

Abortion: no"
20,"The rare admission that God lets innocent people die. Nice self-own, there."
21,"My ""God"" Baphomet says that my body is inviolable. So whose ""god"" is more correct here?"
22,"UPDATE:

Red responds with: “Deny God all you want to justify your lifestyle that doesn’t make him not exist.”

Blue responds with: “God doesn’t exist to me and many, many people and that’s our religious freedom. You have the right to believe in whatever you think will make you a better person but that practice only applies to you and you only. Your views shouldn’t stop someone having the freedom to get an abortion.”"
23,"Clearly God wants me to die already, I need my insulin to live, I should just stop taking it. Brilliant plan, thanks God"
24,"If someone is decided to live then they'd just survive. We did it boys, hospitals are no more."
25,"If the Great Spaghetti Monster didn't want your baby to be a well blended ragu, he wouldn't have made it smear red in a blender.

Or was that not the God we are one nation under? It's never specified."
26,"You know, I’ve never been able to tell the difference between leaving something up to God and leaving something up to chance.  How is the god decision point activated anyway? Is it a coin flip?"
27,"So by that logic if a woman has an abortion God has also decided it's time for the end of the zygote/embryo/fetus, yeah?

Or are abortions more powerful than the will of God? 

The notion of free will rubbing up against the notion of a God that decides when things do/don’t happen leads to some of the most confused arguments you ever seen from Christians etc, and usually just boils down to ""you must do what *I* say, God is just an excuse I use for forcing my will on others."""
28,"There was this joke:

3 priests discuss the way they split collection money between them and ""God"".

The first one says he goes half-and-half.

The second one says he throws it on a table: everything that falls off the table is God's. 

The third one says:

> I throw it in the air. God takes what He wants, everything that falls back is mine. 

God has spoken..."
29,"I say we leave it up to Zeus. He is a great God. The best God. If he doesn't want a woman to get an abortion, he can strike her dead with lightning."
30,"This ""God"" fella seems like a bit of a dick. Are you sure you want to worship him?"
31,"No sign from above shows up? He’s not talking, get the abortion. I take nothing short of a thunderclap."
32,If the woman has an abortion it was Gods will right? So leave her TF alone. Morons.
33,"Why isn't our response... ""because god isn't real.""?"
34,God certainly it NOT a trustworthy decision maker- just ask all those Egyptian kids…
35,"""Bro help I'm dying of cancer""
""Now hold on if God gave you cancer shouldn't we wait to see if God will remove it?"""
36,"""I mean why go to the doctor to save someone's life? I mean we should let God decide who dies and who lives! It's the devine plan! Doctors are useless!"""
37,"Dude, it's god's job to test if they're getting into heaven or not.; _when they get there_."
38,So sometimes God decides that innocent people should die. Got that
39,"Maybe we should let God decide if there needs to be a law about it. Just shut the fuck up, let it be legalized, and if God wants a law against it, one will appear on the books without any human involvement."
40,Sure let's ask God. I'm sure he'll give us a speedy response.
41,"Which one, though?"
42,"This guy should just brink some bleach and ""let God decide"" if he is worth saving"
43,I'm totally down to let god decide. That frees us from all of their laws.
44,Don't they believe God gave people free will? why are they acting against god by taking that will away from people and imposing strangers religious delusions on others.
45,"God killed quite a few million people just last year with COVID, so he probably won’t be too upset."
46,"How do you let “god” decide anything?

By drawing lots?"
47,This is what happens when you convince people that anytime who doesn't believe the same thing as then are lying or actively worshipping the devil. They think their morals are objectively correct and everyone else is just trying to be evil.
48,This person better walk the talk and refuse all forms of medical care.
49,I wonder how every Republican would react if another religion forced their views on them
50,Testing their parents' faith
51,I had cancer and almost died at age 10. I was given 2 weeks to live. Someone told my parents that it was because they didn't give enough financial support to the church and it was their fault.
52,It’s *always* because “God works in mysterious ways.”
53,"Also would LOVE to know how/why he repeatedly turns a blind eye to aaaallll those “Representatives” who he has PERSONALLY chosen to serve the people and represent Him, on His behalf - you know, those “Holy men,” i.e., priests who selflessly commit to the 3 vows of poverty, CHASTITY, & obedience (AKA, the ""evangelical counsels"") but then RAPE. LITTLE. BOYS. 
Exactly why tf does god “decide” to allow that???"
54,"Right, this person should also never take any medications ever again, or carry an umbrella or pretty much anything that could be prevented by the power of an imaginary being.

Headache - nope none for you, it's a learning experience.

Allergies - you're being told to stay indoors.

An infected wound - sky bob will decide if it turns into gangrene.

Home on fire - if baby jebus wanted it out he'd summon a rain storm."
55,"I was abused as a child, have a family history of mental health issues that I deal with and have developed major health issues in adulthood. If God exists he can go fuck himself, I'm where I am in life despite him."
56,"If you got sick you should die , why did God give you this sickness if not to end your life ? You are working against the will of God by going to Dr , hell awaits you/s"
57,We should ban all medical treatment. And all safety precautions. Let God decide who lives and who dies!
58,"God blessed them with the knowledge to perform the operation. He also called them to that profession so they could save the lives that they do. Or some bullshit like that. 

The correct answer to the question is ‘well I prayed to god and he said I should get an abortion because I can serve him better without this child.’ They’ll eat that shit up."
59,What’s fucked up is that they’d probably say “Well now he’s stopping more people from having abortions”
60,"Right? Like I'm pretty sure most ""gods"" are okay with abortion (including their own)"
61,"That would be my argument, too. But it’s whatever THEY think god should decide."
62,"I would think so. Also he seems pro abortion, he did flood the world and all that shit. Face it he just loves murder and death so killing a fetus is no big deal"
63,"I think the excuse is supposedly that god wants us to have free will. And supposedly, murder, rape, abortion, homosexuality, it's all the price we pay for free will."
64,"
>I'm seeing a problem with their logic.

The problem is assuming that they are capable of logic."
65,And it completely defies the entire *point* of religion.
66,"They will probably say that was man’s decision not God’s.

I would suggest we close all children hospitals if they believe God decides the fate of the innocent."
67,"Didn't one of those authors write a ""recipe"" for an abortifacient?"
68,Isn’t that most of the Old Testament?
69,Will god care to save a dying child? Find out after the break to know…
70,"Exactly. Like these are the same people who post “anti-Sharia law” posts, generally being Islamaphobic but also want everyone to act in accordance to their Christian cloud man."
71,If God is perfect and all powerful why does it need to test anything? It would already know the result. Isn't that sadistic?
72,That’s sick
73,That’s fucked up. I hope you’re ok now
74,"Why don't they apply this to people who don't believe in their specific god? Oh, I know why, because religions are designed to be a virus."
75,"There's this documentary called ""Dead in the Name of Christ"" that tells exactly that, in a rural American community. According to them, as pharmacopoeia and witchcraft have the same Greek root (surely a word saying knowledge of plants), medicine and especially drugs are diabolical. All they use is prayer and an anointing of oil blessed by the elders.

It's heartbreaking, because their graveyard is full of children, most of whom died of minor causes like dehydration from gastroenteritis.

If you are looking for a good way to experience huge anger, I advise you to see it."
76,Poseidon told me he wants as many abortions as possible.
77,They all act like their god is the only logical one they could be talking about and all other god are silly to believe in without realizing atheists think their “obviously real” god is just as silly to believe in lol
78,Baby fetuses is only a diversion to get dumb people to vote against their own interests.
79,You think that the point of religion is to help people. Lol.
80,Yep. Numbers 5:11-31
81,something something mysterious ways
82,"The answer I usually get is free will. Yes he made the universe, yes he knows absolutely everything in advance, yes he constructed the scenario fully knowing you'd fail, yes he knows *precisely* what you're going to choose eons before you ever existed, and yes, it's a test you never had any chance to pass, but somehow being predestined to do something by a being that planned every atom in the universe to make you arrive at that point *still counts as free will*.

So you deserve to fail because even if the game is 100% rigged not from the beginning, but from *before the beginning*, you still did what god set you up to do and he doesn't like that. Naughty naughty, bad person! You shouldn't have done what god made you to do! Wicked, bad, evil, *naughty* Zoot!"
83,"Yes.  Epicurus said it best 2250 years ago:

“Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”"
84,"I'm in my 50's. Cancer 3 times. 3 heart attacks and major heart damage. I have 27% heart function and scarred lungs. It's going to kill me in the next few years, but I have had a good life. I may be broken, but I am happy. Been married for 29 years, got to see my daughter married, and my granddaughter's birth. (She is now 8). I have a place to live and food to eat. Only thing I don't have is money but I'm alive and that's what matters.

If only my parents would have loved me and given Jesus money."
85,"Yes, religion is for social cohesion, forming moral codes, and providing hope."
86,Haha omg hilarious
87,"A bronze age attempt to stave off existential dread, explain the unknown, and manipulate the tribe. Anything else is an attempt to justify keeping it around."
88,"Yeah, existential dread is totally still a thing. I have no clue how atheists deal with it."
89,"Existential dread is preferable to believing an all powerful god created billions of intelligent creatures, capable of emotion, thought, and suffering, just to let us toil needlessly until we die horribly. At least an atheist can acknowledge the inevitable and adhear to a set of values that they determine and not blindly follow a schizo that thought a bush whispered a perfect code of ethics to him 5000 years ago. 

Check out Albert Camus for an interesting take on existentialism."
