1,"love thy neighbour, Nah I make my own rules."
2,Employers aren‚Äôt allowed to ask about you religious beliefs in the interview process nor are they allowed to discriminate against you because of you beliefs. I‚Äôm an atheist who was the hiring manager multiple times. I don‚Äôt give a damn what you believe as long as you show up to work do your job and aren‚Äôt a piece of shit racist.
3,"""I stole to prove that Christians are superior and more moral than atheists"""
4,How dafuq do you check if your waiter is an atheist?
5,Uh. How are they determining these ‚Äúatheists?‚Äù
6,r/iamatotalpieceofshit
7,"I can't understand americans and their religious obsession...

In my country, if you have a religion or not, it's not well seen to force a religion inside other's throat, or their non religion...

You have faith in something or not, this is your private life and you don't have to interfer with someone else's life...

This is why jeovah's witness and others people like this are forbidden to knock at our doors"
8,"ü§°:jEsUs Is LoVe¬°

üòí:I take it you ran out of fake $20s"
9,This story and the resurrection have a lot in common.
10,"Wasting food, and even worse, meat, and being the most shitty customer for that day will surely show the world how awesome christianity is /s"
11,"Do they mean ""atheist"" or is this code for ""visibly a different religion to me""

How the fuck do you find out your waiter is an atheist? Every restaurant in this guy's area should have this posted to them so they can ban him"
12,Why would the subject of religion even come up with your waiter?
13,Treat thy neighbor like fucking shit. Waste food. Lie. pRaIsE gAwD!
14,"What a ""moral"" person he is. /s"
15,See now why the Puritans were kicked out of Europe?
16,I think you forgot to burn down the restaurant. That will teach them not to hire an atheist for sure.
17,"Maybe the story short on truth, but ""good Christian"" diners can be very discriminatory.  My sister was a server in a high end restaurant. She used to wear a Star of David necklace - small and fairly discreet - but would often be told that she would not get tips as she wasn't Christian.  She said it often seemed to be more out of ""saving money"" than true religious belief"
18,If I were the waiter I‚Äôd bring him a glass of water when he ordered wine‚Ä¶
19,Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not be an a$$hole.
20,Wonder how this idiot can tell who is an Atheist or not?  Give us a quiz that pretty much all of us will pass?
21,"I‚Äôm going with r/thathappened as these types of fantasies rarely play out like this. 

It‚Äôs just fucking weird that all these RWNJs have these cruelty fantasies that they use to virtue signal what terrible people they are."

23,The poor waiter
24,Do you think she knows waiters don‚Äôt make the food?
25,"The Bible actually says that God doesn't enslave people. If Christians stop believing, they're free to live their lives without God and God will give them peace.

Unless they're gay or something like that. In that case the land needs to be purged from them."
26,"Sounds to me like the moral of the story is ""don't serve christians, 'cause they'll just try to rip you off""."
27,Moral superiority established. Lol. üòÇ
28,"r/thathappened

This is a blatent lie."
29,People like this need their faces punched in.
30,"That reads.
When I was in my teens and I didn't know any better, I worked for a couple of hardcore religious conservatives.
The bosses wife looked at me in all seriousness one day and said, ""You know, if the law didn't stop us we'd really only like it if Christians worked here."""
31,"Except none of that happened.  Internet points were had, I guess."
32,"How Christian of them.

How much that guy got a lifetime ban shortly after."
33,I‚Äôve been around 45+ years and can honestly say I‚Äôve never known the religious beliefs or non beliefs of any of the food servers that I‚Äôve encountered.
34,Alex I‚Äôll take Things that never happened for $400. Who the hell talks religion with their waiter?
35,"Why would anyone hide his name lol

We need to see"

37,That‚Äôs a great way to have your ass banned for life
38,How exactly would you even know?
39,Do they ask ever server what their religion is before they order drinks?
40,It's imperative that my server indicates their religious delineation.
41,"i refuse to believe, that this is not fake."
42,Not once in my life have I inquired about the religion of my server
43,"In what scenario do you learn the religious beliefs of your server? I waited tables in college and it never came up once, but I was left prayer cards in lieu of a tip more than a few times."
44,"Who tf is going to restaurants like, ""before I order, I need to know if you're the right religion so I know whether or not to abuse you?"""
45,Wait how would they know if the waiter was an atheist? I have the atheist symbol tattooed on my fucking arm and people still don't know lol.
46,Is this actually real though? How do you just 'tell' that your waiter is an atheist? And who would be stupid enough to actually publicly post this for everybody to see?
47,A religious person being an absolute piece of shit. To absolutely no ones surprise.
48,"Hilarious ,  but smells like satire to me."
49,"Though shalt not steal
Though shalt not bear false witness 
Love thy neighbour as thy self"

51,Any idea if this is a legitimate Christian post? Almost seems to be trolling.
52,Poor waiter‚Ä¶
53,Where do you even go to eat when chicken livers are an option?
54,there is no way that this is not ragebait trolling
55,Why cover the name? She deserves hate. More than the dog who bit me when I was 2.
56,But how'd he know the waiter was an atheist though....?
57,How TF do you even know?
58,Who the fuck do they know who is an atheist or not???? Atheist vision??? Or do they ask like a weirdo?
59,Entitled and mean. The true christian /s
60,How did you know your waiter was an atheist.
61,How do they know that their waiter is atheist? Do they question all their waitresses? Like how did it came up?
62,How would you know your waiter is an atheist unless you badger that person into answering a question that has nothing to do with the job?
63,"‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Bill the atheist and I‚Äôll be your server tonight.‚Äù"
64,Is this an American thing? Religious affiliation is not even a factor in any job or interview here in Australia..unless you‚Äôre going for something in a church or religious affiliated school. It‚Äôs just not a thing. How‚Äôs it impact a secular job? How bloody stupid.
65,How does he know his waiter is an atheist?
66,I bet you this is the same type of person that will complain that the Taliban is intolerant and evil
67,"Poe‚Äôs Law, I‚Äôm so afraid to ask"
68,"How very christian of you...

How do you even know what your waiter believes in? Do you enter the restaurant reciting the lord's prayer and everyone who doesn't join is a baddie?"
69,It thinks the waiter cooks the food lol
70,"First: right, that happened. 

Second: management is gonna care lots more that you‚Äôre a thief than the religious leanings of their servers. 

Third: who the fuck would broadcast their beliefs other than an insane Christian?"
71,"If they're going to follow through on this & do it properly then they also need to give up on:

Their phone, their car, any flights they take, services coming into their home, most of the products in their home... I could go on."
72,How the fuck do you know they are an atheist?
73,"I can't believe that people are actually falling for good obviously fake post. Like people are legitimately mad.  

I thought atheists were supposed to be all about science and shit yet they have zero deductive reasoning.  How exactly does the person know the person serving them in an atheist?"
74,Thou shalt not bear false witness.
75,Somehow I doubt they were wearing a tag that said 'Atheist' on it. Suppose you were wrong?
76,Wtf
77,Ain't no hate quite like Christian love
78,"This choad administers a faith test to all service people unlucky enough to fall into his orbit. 

r/ThatHappened"

81,Don‚Äôt hide the username
82,"Not a christian, but this reads like a republican facebook meme but just inverted and targeted at people to get them riled up about christians‚Ä¶ 

I mean it might be real but honestly anyone could have written this. It makes no sense."
83,"Wow. Just‚Ä¶ wow. I guess she missed like all of Sunday school. Her god literally said, Love your neighbor as yourself and treat others the way you want to be treated. What a fucking awful human being."
84,More like restaurants should stop serving fake Christians.
85,"The saddest part of this post (if it is real) is that this old Karen has no idea what the religion of their server is. She is assuming they are atheist because of how they dress or look. These servers may be Jewish for all we know.

But what is even scarier, is this dumb fucking Karen, basically assumes any non-Christian person is an atheist. So to her, if you aren‚Äôt a Christian, then you must be an atheist, no other religions count. So she is basically representing the antiChrist more than the Christ. Her stance is extremely anti-religion."
86,I REALLY wish people would stop censoring these dumbass' names
87,Yeah but atheists are so full of hate and balah blah blah. Spiteful fucking losers
88,"How would they even know who's an atheist?

It's not like atheists at work, as a server no less, run around wearing atheist t-shirts or necklaces."
89,Religious freedom for me but not for thee
90,But how do they know their server is an atheist? Are they asking or assuming?
91,But if an atheist does even half of this to a theist it's religious discrimination and they should be burned at the stake
92,How would you know if your waiter was an atheist in the first place they're not one of those assholes going around trying to convert people
93,How can you tell if your server doesn't believe in god?
94,Just think of how proud she made Jesus on that day.
95,It's the same group that bombed clinics for 30 years. Don't expect humans.
96,"What a miserable wretched person. 
Also it‚Äôs shit like this that makes a lot of us hate your stupid skydaddy."
97,"When does that Information even get volunteered? 

After the specials?"
98,"Do these people ask for their waiters religion or something? 

""Can I get you guys started with drinks or some appetiz...?"" 

""HAVE YOU ACCEPTED JESUS AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR?? AND YES, JALAPENO POPPERS!"
