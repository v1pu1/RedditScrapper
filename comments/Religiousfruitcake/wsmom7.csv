1,"Ah yes, let the delicate bones heal improperly so each time you break them in the future it gets worse until you can't use your foot. Just like good ol yaweh wants for you."
2,"Why even have a medical brace or support, god's perfect creation shouldn't need any kind of help right? Seriously these people are something else."
3,"One night, God told me to collect all my pee in jars. Now my apartment smells like sulfur."
4,"Have cancer? Just trust in god to heal it for you, and if it doesn’t heal it’s all part of his plan"
5,It must be hard to follow god when you can't walk
6,"Well done, you've virtually assured yourself of a lifetime of endless foot fracturing, constant background pain, and using a stick to get anywhere. God is indeed a great healer."
7,"I guess healing broken brains is a work in progress, eh, God?"
8,"What I think what really happened is that she's uninsured because that's cOmMuNisM.
She can't afford to have surgery out of pocket, so she tries to cope with this situation simply by deciding it's good's will."
9,"She's lucky they didn't have to amputate, cuz god can't stand healing amputees."
10,Nonunion. The fracture fragment has given up trying to fuse. Lifelong ankle instability.
11,Wow. I’m curious if this is a recent post or how much time passed between January 2021 and “Thursday”. If it’s a current post it has been over two years! That’s a great healer?
12,This truly is a fruitcake.
13,"These poor doctors having to deal with this constantly.  I used to be a bit jealous of my friends in college who became doctors. They were smart, dedicated,  and driven in a way I could never be. 

No longer though. I'm not saying they are miserable now, but I certainly would be."
14,What in the methamphetamine fuck did I just read??
15,Maybe God invented that surgery so their foot could get better and now they're refusing it.
16,This is a special kind of stupid.
17,"I wonder how far you can go with bible fuckers. They throw money at televangelists, some people are told to eat grass like animals. Jan 6th... Is there just no line? 'God says everyone here must get into a big orgy pile to cleanse our sins and truly love thy neighbour, we must rebuke the liberal devils, amen!'

I bet you at least half of the people in attendance would just go along with it."
18,It’s the “sent from my iPhone” signature for me
19,"Either that person still has serious residual swelling, or that foot is indicative of raging uncontrolled diabetes that they are also trusting to God. I'm gonna guess both."
20,"Thats nice dear, now 'break a leg' and fuck off."
21,Someone didn’t have health insurance.
22,Why even use the bone stimulator then? Wouldn't God have taken care of it?
23,"God will watch over me. Doctor says you need to fix this. 

They're so fucking literal aren't they? I'm not even remotely spiritual but why not consider the doctor part of God's plan to watch over you?!?!?!"
24,"So: expert advice from a qualified doctor, a brace, and a bone stimulator, and God gets the credit?"
25,"I said no such thing, you fruitcake."
26,"Meanwhile

God: Your would-be surgeon prayed to me every night to pass her exams and get through medical school and her doing this surgery was part of my grand plan. Now you're just gonna go and throw it back in my face!

EDIT: I'm an atheist I just can't resist pointing this out lol"
27,Why do they see doctors if God heals them?
28,Let's let darwinism take it's course.
29,Two years of healing that would’ve probably been ~6 weeks with surgery. I’m sure she was “forced” out of work due to not being able to walk properly and was riding the welfare system the entire time.
30,All this over a dream…
31,That shit is gonna hurt for the rest of her life.
32,God’s doing a great job through all your doctor’s efforts.
33,That poor child. These types need to be charged with child abuse. Too many kids have died from preventable issues bc their parents were fucking this stupid.
34,"As someone who’s broken a fair few bones and nearly needed surgery for a broken ankle… just no. My doctors spent a night um-ing and ah-ing about whether my break was within limits or whether it needed surgery and they went with no in the end. So far every nearly bone I’ve broken and not had surgery on has caused trouble. Ankle still hurts when standing for a while, along with my foot from a collapsed arch after breaking two bones in it, in extreme cases my other leg hurts from breaking a shin bone, my hand is mildly deformed and harder to use from a different break. Broken bones aren’t something you leave to chance, they have the potential to leave you in discomfort and pain for the rest of your life."
35,God gonna make you limp for the rest of your stupid assed life ya dummy
36,Too bad he made you fall in the first place
37,"Maybe next time she falls she'll bump her head and knock some sense into herself.

> One night God said don't do surgery, trust in me, so I did.

So God speaks to her, huh? And he's still happy for her to go to the doctor and get treatment, just not the  treatment that'd be most beneficial? And as a result the healing is protracted, and more likely to lead to ongoing issues?

It really must suck to be a doctor dealing with these nutters."
38,"Literally the sentences next to each other... doctor did X, thank god I'm getting better! 

That sucks"
39,I don't know. I think if God let you fall three times (including twice after a broken bone!) he's not really concentrating on your healing- more like he's trying to break more!
40,"She will never be able to walk well again, if she had listened to her doctor he would have told her that."
41,"Lmfao, guess what, you’re bones heal unless you got loss of blood flow. That bitches bone is healing sure, but absolutely not in the right alignment and could cause painful impingement (ligaments be hurty and that foot be painful)"
42,Doctor gets paid either way. Like he gives a shit your an idiot.
43,"All hail god for healing my broken body, the thing that my body already does- heal."
44,"God: trust me bro

Patient: still go to hospital, still get a medical brace"
45,And I shall call ye gimpy
46,surely the second break was divine punishment for stupidity
47,"I was expecting some kind of miracle story where the foot healed overnight, but instead she just kept breaking her foot and waiting for nature to heal it just enough to break it again- something that probably wouldn't happen for the second or third time if she just got the surgery."
48,"I wonder if she realizes that this that heals on its own, it just doesn't heal right and could cause more pain down the line."
49,😂 this clumsy bitch.
50,Who falls that much??
51,Why did god create this dumbass who can't even stay upright for more than an hour with paper bones?
52,Those religious nuts never consider that surgeon could be sent by god?
53,"God:""It's even funnier the second time!"""
54,Please tell me this psychotic individual doesn't have children or animals in her care
55,Not really trusting in God though if you still took the brace from the Dr and other medical alternatives...
56,She's the new job lol caught in a pissing contest between God and Satan haha
57,I think this persons god is actually their empty pockets.
58,This bitch trippinnnnn
59,´ God said ‘ . This is insanity
60,She should have just asked gOd for better balance...
61,"""My docter, although very annoyed because I was ignoring his advice, gave me the second best, non-invasive treatment for my broken foot. What a bastard. Luckily god healed my foot and not the medication + brace."""
62,it wasn't god it was the doctor's and surgeon's that fixed the bone lmao
63,What a freaking idiot
64,So godly that her foot looks like complete hell
65,Dr did stuff for me then it started to heal naturally. Must be that Jewish god!!
66,Is this woman an acrobat? How does she keep breaking her leg?
67,That does not look like a foot
68,"God damn distal fibula breaks are like, one of the easiest to repair. Would have been in and out of the OR in like 20 min. If it’s anesthesia he’s worried about, he’ll barely even go under. Whatever. No use trying to rationalize with a religious nutjob."
69,Sigh. Pray not to fall so much ya clumsy crossclutcher.
70,There goes my appetite
71,"Nothing says, ""PRAISE JAYZUS"" quite like a permanent limp."
72,I would rather go to a surgery without any painkillers than wait two years for it to heal
73,Just imagine if she got cancer or covid....wait.... isn't that happening all the time to others??? Where's your god then?
74,Dr.s here are obviously the enemy.  I wonder what she would have said if she said I got nothing for you.  Go home and pray...
75,Wow it almost sounds like someone is scared of doing something perfectly reasonable and thus started making up things that God wants them to do instead.
76,"The voices in your head turned a regular break that should have healed in weeks to 2 years of damage and being disabled.

GG WP."
77,They knew da weh
78,"Can't afford to go to the doctor after the church takes their cut of your income. 10% before taxes folks, accountants will be waiting after the service if you need assistance. . ."
79,"Ah yes god did this, with just a little help from the ankle brace and the stimulants"
80,Yea you will have arthritis in that foot now because it won’t heal properly.  Enjoy!
81,"This is a simple lateral malleolus avulsion fracture. I don’t understand why it needs surgery?

Asking out of curiosity. Also why a brace and not a boot?"
82,"If she trusts god so much the doctor should have just sent her right home without doing anything, I get why he can't do that but it would be nice if these people had to face their own stupidity."
83,Heal JAYZUS.  Now pass the collection plate. Oh and some cute boys
84,Why did they go back to the doctor?
85,"Welp, that's all the proof I need."
86,Why is she falling so damn much?
87,God: “I created doctors and medicine to help you fight illnesses...” *facepalms himself*
88,I want to know why God keeps knocking her down and breaking her foot
89,"""Healing"""
90,Dr.GOD?
91,I’ll never get why they don’t believe that their god was smart enough to create doctors and medicine. (Which they wouldn’t really need if god had created them as perfectly as they think)
92,Would this person choose prayer over insulin if they needed it? 🤔
93,She needs to pray for some ankles next.
94,r/Neverbrokeabone will have a fun one with this
95,God gave man a brain and hands able to figure out and cure a broken bone and this moron doesn’t listen.
96,sent from my iphone
97,"Bitch, you ain't Wolverine just let the doctors help you or suffer permanent damage you fucking nut bar."
98,Christian fruitcakes after saying no in the ER after they're told that they need to have their leg amputated after an accident (they believe that the imaginary man in the sky is going to save them)
99,"Yes bones do heal by themselves, issue is they can heal incorrectly leading to more complications and pain and easier to break in the future"
100,"You want me to leave a foot broken? No way!

""Yahweh!"""
