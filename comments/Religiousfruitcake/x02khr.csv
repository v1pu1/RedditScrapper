1,"Ah, the old Piece of the True Cross scam updated for the 21st Century!

Well done!"
2,Why do y'all make fun of it? It must be real - it has a Certificate of Authenticity!
3,I need to start taking advantage of these rubes.
4,I was skeptical until I saw the certificate of authenticity.
5,It's probably just red wine
6,Iâ€™ve been looking for a way to earn some extra money.
7,Honestly this just seems like someone who knows how to appeal to a demographic
8,"Now, if we could only find Joseph's DNA...

There's something I've been wondering about..."
9,They are selling Jesus turds? Am I reading that correctly?
10,"There's a common saying that if all the pieces of the ""true cross"" were combined today, it would be enough to build a ship. Although, at this point, we'd probably have enough for a high-rise condo. I had one when I was younger myself. It came from a gift shop in Utah. Who knew not only were they keeping god's ""golden plates"" there in the safe-keeping of the Mormon Church but they had the cross of Jesus Christ this whole time too!"
11,"Catholic here, this is simony and it's condemned as a sin.

And also, complete horseshit. People selling relics are absolutely scammers."
12,If i was jesus id be insulted as hellâ€¦.and imagine the dickhead u have to be to see ur savior for $20
13,"Dammit why didnâ€™t I think of this.......oh yeah, my pesky conscience keeping me poor."
14,"If we clone Jesus, does the clone got the powers?"
15,I just can't *wait* to see the mental gymnastics they go through to explain this one!! How in the hell would they know it's actually Jesus' DNA?
16,Seems legit.
17,His blood is available at local stores starting from 15$
18,Religious people will fall for anything.
19,Jesus DNA is in France...
20,Sucker born every minute!
21,Wouldn't that mean that it defeats purpouse of Christianity? Jesus came back from death and was taken to Heaven with his body. So that was lie then?
22,Itâ€™s a miracle how a supposed expert can sign the certificate perfectly copying Microsoft word font
23,I wonder how many sales they made?
24,You know that certificate of authenticity is legit since itâ€™s printed on a (US) standard 8.5x11 sheet of printer paper
25,Witches might buy that
26,"Suckers, they should have invested in a piece of Noah's ark like I did."
27,Oooh my father has a piece from France!
28,"See also, all of those saintly relics that, if they're all real, mean a bunch of saints had at least a few dozen fingers.

(Also... ""ancient Roman public privies""?! Uh... Are they purporting to sell you a few molecules of Jesus-dung?)"
29,And they brought it HERE to the flea market where the true believers are.
30,Straight from the Bureau of Totes Legit Authentications.
31,"Started out as water, though."
32,"Gotta find Adam's, and Lilith's..."
33,Holy shit!
34,"Gee, ya think?"
35,Well Catholics invented the saint's finger/saint's shrunken head/Jesus cross fragment pay-per-view scam so of course they have a specific name for the crime.
36,"In the Kingdom of the Blind, the one eyed grifter is king."
37,"Tine to sell this ""viles"" at 50 cents a piece, and put a vaccine in it."
38,"Simony when WE do it. When it's the Church, it's called ""spreading the faith"".

(Ex-catholic on my part...)"
39,"There are *so* many claimed relics floating around, it's not even funny.

>!(Hi, fellow Catholic! There are some seriously antitheistic nutters here, huh? But at least they're not *quite* as bad as the fundamentalistsâ€¦ if nothing else, antitheists usually don't stoop to actual violence.)!<"
40,"Tbf, if they're willing to buy hope of their imaginary friend, you're just liberating those dollars from.a church, so no harm done!"
41,Maybe we've been misinterpreting his Second Comingâ„¢ all along.
42,Whatâ€™s wrong with you? They did CHROMOSOME tests! /s
43,Huh?
44,Oh you.
45,"Well, it's also in the Bible as a sin.

Simon the Magician tried to buy the powers of healing from an apostle, and got very swiftly rebuked.

You can't buy God's love."
46,Hey I'd still say it's simony. Not like the church isn't full of sinners.
47,"Tell me about it! Though I think more are legit that we expect.

I seek to recall Luther saying something like ""if you gathered up all the claimed pieces of the gross around the world, you could build a ship, not a cross.""

Then down the line, someone actually measured the total volume of currently accepted cross relics, and it's like, maybe enough to make a pencil or two.

>!Bonjour, brother! It's fascinating in here, huh? Honestly, I think it's pretty hard to be a Catholic fundamentalist in a lot of ways. Listen to your priest, and you'll be OK :) God bless you.!<"
48,So true. Could put that money toward the FFRF.
49,"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  Riiiiiiight!!

In my mind, I'm trying to figure out how they traced the genetics to Jesus since orthodox Christianity claims he never fathered any children, and since women were just property back then, Mary's lineage would have been impossible to trace. I literally wondered if they had found some genetically testable material (a bone or tooth) that consisted of only *half* of a DNA strand, *OR* if they'd actually found ""THE GOD PARTICLE""!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚"
50,You can't buy something that doesn't exist in the first place.
51,"If I remember my Church history, a few popes were accused of it...

AND one of the basis for the Schism."
52,"I'm compelled to testify it does.

I was an addict for 5 years, both sex and drugs.

Now I'm free through God's grace. He worked upon me and I am healed."
53,"Yuuup. Sin begets sin. There is no guarantees anyone is in hell, but I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if a few popes were down there. Dante thought so."
54,"No, you did it yourself.  It's too bad you can't see it though, that is an achievement that you, and you alone, earned."
55,"It's funny how we live in a world where we aren't meant to deny or invalidate the experiences of others, yet I now find people doing that to me all the time."
56,"Are you sure?  I celebrate your achievement, because it is yours, and yours alone."
57,"I am sure, my friend.

I have achieved nothing, beyond the simple act of accepting God's help when it was offered.

All Glory to God. He does the work."
58,You did all the work. Alone.
59,"I understand the sentiment, but I am assuring you and testifying truthfully to the facts of the matter; I did not.

I am saying as a matter of fact; if it were not for God and His works upon me, I would still be where I was.

Please; I appreciate your sentiments and kindness, but do not tempt me to pride. I do not desire glory nor praise, for those belong to Christ."
60,No reason to testify. You did it alone. Well done. Be courageous and appreciate your accomplishment!
61,The only courage I need is the courage to follow Christ.
62,Alone.
63,"With Christ with me, every step of the way."
64,"Alone, by your self, every day. And I have proof, you."
65,"I was an atheist for 26 years. I'm a scientist. Diplomas, degrees, published research.

I'm afraid I have more proof than you that Jesus did it, sorry. You can only accept or deny my testimony. I have witnessed.

Answered prayers. Genuine visions. Religious experiences. Witnessed miracles. Lives saved.

I saw a 9 stone man take five boxes of paracetamol, Come to Christ, come to me in terror asking for help, and emerge unscathed.

That shouldn't happen. As someone who's had acetaminophen poisoning, their liver should be dead or severely damaged. Like, lifelong disability or death should have been the outcome according to medical science.

Not a scratch. We prayed a lot in that hospital.

The spirit of God walks with us always. I have simply chosen to walk with Him.

This, to me, is undisputable fact. It is reality. You cannot shake me on this.

My life stopped feeling like a sandbox, and I saw the truth that it was a story that God was telling.

You're welcome to DM me if you'd like to know the truth too. They're lying to you. The world is not as you believe.

It's far more remarkable than that."
66,"And nothing you mentioned is proof because as any ""scientist"" would know.... (if you can't fill it in then you are not a scientist).

I find it amazing when coincidence is branded as something special.  You know when I was coming into work today I saw the license plate FFT-3298, isnt that just amazing!!  What are the odds?  That I would see that plate today of all days!! It must be something imaginary.

At least you are commenting in the right sub."
67,"As for proof; give me a *definitive proof for gravity.*

Not theory. Not evidence. Definitive proof.
You'll find there isn't really a way. There is always room for doubt. It diminishes rapidly to a vanishing point, but never to zero.

As Heisenberg said, ""The first sip from the glass of natural science will make you an atheist. At the bottom of the glass, God is waiting for you.""

God bless you. May Christ heal and fulfill you as He has done for me."
68,"You are making the claim, you have to produce the proof, that is how it works.  Since you offer none, I can reject it with the same level of evidence.

No one, nothing is waiting for any of us.  Stop wasting your time.  Quaint and meaningless quote, as is everything in any religious text."
69,"Heisenberg wasn't a religious figure.
He was one of the fathers of quantum physics.

I assume you subscribe to the notion gravity is real and well described. Provide me the proof.

You can absolutely play the line ""I never claimed to subscribe to gravity."" That's fine and logically consistent.

But the logically consistent conclusion of that line of thinking is ""I believe in nothing"", because nothing has proof beyond our own consciousness."
70,"Wrong, you state there is something, **you** have to do the proof.  I hold no responsibility to prove gravity or dogs exist, as I have said neither.  All you are doing is ignoring your own responsibility and trying to make it mine.  Most likely to attempt a high-school level ""gotcha."" Boring.

Seems to me you are just digging for confirmation bias as all your examples from several posts ago confirm.  If that is all you are interested in seeing that is all you will see.  

It's too bad, you have traded one addiction for another."
