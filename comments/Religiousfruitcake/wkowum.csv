0,So sexually repressed they can't tell the difference between youtube and porntube
1,How does that even make sense. A creep could rub one out to a woman he passed on the street and saw for a split second would that count as well then.
2,"Modern problems require modern solutions.

Beat them at their own game."
3,I'm sure they'll be saying that rule is only for females
4,"I'm gonna rub one out to a world map, now the entire world isn't going to heaven."
5,As if there is a woman anywhere in this world that NOBODY has ever rubbed one out while imagining.
6,As it should be.
7,"I've rubbed one out to a lot of men, i think heaven's just gonna be empty at this point."
8,"They think quite a lot of their power.  I wonder what their faaaavorite oppression is.  Manifesting random rules for hell is pretty powerful!! 

That response  tho 😂 not advice err anything but I wonder if some brilliant gonzo-journalist-type would surprise them in their comfort zone, with proof of someone masturbating while looking dead in their eyes.  It could spawn an orgy in the masturbation theater, which becomes ironically hot and itself goes viral.  At their beautiful EXPOSED flesh, candy for OUR eyes.  Now to hell as is mandated 🙃 why be so sexy, boys?? How dare you..

Don't MAKE them watch it, that'd be unethical and abuser abusing the abuser-type behavior. But they should have a copy just in case they'd be more comfortable knowing for sure."
9,What exactly are they watching on YouTube. Lol.
10,It was brave of you to take one for the team. Well done!
11,"Think about these three the next time you rub one out. Wait till a tenth of a second before you blow you wad or your dick will shrivel, but if you can pull it off the ALL go to Hell."
12,Truth. If they make me commit sin its their fault by their rules
13,"Honest question: why tf is everyone starting to self censor words in their titles and pics? 

Replacing one word with an asterisk doesn’t mean people don’t know what you’re saying…"
14,![gif](giphy|JmD9mkDmzvXE7nxy7j|downsized)
15,Why the fuck do people censor words in screenshots? It's so fucking childish and ridiculous.
16,"Like, masturbate over them (physically) or masturbate over them (in thought)?"
17,"""Islam is feminist""

Also islam: ""a man agressed a woman so we punished the woman"""
18,r/suddenlygay
19,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
20,Lmao
21,Are people on screen really people? They are just a bunch of pixels.
22,"Thank you for posting. Please review the rules. Here are a couple of gentle reminders:

25,That's what heroes do.
26,Op has the perfect username for this sub....
27,"I wonder how many of these people actually believe insane nonsense such as this and how many just parrot these things because its expected of them. Or even worse, if some of them just keep coming up with this stuff because it gives 'points'."
28,"fuck it just rubbed one out to the globe, none of you fuckers are getting in now"
29,He took it personally
30,Can we stop posting this now?
31,"Bold, even foolish of you to assume people have not rubbed it off to YT vids"
32,"Well, tbf there are fetish vids on YT."
33,"If you acknowledge the existence of actual porn—hell. Maintain innocence (i.e. pretend ignorance gawd likes). Don’t be a YouTube…attractor of..masturbators.? I think is the real takeaway, if we weren’t being so cynical /s

Edit bc I'm too sensitive to being misinterpreted + downvoted..  I'd rather be downvoted for over-explaining my dumb joke (it is decided). 
Please apply the following function around my original text:

*From inside the unfortunate, possible heads of the target audience males + content creators of the featured paradigm*

[hard exit](* function), 
     write.'we' as in 'yourself and viewers of this reddit post'

Oi.. still clunky 😐 the weirdos think ankles are porn, punishable with hell by authority of subjective arousal and/esp. orgasm (male variety only kind known to the holy prophecy so...).  And (or?) death.  The 2nd thing 1st.  

It sucks.  Is what I mean."
34,"The logic is: the dresscode is to wear the burqa. Every sin done because you didn’t wear a burqa is your fault. If a man watched you on the street while driving a car and rode into the wall, it’s the woman’s fault. She should have worn the hijab.

But the same things happens with men. Music is haram. If a muslim puts that on youtube, everytime someone listens to that you get a sin. If you build a mosque, everytime some prays in it you get good points."
35,"I know you make it sound completely unreasonable (and it is), but lots of strict muslims would heavily restrict their female family members from leaving the house following a similar line of reasoning, and I use the word “reasoning” here very loosely."
36,It's big problem when the head is locked firmly in the past
37,Also beat meat.
38,So it's perfectly okay if you rub one out to a dude?
39,A true hero
40,I beg to differ because I exist
41,Amen bro if thous a milf thou shalt get a one rubbed to
42,i'm literally right here
43,"There are, but only a small fraction"
44,It's not the content. It's literally just people jerking off over anything and they're placing the blame on women.
45,"You're still communicating the word, which is surely the issue. The end result is I hear it in my head, either way."
46,In thought.
47,There are non-fetish vids on YT that people masturbate too.
48,What.
49,"It does suck. I still didn't get your joke, but I gave you a pity upvote because you made an effort to explain it."
50,You have adhd don’t you? (Me too)
51,comment failed to process.
52,"Wait music is haram?? Why, damn."
53,But of course
54,/r/beatmeattoit
55,you can fuck them too but only if you top
56,I gotcha bro
57,"If it makes you feel any better, in my mind, you look like ""Dead Calm""-era Nicole Kidman, and, as of 7 minutes ago, you are condemned to Hell."
58,Not anymore
59,"Send me a pic fam, I’ll rub one for you 😘

/s"
60,I gotcha sis
61,Also just noticed but I really really love that art in your header! The shading especially
62,"I think my cognitive disorder um flaring up a bit 😅 I suppose it will be a deletable remark, leading a weird path no one would follow. I’ll see myself out.."
63,Part of the joke is that the explanation also sucks.. it’s a meta-inception of.. not good. Your sympathy makes me feel 😌
64,"Ja—I haven’t clowned so unsuccessfully since high school (for sure, since high school 😎)."
65,It has an effect on your brain where it changes your behavior. Everything that touches the brain in the slightest is forbidden. It will make you things you wouldn’t normally do. It can lead up to dancing>with women>getting attracted>intercourse
66,Music is haram and so are drawings of living things.
67,Life is haram for them.
68,Unfortunately r/beatmywifetoit feels relevant too
69,Like a civilized Roman citizen should. It's only gay if you are the bottom.
70,">Not anymore

Oh no meesa disapprarin'"
71,😳
72,"aw thank you so much!! it's pretty old lol, i should replace it with something new- but i'm happy you still like it :))"
73,"I understand how it feels, when you're writing just try to stick to the point."
74,"I up-voted your other two comments here but downvoted your meta-inception of a..... joke, pretty sure that's the real hyper-meta of this situation."
75,"Ah, well of course. Sinful indeed huh."
76,"Yeah, wouldn't want people thinking too much or they might discover religion is bullshit"
77,Extra steps not needed. Just head directly to intercourse.
78,so basically no originality or creativity then?
79,"In fullest “holy shit dude, just pull up already 🤫” disclosure, my downvote of shame was formatted to look like mock computer code originally. Then it actually did stuff and the apparent codeness was lost. But was it.. lost? Or stumbling around my skull for a pathway that never. Should have. Existed 😐 no nerd could have laughed and I appreciate that now.

A neurologically atypical person might be able to follow the thread. Well, one can.. Yea ADHD 🙄 apologies to everyone for this overspill of derpy brain activity, which isn’t. Stopping. [this is part of an unplanned comedy arc that you’ll all see… I’ll see myself out again]

This could have dissolved in my head but.. here we are.."
80,Tells you all you need to know about a religion when it forbids music and art.
81,It will also make you like guys for dancing with chicks.
82,"Honestly, who has that kind of time for the extra stuff?!"
83,Literally the two things that keep me alive
84,Religious fundamentalists want good  feelings to only come from the church/religion. So they ban everything else that feels good. So when you’re praying you think that good feeling is gods. There’s obviously more to it but this is one of the main reasons.
85,Right???
