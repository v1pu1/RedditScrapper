1,So... aliens had butt sex with titans and now we have monkey pox? Am I understanding this right?
2,The most amazing thing about this is that he is actually SMARTER than his followers.
3,"Ok, I'm lost. So do the Baptists believe in alien overlords instigating sodomy to cause monkeypox? Because this guy is a Baptist preacher, right? 

I thought only Scientologists, Seventh Day Adventists and Mormons were the ones to intertwine aliens with their religions? Baptists too? 

I'm confused. My head hurts. Either I'm dumb, or they are dumb. Help undumb me."
4,That smirk suggest he is going to rake in a lot of cash from them suckers
5,I guess we're back to sodomy being exclusively defined as ass pounding between two dudes again.
6,I mean‚Ä¶ if people look at the board and then go and tithe because they believe him this nonsense I don‚Äôt feel bad for them
7,Oh my word I actually want to hear the sermon that goes along with this one.
8,"Never been a fan of picturing a random person and suggesting they have a ‚Äúpunchable‚Äù face, it‚Äôs usually kinda cruel and without context.

But that smug look while he‚Äôs godsplaining a disease while suggesting some supernatural connection makes me open to it.  Not saying I would, but given the context of *this* face and it‚Äôs expression, I do understand."
9,"Sins of Sodom? Like the part where they were prideful and didn‚Äôt help anybody?

Oh? That‚Äôs not what they were talking about? Dammit."
10,this shit reminds me of those wacked out diagrams of heaven I was supposed to memorize in Mormon sunday school
11,"**PRIVILEDGE**

**COLLEDGE**"
12,Now it all makes since.
13,Anybody have a link to the original sermon? I need a good laugh today and am too skeptical to believe that this photo depicts something that was serious.
14,Leave the aliens out of it!
15,"Nephalim....

OK let's play pastor is heretic (a fun game I like to play with Christians) 

The Nephalim are the spawn of angels and humans created when a sect of angels known as the watchers became lustful of human women, and caused the 2nd fall of angels (1st fall was lucifers rebellion) the Nephalim were a race of near imortal giants and they threatened humans existence so God sent noahs flood in part to wipe them out. 

Thus the nephalim were destroyed by God. 

To belive nephalim still exist is to believe God missed some, and thus belive God made a mistake and can make mistakes, this denys the omnipotence of God and is thus Herasy."
16,This dude was definitely inspired by Mr Garrisons flow chart
17,there's no way he put science in quotes üíÄ
18,"I mean, aliens have a track record of liking butt stuff, bit of a shame someone didn't check if their partner was clean and now we have an epidemic going around."
19,I‚Äôll pray for your undumbening. You‚Äôre welcome.
20,"Well we‚Äôre all dumb. 

I too am dumbfounded though lol. For once I actually want to hear a sermon lol. Just want to hear him try to tie that all together"
21,"Feels like some flavour of Heaven's Gate fruitcakery, no idea how aliens fit into that guy's denomination but all the more power to the guy (so long as he isn't being a dangerous, misinformation spewing dumbfuck, that is.)"
22,Suckers? Are those some kind of alien appanages use for sinful sex?
23,"For all the wild conspiracies these people come up with, they sure lack imagination in some areas."
24,"compassion for the conned

contempt for the conman  


but theyre still morons"
25,‚ÄúGodsplaining‚Äù lol I love that.
26,[Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdso9Ss8RSc) I've seen a few of his sermons/lectures. He makes diagrams like this all the time and his congregation takes them seriously. It probably makes as much sense in or out of context. I worry for anyone who doesn't watch his videos purely for entertainment.
27,it might be on youtube
28,Please tell me there ISN'T a monkey involved. I didn't see it on the whiteboard
29,It might be on youtube.
30,Point for creativity I guess?!
31,staahp you are going to drive me in to sin of lusting for alien appanages
32,That would suck
