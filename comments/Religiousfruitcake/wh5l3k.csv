1,"Wouldn't tecreating dinosaurs be a sin too?  Isnt god the only one that create life? The whole premise behind jurassic park was man manipulatimg dna, acting as god to recreate life.  Why would she let her kids watch any of those movies."
2,"These people love to brag about how weak their faith is. ""When something promotes sin, we no longer watch or listen to it."" Personally, I'm able to see and consume media I don't agree with and still hold on to my own morals."
3,I hope that kid moves out as soon as they can.
4,"So, being gay is a sin, but lying isn't? Weird."
5,What a horrible mother.
6,Twenty years from now: Why does my daughter tell everyone I'm mentally ill?
7,"I‚Äôll never expose my kids to stuff like this! They need wholesome biblical content, possibly starting with Genesis 19, where Lot‚Äôs daughters get him drunk and have sex with him. /s"
8,Religion is child abuse. Need i say more?
9,Congratulations with your grand kid in 9 years.
10,"I'm surprised she's ok with her kid learning about dinosaurs, since it contradicts her creation myth."
11,That‚Äôs so horrible. That poor child.
12,I bet that little girl's mom never kisses her because it is too gay.
13,Christian mom grooms daughter to be a god fearing homophobe.
14,"My nephews have grown up knowing nothing is abnormal about a man having a boyfriend, or a woman having a girlfriend - because there‚Äôs *nothing abnormal* about this. This is parenting done right.

I have a cousin who knew he was different to everyone else from the age of 7. This was back in the day when same sex relationships were ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, and he really struggled with his sexual identity and mental health growing up. We need to stop doing this to people."
15,"She‚Äôs obviously crazy, doesn‚Äôt even know how to    correctly use seen vs saw. /s"
16,"The Ten Commandments tell you not to steal, but going by the watermark in the bottom right she clearly stole Windows 10."
17,The univers was created by God 6000 years ago. Why is she even watching dinosaurs ü¶ï? Aren‚Äôt they a conspiracy theory to deviate Christians away from the wisdom of the book of genesis?
18,"i‚Äôm a lesbian, the urge to go up to this mom and go ‚Äúi‚Äôm a lesbian, BOO‚Äù is so powerful rn"
19,Well let's just hope that this mom didn't let her kid watch Jurassic World Dominion.
20,"I can agree this is probably just another homophobic Karen right here, but honestly I‚Äôm not too fond of heterosexual kissing in shows meant for 5-10 year olds either."
21,I think the mom is just upset that a cartoon for kids is teaching her 5 year old kid about sex and having lesbian relationships. I Dont care who someone chooses to love not my business but why do they have to go out of the way to put this kind of stuff for my 5 year old to see. they should let the parents decide when they feel their child is ready to learn about sex.
22,"Oh for fucks sake, yeah she might be a religious nutjob but why on earth are we showing sexual stuff (straight or gay) on a kids show?

And for all of you on your high horses  commenting above bashing the mom, would you be okay with your kid/niece/nephew watching this if it was straight?"
23,Did she just spoil a sub plot between Yaz and Sammie on Jurassic Park: Camp Cretacous? Sonofabitch.
24,Fucken spoilers. I was actually enjoying this show. I'm like half way through season 4.
25,Remember when conspiracy nuts used to call themselves woke? Why did it flip?
26,Any real christian knows that dinosaurs are just one of Satan's awesome tricks to make humankind realize that he's fucking dope.
27,"Christians will argue that these recreated dinosaurs don't have souls, so they're not really alive.

They're very good at waving away any inconsistencies you could bring up."
28,"Perhaps there are some Christian denominations that have issues with any kind of genetic manipulation, but I don't know that they all do. I think in this case it wouldn't necessarily be problematic, because you are not 'creating' life, simply creating the conditions for it to be re-created. That being said, the first attempts at reviving extinct animals is likely going to be some sort of elephant/mammoth chimera, not a full-blown dinosaur as it existed in its natural state. For those that do have a problem with it ethically, it's also unclear where the line gets drawn on things like selective breeding, hybridization, grafting, etc."
29,And also are probably a decent human being without a man in the sky threatening you to.
30,"It‚Äôs about consuming good, quality content... If my kid is watching garbage on tv it‚Äôs getting turned off. I‚Äôm not letting them consume it just because it‚Äôs out there. (And no this isn‚Äôt about girls kissing)."
31,She‚Äôll move in with her girlfriend right after high school.
32,"So wholesome!!! 
It's wholesome, god approved, not consensual, biblical sex! A lot better than a sinful and evil homosexual kiss!"
33,Mmmm. Emissions like horses.
34,"Well, there‚Äôs always the poophole loophole."
35,Gods will
36,Where is the sex teaching you‚Äôre talking about?
37,"Do you honestly think that in this children‚Äôs cartoon about kids meeting dinosaurs at a summer camp, that the characters none older than 15 are discussing sexual intercourse? They‚Äôre not. They are dating each other. This show isn‚Äôt targeting five year olds, it‚Äôs targeting middle schoolers. Also, the phrase ‚Äúwho someone chooses to love is very telling‚Äù."
38,"Delusion at its finest, two girls kissing isn't something to piss yourself about, it's just a loving, healthy relationship like any other. How is that hard to understand?"
39,A kiss‚Ä¶between cartoons‚Ä¶is sexual? I have some bad news about every kids movie featuring a women protagonist.
40,If you think kissing is only sexual you're a lost cause
41,"That's interesting.  If lab created dinosaurs dont have souls, do IVF test tube babies not have souls either?"
42,Children‚Äôs TV is incredibly trash. Zapped through my TV the other day and it‚Äôs honestly a shame how bad it‚Äôs become
43,"Lol‚Ä¶ kissing on the cheeks or a peck on the lips is definitely not sexual. But full on lip lock mouth action? 

I‚Äôm good thanks, you might wanna reconsider who‚Äôs actually lost.

Edit : why don‚Äôt you go ahead and answer the second question in my original comment?"
44,"Good question... for Christians. I'm not a Christian. I don't believe in 'souls' so the question is moot.

But I would like to hear a Christian answer it."
45,"Im just worried if she's concerned with her kids seeing sins, that whole movie franchise is a big no no."
46,If anyone followed the Bible religiously they'd drive themselves nuts from their prison cell.
