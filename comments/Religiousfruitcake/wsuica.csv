1,"> please don't say science

__The current best method of explaining__ and the person want the person not use science.

I don't know, sounds fishy."
2,"People really think of science as a force of nature, like atheists see something happen and think ""science did it.""

That's not what science is.  That's what God is.  We're not replacing God with science.  Science is how we find answers that don't require supernatural explanations.  

If you found a pie in your kitchen, and you didn't know where it came from, you could think ""Oh, elves have left me a pie!""  Or you could ask the people in the house which of them made the pie.  

This person is saying ""oh yeah, well if it wasn't elves, then tell me where the pie came from.  And don't say 'asking.'"""
3,"These people only have one argument.

Explain how everything exists then. How can it be so perfect? And then say don't say big bang & shit. What the fuck do u want to hear?"
4,"""Explain everything, but don't use the method that explains everything"" such a fucking joke. Holy shit. But then, they say it is ok to claim god, just because a book says so, and it is mostly right despite being rewritten a bunch? Well, first, it isn't mostly right. Or right at all. Literally every single thing that can be tested or checked against other sources, is wrong. No exceptions to this. Every last thing the bible says that we can check in some way has been proven to be completely wrong. At best, the things it says have no mention anywhere else or anything to back them. And in most cases, all other sources go against the biblical account and show us what the bible says CAN'T be right. 

So, a book that has been shown to be wrong in countless ways is a fine source, but can't use the scientific method, which is shown to work again and again. Science works, that is a fact. Not to be confused with ""everything science says is right"" as that isn't true. We often get a wrong answer. But that is what is so great about science. It tells us when we got a wrong answer, and lets us correct it. Religion does no such thing."
5,"As soon as this brainwashed moron says “..and please don’t say science.”  We with functional brain cells already know our position. 

Never argue with idiots. It’s a waste of time. We simply can’t reason with the unreasonable."
6,The Wizard Of Oz has been printed a bunch of times too.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
7,"Gotta love circular arguments.  Years ago I was in a ‘discussion’ with a fundamentalist who believed the Bible was factual, so I challenged him to tell me why, if everybody is descended from two people, there are not only multiple races but totally different Creation stories from different cultures (I collect Creation stories).  Of course, in his mind, that was all part of God’s Plan but had no answer.  On an unrelated note, in traditional art why are Adam and Eve always depicted with navels?"
8,I dont make up stories when i dont know the answer to a question.
9,Their lack of a logical argument hurts my head.
10,"""It's in the Bible and yeah, it's been rewritten a bunch of times.""

How can these nutcases not see the major red flags in that sentence alone? How can they trust the word of book that's been rewritten and retranslated hundreds upon hundreds of times?"
11,"Well you can’t say god when trying to explain it, because god has no explanatory power. 

We wouldn’t say science to explain it, we’d reference the processes elucidate for us through the scientific method. That explain so many of the things we used to appeal to magic for, with actual explanatory power. 

Saying god did it is no more an explanation than saying a fairy farted it into existence."
12,sum
13,And Odin said LET THERE BE LIGHT!
14,"""Don't say science!""

""Don't say God.""

""BuT tHe BiBlE aNd GoD aNd My FeElInGs!"""
15,"I don't have to know how the earth and all the life on it came into existence to disbelieve your story. Just because I don't know how something happened doesn't make your explanation right, it just means I don't know everything. If I ask who left this present under my Christmas tree, and you tell me it's from Santa, I don't have to know who it came from to not believe it came from Santa."
16,"\>People thinking that science *does stuff*

Science is what we use to know what stuff does what. Shit doesn't just *happen* cuz *science.* How the earth got here is a pretty fucking complicated question, but what the hell. Just say god did it, then you don't need to hurt your head trying to learn stuff"
17,"Judging by the English used, wild guess is that these people didn't do a lot of science class.

And yeah, that makes me sound snobby but FFS, these barely literate people have to be aware that at some level they might not understand how these things work, but there are people out there who went to college and do know.

It's a type of ego-centric arrogance I see in creationists, that they think 'I don't know how this all works, therefore nobody does thus... God did it'."
18,"Sob it goes down the rabbit hole until; so where did your god come from?

Then all of sudden, that just exists and came from nowhere.

Despite no evidence their particular god was not shitted out of the ass of a giant cosmic space rabbit"
19,Sum of it is mostly true
