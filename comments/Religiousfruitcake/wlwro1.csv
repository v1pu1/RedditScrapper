16,"Frankly, I’d find your proposal of your insistence on the qualities of his love quite ludicrous. Especially if we were to invoke scripture here."
17,How is this not a r/selfawarewolves moment?

19,"Well, if you want to get that involved, we could start with when the biblical god lied to Adam when he said that the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil would kill him. (Genesis 2:16-17) When he found out that Adam and Eve did eat that fruit, he manually cursed Adam to work to death and Eve to painful childbirths. (Genesis 3:16-19) He did not forgive that. And would a loving god destroy the men and animals of the world to try and eliminate evil (Genesis 6:5-7) only to fail at his job and concede that evil will still be in every person’s heart from childhood? (Genesis 8:21)

And that’s a start. I’d encourage further study on the subject. But I doubt you will look into it further."

21,"So…no mention of Adam being a demigod anywhere within the creation story in Genesis at all as well as no mention of the biblical god forgiving Adam and Eve at all. That’s adding one’s beliefs into scripture. That’s quite a dishonest argument to try and prove God is “so loving”.

And again, that would mean that God failed at getting rid of evil. Also worthy of mention is that some versions of Isaiah 45:7 do have God say that he creates evil. Others say he creates disaster.

Did you even read the Bible? Or did you swallow a load of apologetics from a quack?"
22,"Fuck, youre right I misused the word. English is 2 language, and that is what google hinted at in translation. Oh, come on, you know what I meant"
