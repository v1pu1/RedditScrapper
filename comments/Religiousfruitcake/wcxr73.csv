1,You mean that knowledge is taking the place of superstitious nonsense? Shocker!!!
2,Farther is used when speaking about literal distance. Further is used when referring to figurative distances. These fruitcakes need to further their education.
3,Education... a direct threat to religious sensibilities.
4,The sad irony is that public schooling was initially championed by religious groups as a means of bringing literacy to the masses...so they could read their bibles.
5,No wonder why majority of religious folks are airheaded lol
6,"So, ""faith"" is belief in somethin without requiring evidence.  Now why would education be bad for something like that?

Seriously religion is the most obvious scam I've ever seen, and yet the most successful."
7,How do you respond to someone who makes your argument then stares at you triumphantly?

9,"Yet Jesus Himself said, “Seek the Truth, and the Truth shall set you free.”   Truth and facts = knowledge, knowledge gained is an education, therefore Jesus wants us to be educated."
10,The glorious words of the prophet Herpduuurt.
11,According to this only uneducated people are religious. Thinking for yourself is evil?
12,"If your religion is incompatible with reality, that’s not a debunk of reality."
13,Saying the quiet part out loud
14,God and his preachers sure do like themselves some ignorant suckers
15,Goddamn right.
16,That’s why the cults keep women from getting any higher education!!!
17,Too many mistake malice for stupidity. Do not underestimate these fucks.
18,"Thinking instead of rehearsing, turns one away from strange claims."
19,Can confirm. Even had a pastor pray with me about it but they couldn’t demonstrate a repeatable cause and effect mechanism so it didn’t help.
20,"""blessed are the minds too small for doubt."""
21,It's almost like worshiping god is stupid.
22,Slow down there Mao Zedong
23,Couldn't have said it better myself
24,Couldn't have said it better myself
25,They put the quotes around the wrong word

27,"the only people i know who use ""education"" as an insult.

="
28,Exactly!  We need more education.
29,That's the plan!
30,"Stay in school, kids."
31,"I’ve got 2 bachelors degrees, how much more education do I need before I can’t even fucking see God in my rear view mirror?"
32,"If you look around the world. Better quality of life always = less religious 

And the opposite is true"
33,This is not the burn they think it is
34,From “Ignorance is bliss” to “Ignorance is Blessed”

38,"I remember I passed by a church sign that said something like, ""Studying for finals is no excuse to take time away from God."" or something like that. 
I saw this in Albuquerque when college finals were due."
39,"Yes but, really there's a little more to it. Let me explain. The more educated we become, the further we move away from control. Religious institutions have always been against adequate education. At least the Christian ones have. That's why, in the past, the only people who could read the Bible and thus ""share"" it's contents with the common folk were priests. That way no one could question the interpretation or the skewing of verses. Religion has always been about controlling others. Not God, not even superstitious nonsense. That superstitious crap is just a tool. The goal is control and power."
40,"To be fair, English is a fucking mess of a language: your & you're, to too & two, there their & they're."
41,Can’t expect good grammar from someone who is anti-education. That’s as absurd as asking them to vote sensibly in an election.
42,Or quite possibly closet atheists knowing which buttons to push to get their way.
43,"Yeah, look how they portray Lilith."
44,">	Thinking for yourself is evil?

Yes it is. You are supposed to do what you are told.  You don’t want to make Jesus mad.  He can have a temper."
45,"Yeah, and despite exceptions such as UAE and Saudi Arabia being wealthy, the quality of life is brought down by the lack of human rights"
46,"As a native English speaker,

English is DEFINITELY a fucking mess.
No question about it."
47,"I know how to use all of those examples. Why? Because I have an education. I think if YOU’RE going TO criticize having an “education” on YOUR public sign, then you should know the correct usage of them TOO."
48,English is just 13 different languages in a trench coat pretending to be a singular language
49,"Satire?

I hope it's satire..."
50,"It's not just that. In Istanbul where I live. The more religious the area is, the shittier it is. In every possible metric you can think of.

You go into the good districts, the good neighborhoods and suddenly you see an 85%.

We're talking about the same city, so the laws are not different, yet somehow the religious end up being in the shitty neighborhoods. And the secular end up in the better neighborhoods."
51,"Because they’re clearly English speaking. So, why criticize getting an education when you can’t even put up a grammatically correct sign? WHAT AM I MISSING HERE? Are we defending these idiots?"
52,Yes indeed.
53,English mugs other languages in dark alleys and goes through their pockets for loose grammar.
54,Me or the sign?  Because I'm not being satirical.  The English language is indeed a mess.
55,"Clearly we aren't defending them. Thought that'd be just a tad bit fuckin obvious. Why would we even be here if we were into defending religious idiots.

We are simply stating that the English language is a mess in and of itself (just like them actually). Kinda wraps it all together I guess."
56,It really is compared to other languages. No idea why you're being downvoted.
57,"They probably think I'm defending the sign, which I, as a Satanist, am in no way doing."
58,"Also, a Satanist, but that’s far beyond the point. You’re defending their clear lack of an education. Which I don’t get. Who gives a fuck if eNgRiSh iS hUrD? You don’t post a sign shitting on having an education, display a lack of having said education, and then get expected to be taken seriously. Fuck that. Do it right or don’t do it at all."
59,"I completely agree, but still, English is a mess."
