1,It’s because those things aren’t being used to justify human rights atrocities. Unlike the Bible.
2,"Imagine a political figure claiming that a fortune cookie, horoscope, science journal or newspaper “told them” what to do and how to govern."
3,When a news source tells you that a 600 year old man built a giant boat I won't believe that either
4,"Assuming The Bible had any authority, where would that authority come from? It would come from God. 

But it wasn't written by God, as is illustrated in this meme. 

On the other hand, if a science textbook or a scientific study has authority, it is not due to who wrote it, but by it's ability to make precise & accurate scientific predictions. 

And that is the entire discussion, from begining to end, on the difference between religous scripture and scientific literature."
5,Newspapers and science journals usually offer some kind of proof. Im cool if we lump the bible in with horoscopes and fortune cookies.
6,They think we believe in horoscopes and fortune cookies?
7,"Horoscopes and fortune cookies are a lark, not something to take seriously.

Newspapers vary in quality and are only as good as they have to be. Take things with a grain of salt.

Scientific journals require you to share your data and how you interpreted it, other scientists can look at the work and critique it, try to replicate it, and report on their results. Sometimes the journals do screw up, but they issue retractions and allow for discourse. They aren't meant to be the final word on anything, but the update on the state of the science.

The Bible is the only one of these that demands you not question it. The only one that says you should take it as the absolute truth because I says you should take it as the absolute truth."
8,No one who doesn't trust the Bible mistrusts it simply because it's written by men.
9,"News flash! Modern science beats Bronze Age mysticism! Next up, study confirms toast is a breakfast option"
10,"Soooo they're admitting it was written by man? Comparing it to the other examples, that means it was also pulled out of the ass by man and not divinely inspired at all lmao"
11,Yup these people can't distinguish between fiction and non fiction. Worst fandom.
12,"Wonder what has more strawmen

Every cornfield in the world or conservative media"
13,That is what we call a false equivalency!
14,No one says this.
15,"The Bible was written by a man who claims the word came from god, so it’s gods words. A newspaper was written by a man who happens to be a newspaper writer. Science journals are written by people who happen to be scientists. They don’t claim something that can’t be proven."
16,"ah, yes; i too believe the papers i read are quoting the works of an omnipotent god"
17,Equivocation of fortune cookies and science… seems logical
18,"I don't ""trust"" or ""distrust"" the Bible. I feel the same way I do about the Quran or Bhagavad Gita. It's a holy book, it's not even the only one.

It happens to be the most popular one but so what? One of the holy books would have to end up ""winning,"" right?

The fact that Christians had so much power for so long, ironically, has more to do with science than religion. It's called guns and really nice boats."
19,"Maybe because science journals and newspapers. Discuss and provide support for claims/experiments or stories. That can be fact checked or replicated and tested in the case of science. Also standards for news reporting and journalism exist. 

Also science isn't used to justify taking away rights or being just purely awful towards people that  are minding their own business.  Science of any form also has ethical guidelines now because of horrific experiments in the past.
Such as the Tuskegee syphilis study. Which  led to the creation of the belmont report.

The Belmont Report identifies basic ethical principles for conducting research that involve human subjects. It also sets forth guidelines to assure these principles are followed throughout the research process.  

Psychology for example has very strict guidelines governing research on humans and animals.  Guidelines, standards and ethics exist so people don't repeat experiments like  Tuskegee or the Stanford Prison experiment (article below).  When conducting research with people getting consent to participate is always a must. In the case of animal research. If there is a way to avoid using them as subjects that is usually done instead. Certain things like the study of cancer don't really work without living beings unfortunately.

20,"When someone says you can't trust the half-naked guy on the street corner talking to himself, shitting on the sidewalk and then smearing it on his face and telling everyone that he's god...**but they trust science journals.**"
21,[deleted]
22,"Yeah, no one actually says that."
23,Those others don’t pretend to be written by the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE
24,I like how horoscope is at the same level as science journals here.
25,"One is claiming supernatural things happened a long time ago that cannot be verified and claiming facts that contradict each other.

The others are making mostly reasonable claims that do not defy the laws of nature. Also, only a fool would believe everything they have ever read in a newspaper."
26,"It's telling the photos they chose to reflect their bemusement: don't know much about the top two, but on the bottom you've got a child, a complete idiot, and a dog.

> > Horoscopes & fortune cookies

No, no, trusting them is on the same level as trusting religious texts.

If the creator of this meme feel scepticism towards these two things they might be dangerously close to the sort of self-awareness needed to understand why people are sceptical of the Bible."
27,I mean… They gotta point. Half of these Reddit links have garbage date and a terrible headline that has nothing to do with the article…
28,"Yeah I'd rate the Bible along with Fox News, horoscopes and fortune cookies. All these were written by man, but at least one of the above is is peer reviewed!"
29,This falls into the category of r/notevenwrong.
30,wow i say this ALL the time! They really got me there! (/S)
31,"we trust journals, articles and all that because that can be corroborated, tested and proven. is there an iota of evidence that proves anything in any scripture as fact??"
32,"Yes, loads of people run around basing their life decisions on fortune cookies.  This totally checks out."
33,"I know it's a low bar, but the fortune cookie and horoscope are probably less false than the Bible and certainly have better moral advise."
34,I take all those things with a grain of salt.
35,"Ah yes, I totally believe fortune cookies actually have magical future telling powers"
36,"We don't ""trust"" science, we constantly test it."
37,Source: trust me bro
38,Or to excuse garbage behavior and opinions
39,they also don’t claim to be the ultimate infallible truth lol
40,"Actually, many non-religioua texts are used to justify human rights atrocities, that is not a uniquely religious crime. Religious texts are only unique in the fact the claim to contain infalible truth about life the universe and everything. Where as the rest of the texts written by man are really just opinion pieces that are used to develop a better understanding but never believing it is the full correct understanding until that too can be proven."
41,"Nah, science (or, somewhat more frequently, [assclownery *pretending* to be science](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience)) has been used to peddle wicked bullshit before. Ever heard of ""social Darwinism""?"
42,And other people had to live their lives according to a horoscope or fortune cookie someone else read
43,Yeah and I can't imagine a fortune cookie getting away with telling me it's ok to own slaves.
44,Isn't that what Reagan did?
45,And also got a pair of every animal in it with the rest of what’s left of humanity. No animal instinct got kicked in whatsoever.
46,"Two of every animal known to that small village on some river bank in the desert 3000 years ago.. So a couple camels and goats.. *IF* the story was loosely based on actual events, Noah was like 40 and managed to cobble together a raft for his family and livestock."
47,"The prophets of science are subject to scrutiny; subject to peer revue and tossed aside if proven in error.  The religious prophet's predictions are always a matter of ""interpretation"" no matter how wrong they prove to be."
48,"My brother has a point here
You can prove the Theory of Electromagnetism any day you want to 
Can you prove how Jesus turned Water/blood into wine? No"
49,Questions 11
50,Or Bubbles.
51,"I mean horoscopes, fortune cookies, and (if they're propaganda) newspapers are definitely used to excuse shitty behavior and in the newspapers case genuine political opinions."
52,"Yep, religion is no different from any other form of ideology in that regard — it's capable of doing wonderful things in the hands of people who can properly understand and see value in things like empathy, compassion, and altruism, but let a sociopath, sadist, narcissist, or other form of asshole get a hold of it, and **there *will* be carnage**."
53,Everyone lives by horoscopes because most of them are just barnum statements that vaguely apply to everyone.
54,Oh... we're not suppose d to do that? My horoscope said virgos can enslave scorpios this month.
55,It seems that was mostly just scheduling.
56,8 humans and 2 of every animal on EARTH. I could go on for a good while about the silliness of that claim.
57,"Yeah like, maybe Noah was an ancient doomsday prepper or maybe they had a dam at the top of the valley and he thought God spoke to him that the dam would break so he built a boat and then one day it rained so hard the dam broke, he loaded his livestock and family in as the whole valley was flooded and everyone died"
58,"Horoscopes and fortune cookies are still superstition. There's little to no religion involved, yes (or at least not Abrahamic religion — there might be some Eastern stuff in there), but it's still superstition."
59,People probably get into them by varying degrees. Everywhere from making out a star chart and trying to use it to make life choices; to just occasionally reading it for amusement but not taking it very seriously. But as delusional as it may seem it has nothing on religion
60,And aquatic animals too. A global flood would destroy their habitat also
61,"Noah's ark just sounds so primitive. Like that's the best thing they could imagine. A lot of water and a big boat. That a single family built by hand and wasn't snapped into existence.  Then they traveled by foot for God knows how long to personally round up the specified number of animals and escort them to this boat instead of sailing to the animals.  Then it rains and the planet is flooded for months.  Just in case a couple stragglers managed to survive a worldwide flood for more than a few days.

Why a flood?  Why not instantly vaporize every wicked person?  How did all the animals on continents not in the middle east get back to their respective habitats?"
62,"Funny thing is, the bible doesn't even agree with itself in this. In genesis 6 Noah is to take a breeding pair of all creatures. In genesis 7 it's one pair of every unclean creature, and 7 pairs of all clean creatures and 7 pairs of all birds."
63,"I've played the NES game, I know that Noah could hold like two full-sized cows on his head in a stack."
64,"Tbh if I was God and wanted to commit global genocide, I would either do something similar to the Flood, since it makes for a fun story, or just make everyone infertile, if I wanted to be more humane"
65,NES was bonkers. Was this a separate game or the Bible Adventures game some church lady's kid brought over once?
66,"It was like a multiple games in one. One of the baby blue ones that was unlicensed 😂

The story behind all that is wild. The company started out making unlicensed secular games but they got legal heat from Nintendo, so they rebranded to Wisdom Tree and gambled that putting a bunch of Bible games in Christian bookstores would scare Japanese businessmen away. They were correct and got by with it 🤣

https://youtu.be/ucGcQH6lN0M"
67,Fantastic. I just looked it up. I need a NES retrospective that covers atuff like this. Years ago I read Console Wars and loved it because of all the insider shenanigans going on back then.
68,"So they weren't even fundamentalists trying to spread propaganda, just some cheapskate businessmen trying to dodge copyright claims. I'm not sure if that makes them better or worse."
69,I played the wisdom Tree games ( and some of the weird secular ones they made ) in the wild because I'm officially old as hell.
70,"I mean they *might* have been legitimately religious themselves to be fair. That part I don't know for sure.

There's some wild stuff though:

[Other unfinished games from the Color Dreams era of Wisdom Tree include a PC game called Hellraiser (another Wolfenstein 3D engine game, it was cancelled upon the release of Doom because Color Dreams felt it could not compete) and an NES game called Maggots, in which the player character is trapped inside a human corpse and must escape while avoiding the maggots which infest it.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_Tree)

I... I kinda want to play Maggots for NES just to *witness* it 🤣"
