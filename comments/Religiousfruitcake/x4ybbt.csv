1,"Oh no, something I can't explain! Quick, throw religion at it!"
2,But isnt Pakistan a muslim country? Arent a there a lot of pious muslims there? Why does Allah want to punish his believers?
3,Why does Allah only punish the poor people? The major cities are currently not under water. The rural areas have been most affected. Make it make sense
4,Amazing how many people are happy to assert that whichever God they worship is a complete asshole.
5,Anything bad = god’s punishment. Anything good = god’s favour. No wonder so many religious idiots don’t believe in global warming.
6,"I don’t get it. In Pakistan women don’t have rights, they murder gay people, children get married, arranged marriages happen, men beat their wives when they’re being meanies🥺😠

why is Alah punishing Moslems?"
7,"Oh totally, maybe they dont rape snd murder women enough for that particular sky daddy im not sure"
8,Can’t Saudi Arabia help them? They’re rich and super muslim.
9,Why does God have to be a part of it why can't it be dry season and wet season? Besides if anyone is mad it would be earth mother.
10,More like punishment for being a military state that is wasting their budget on training terrorists and starting fights instead of building an good infrastructure better handle floods and a good education.
11,"First off, How do you know that? 


Then why would Allah punish a nation of (excessesively) devout Muslims rather than some where else?"
12,For all those rapists?
13,Dog works in mysterious way?
14,"I mean… if ever we where to see divine punishment lol, but why the poor people of Pakistan and not the “western sinners”?"
15,The WHOLE of Pakistan deserves to be punished because….
16,Whackjobs
17,So the muslims are being punished by their god for obeying their god. This shit writes itself.
18,"Tbh, looks like a chantili smudge."
19,god hates people who live in flood prone areas :l
20,"So they finally admit that it's a punishment instead of ""Allah is testing us""?"
21,He is punishing them for.. eh.. not being Muslim enough
22,"It's always a punishment from a God until it's happening to them, then it's just a natural disaster or Satan trying to get them or something"
23,"I know this is completely ridiculous, but you cant juat critic a man based on his beliefs."
24,This shit is done by men for men to fxuk men…
25,"This is so funny to me because Muslim always say that god will punish sinners like in western countries, people are allowed to be gay or have more freedom, they always ALWAYS mention Lut and how god wiped out the entire population because they're sinners, BUT when you mention something bad happened in Islamic countries they will always say it's just a test like literally every single time lol"
26,"that's all religion is - an excuse to never have to say ""I don't know"""
27,"Because if He's as just as they say, He must be getting *really annoyed* with them treating their women like garbage."
28,Prolly cause of how they treat minorities in general over there.
29,Sectarianism.
30,"Tbf, even god can be pissed of His own followers. Like killing someone just because of blasphemy on Prophet or ripping off Quran? I doubt their god even like what they did."
31,"It's a test, every problem is a test of Allah with rewards after death so even if you fail the test die you immediately get the reward now beat that"
32,"It’s only god’s punishment when it happens to someone else, when it happens to them it’s a test from Allah"
33,Don't forget the uderage boys prostitution industry. Disgusting
34,"Because that literally a sins and immoral things i learn at my islamic school at Malaysia ._.
Edit: what i learn from my Islamic school is that treat and respect everyone regardless of their status, religious, race and etc. The things is we do not support LGBTQ however we have to treat them equally as other people aka respect their choice and treat them as human being. In Islam there is like a lot of 'group' that not actually based on Al-quran and sunnah instead they follow what their disire aka make their own cult that claim to be islam' and this is what causes some immoral and extremist.  Also our prophet said that there will open 73 door and only 1 will accept.
Im still young and i may be naive but this is what i learn xD. Sorry for terrible grammar im still learning."
35,Muslim countries rarely help other Muslim countries. They will ask the 'infidels' for help.
36,"Not really, any practicing Muslim who's read Islamic texts would know that Saudi Arabia really doesn't follow the actual rules of Islam"
37,"Tbf, even god can be pissed of its own followers. Every time I see someone got killed in Pakistan because of blasphemy or ripping of Quran, I'm pretty sure their god doesn't even like what they did."
38,prob
39,"Although, Muslims will probably interpret this as ""we are not treating our women ENOUGH like garbage, and must double down"". Because that is the religious mind."
40,"And hiding Bin Laden, and the Taliban, punishing women for rape, killing family members for family honor."
41,"What you learnt is garbage and a lie. The only people that are respected in Islam are straight men.
Idk what bs you learnt about respecting gay people, because under Islam gay people are sentenced to death. I suggest you read the kooran instead of listening to western interpretations"
42,"Bingo. They tend to complain that not enough women are covered up because hijab is not legally enforced like it is in Iran.

But because they have no brains, they don't wonder why Iran is frequently struck with earthquakes despite having Islamic rule."
43,Correction — that is the mind of a sadistic control freak.
44,Bro just stfu
45,No one is treating women like a garbage told you're full of hate and just an asshole that is all
46,"Those last two were included in ""treating women like garbage""."
47,"But according to Muslims, all the things you have mentioned are Allah's work :/"
48,"https://www.islam.gov.my/images/ePenerbitan/Memahami_LGBT_Dari_Perspektif_Seorang_Muslim.pdf

This is literally from JAKIM (Department of Islamic Development Malaysia) 

Quote on the closing 'Although in principle LGBT treatment cannot be accepted based on guidance from the Quran and Hadith, laws and cultural norms of Malaysian society, it does not deny the right of this group to be guided and advised.
This approach is in line with the principle of preaching in Islam to give opportunities to those who commit sin and
sins to improve oneself and obtain God's forgiveness.'

Theres not 'U DEAD BRO CAUSE U GAY.'
because we believe that LGBT  especially homosexual is cause by genes and born with it aka 'god creation.' or natural selection and every rules need to be adapted with the current era or society even prophet once said that 'teach ur children based on your current era' (sorry for bad translation xD)

Again im still learning peace out

Edit: im sorry I don't have english version ;-;"
49,"Ah, a fruitcake has arrived. Welcome. Also, I'll shut up when religious nutjobs stop being the worst human beings on the planet with 100% consistency.  

Have a glorious secular day!"
50,The amount that you've been brainwashed is just sad. I hope one day you can unlearn all the hate and insanity that has been fed to your mind.
51,"That is like evangelicals telling you that floods are god's punishment, I don't believe that bull crap. Whatever you call your god, he is an imaginary friend."
52," “If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, **punish them both.** If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.”
An-nisa 16

Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a **transgressing people**."" 7:81

al-Tirmidhi (1456), Abu Dawood (4462)and Ibn Maajah (2561) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, **execute the one who does it** and the one to whom it is done.”. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

The Sahaabah were unanimously agreed on the execution of homosexuals, but they differed as to how they were to be executed. Some of them were of the view that they should be **burned with fire**, which was the view of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) and also of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him), as we shall see below. And some of them thought that **they should be thrown down from a high place then have stones thrown at them**. This was the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

Some of them thought that they should be **stoned to death**, which was narrated from both ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them). 

Allah (that sick bastard, not that he exists) murdered ""guilty people"" of Lut to destroy them with ""a shower of stones of clay"". Lut and those who believed in him, were to be spared, but his wife was to die in the destruction, with the angels stating that ""she is of those who lag behind"".

But yes, “guided and advised”, sure thing whatever makes you sleep at night bro"

54,"Bro here in Malaysia there's gay people who sleep and live happily, all we can do is adviced yes advice told him what he's doing is wrong and nothing else. All the punishment (not even death) only will be applied when the gay people do anal sex aka liwat. However, if u never commit anything, u just fine. The punishment is like pay, RM35000 = 7.7k USD and will get lashing 6 times only.

Yeah, all the verse you stated is true, however in fiqh jenayah there are things we call takzir Which the punishment is based on the judgement of the judge during trial like other criminal. That's why I said again and again, rules will always be adapted to fit the society. All punishment that u stated is like 1400+ years ago, and we need to change it but still hold the core because it's primitive and doesn't fit.

Here is the link about takzir if you're interested: [https://ms.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takzir](https://ms.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takzir)  (sorry i don't have English version again, but page translator should do a trick)

I think the reason how we both have very different perspective because in Malaysia we live in multi race which make me learn about being open mind and tolerance with one another. I wish you a good life!

p/s: please don't insult Allah I literally didn't even swear 1 word to you ;-;p/s 2: if u asking my qualifications i have my STAM certificate which literally like A-level in islam studies or something also im second year of degree in Biomedical sciences at UPM.

p/s 3: here is some basic example how rules and law of syaria in islam work: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12oET1iwg164OUJwKubqIYaoHFvOqN-Ob/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12oET1iwg164OUJwKubqIYaoHFvOqN-Ob/view?usp=drivesdk)

edit' I'm sorry u have gone through a lot I'm sorry for reading your post but that not exactly how Islam work not here at least  and music It's actually not haram it's only will be haram when u listen to music till u forgot about other priorities and responsibilities same with playing video games etc. Islam never ban entertainment. This is all due to the adaptation I said earlier. I think your peer and environment still follow the 'primitive'. I'm literally playing osu! Making noise and never got beat shit of myself xD I hope u do better bro your parents is something else here the actual truth about music: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v80iezZj3CZrmHUXOProSINxNT90VOM/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v80iezZj3CZrmHUXOProSINxNT90VOM/view?usp=sharing) (thanks god some English academic article) you can just read The View from Contemporary Scholars on Music Entertainment."
55,"Correction, what I think of all religions. Islam is not alone in being misogynistic, superstitious, and tribal in their thinking. 

As an aside, I love Pakistan... gorgeous country and I have 2 close friends from there (one in Islamabad and the other an ex-pat in the US). Both friends are of the opinion that religion is the biggest threat to the region and it should be overcome to fight the 2nd biggest threat (global warming). The 3rd biggest threat is Pakistan's corrupt government, but that's another conversation. 

So no... people don't care about my opinions. But when they see truth in those opinions, they tend to agree. It's also fine to disagree, but I do try to be correct in my opinions, so you do you."
56,"I’m sorry but my brain is actually being tested here.

I don’t care what Malaysia does okay? If the Koran says that gay = bad, then Islam supports that ideology. So no matter what your country or other countries do, gay is still bad according to Islam.

Gay people are only punished by getting fined if they have anal sex like what the actual fuck? They didn’t commit a single crime why should they lose money for enjoying a human desire? And they get lashed? Wtf??
Do I need to explain to you why that’s absolutely insane?

If you’re going to tell me that Islamic laws are outdated then why are you a muslim? You’re not following Islamic laws, you’re changing what your son of a bitch god told you to do, which is murder gay people for absolutely no reason. 

I think why we have different perspectives is because I see gay people as normal humans who deserve to date and marry and fuck whenever the fuck they want to without getting fined or getting lashes (wtf?).
Since you’re a muslim you can’t accept humans having the basic right to love.

I will insult Alah that sick bastard until the day I die.

Music is haram 

“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allah…” [Luqman 31:6]

If you think what the koran says is “primitive”, then you’re not a muslim. Congrats."
57,Aren't your friends upset for saying that about their religion?
58,Saying that religion is a threat is at high level of stupidity
59,"All the resource I stated is literally from Islamic scholar xD and scholar still use al Quran and al sunnah. If you think Islam is very simple that u just need to follow directly what al quran and al sunnah said u are dead wrong. There are things in Islam called al ilmu ushul al tafsir. which is the knowledge that one (especially scholar need to learn in order to actually understand what al Quran said) to You can deny as much as you want, but what happens to you, is literally not how Islam work and I can see how lack of knowledge you have regarding this matter. Do you actually read the whole text :([https://www.islam.gov.my/images/ePenerbitan/Memahami\_LGBT\_Dari\_Perspektif\_Seorang\_Muslim.pdf](https://www.islam.gov.my/images/ePenerbitan/Memahami_LGBT_Dari_Perspektif_Seorang_Muslim.pdf))  Naturally, the chosen path is contrary to the group's vision and mission pro-LGBT. Own sexual orientation it's the same, but a life choice they are different. If life is indeed a choice, of course the pro-LGBT community right to choose to fight for what they believe. As well as Muslim community with SSA and bisexuality who chooses to obey God. They are also have the right to choose to follow a religious path even if it is contradictory with the struggle of the pro-LGBT community. Allah said which means ""For the sake of self human and the perfecting the event (with appropriate equipment with the situation). And inspire it (to know) the path that leads him to evil, and who brought it to pious. Truly successful the person who makes himself available net increasingly net (with faith and good deeds) And indeed empty is the person who makes himself that which is already clean shrinks and sinks cleanliness (due to dirt immorality. (al-Shams 91: 7-10)

Are you sure u do enough research what \`kind' of resource u use other than al Qur'an and Al Sunnah, do you actually read ACADEMIC JOURNAL BY CURRENT SCHOLAR? Or u just blinded your eyes and being ignorant. I think our discussion end here. Because you don't have intellect credential to debate with me and also being rude in debate never the answer. Thank you and I wish you good luck on ur life! :D  


edit: she literally not read my essay sadge i literally stated scholar use al-quran and al-sunnah together the tools which is ilmu tafsir and ilmu al hadis because there is 4 source in determining the islam rules which is al-quran al-sunnah ijmak and qiya however if u not understand those aint my problem because u literally dont understand every single words i said and act like u know anything.[https://muftiwp.gov.my/en/artikel/irsyad-usul-fiqh/1530-irsyad-usul-al-fiqh-siri-ke-3-sumber-sumber-hukum-dalam-ilmu-usul-al-fiqh](https://muftiwp.gov.my/en/artikel/irsyad-usul-fiqh/1530-irsyad-usul-al-fiqh-siri-ke-3-sumber-sumber-hukum-dalam-ilmu-usul-al-fiqh)"
60,"I'm not saying it. They are. And they are also devout Muslims who want to see much more secular rules applied to their country... to avoid becoming the next Taliban-like controlled failed state. 

I'm a devout atheist, and they know it. Both of them are successful professionals that realize that other beliefs exist. So no... they don't get angry at me for being me."
61,"This is what you posted in r/exegypt in reply to a comment. ""Yes, sit down and be killed here in Egypt and wrap your rotten corpses. Pray for the Prophet, O dog. Sit down and grieve like a dog. Get to know your last and hit yourself with boots every day and be afraid."" You are threatening someone because of your religion and you say it's not a threat, you disgusting shit stain of a human."
62,"So to understand this cult I don’t need to read the Koran. I need to listen to what a bunch of men online say?? What about ancient people who were born before these “scholars”? They surely didn’t understand Islam?

You may have “qualifications” but they don’t mean much when you struggle with common sense and critical thinking skills.

edit: and she disappeared, they always do"
63,Man what ever you say this isn't giving you any right to say about followers of specific religion they treat women like gar*age ok ?
64,"…Now I kinda want to know what he replied to. Also, how can someone be an ex-Egyptian? By moving out of the country?"
65,">edit: and she disappeared, they always do

i stated they (scholar) use Al-quran and al-sunnah to determine the laws of islam by using tools which is ilmu tafsir (knowledge in understand al-quran) and ilmu al-hadis (knowledge in understand Sunnah) i bet u dont even know what this is and aint my problem.Secondly yes previous scholar do understand Islam however just like I said the rules of Islam need to be adapted to fit the society whoever its core and based still be hold, so it's not oppose by Quran and Sunnah. If you dont even know what is ilmu tafsir and Ilmu al-hadis which Muslim suppose to learn at age on 8 so they dont misinterpret Islam aint my problem Either.You're literally like a bunch of people that acting know everything, for example: you are flat earth spreading your words (how bad Islam is) however u don't even know how gravity work (the tools ilmu tafsir and hadis) + please read my edit on previous comment+ please learn more. You literally know like 0.01% what Islam is u being closed-minded and not even read my argument aka ignoring it and u not even read my resource perhaps that just straight-up wrong when making an argument also please refrain yourself from replying I'm not going to reply any further because this discussion will be going nowhere since u don't know how RULES OF ISLAM actually work and determined. Its funny how u said about common sense when i showed you how Islam not killing gay people and not ban entertainment LMAO you're indeed ignorant and lack of knowledge also u sound very aggressive for some reason ain't my problem :D"
66,"I'll meet you half way. I'll stop saying it when Muslim-controlled states stop providing evidence that they systematically oppress women daily. To be fair, the US's Christian community has some of the same problems, but they aren't preventing women from going to school (or getting driver's licenses, getting jobs outside the home, having to wear burqa everywhere, talking to non-related men, etc). Stop all that crap and I'll stuff my comments. 

Until then, NOT talking about it is part of the problem. Hope you have a nice day."
67,"whatever makes you sleep at night luv, i think it’s almost time for Asr go pray and hallucinate<3"
68,Yeh that's only on your mind most muslim countries don't do that tho
69,"I know that as well. But there is never a lack of hard-liners in those countries that want to follow Iraq's, Afghanistan's, Yemen's or Syria's lead when it comes to treating women like dog shit. Get the hard-liners out, and I'll gladly oblige you. 

Because the things I'm talking about exist BECAUSE of religion."
