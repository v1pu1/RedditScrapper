1,"*Rampant sex trafficking, sexual abuse and slavery

Saudi Arabia: I sleep

*LGBT characters in a show

Saudi Arabia: ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT"
2,"Things religion has taught me…

Two women kissing is bad. 

A prophet who marries a child is good. 

Excuse me while I marvel at the the stupidity of religion."
3,Because closing your eyes or looking away is inconceivable.  We will never progress as a species with religion imprisoning us forever in the middle ages. God forbid we just accept people as they are.
4,"Lol, they would like to masturbate but that is haraam."
5,Boo religious stuff let the cartoons be gay. Better yet I’m gonna draw Muhammad and Jesus full on making out and allah and saint peter and Moses are gonna fuck!
6,Christians also had a meltdown over the two girls in Lightyear
7,"Are we actually supposed to give a fuck what religious people want?

I sure don't. They can boof their holy books."
8,And we still act like Christians are in any way different from Muslims? What does the alt-right in the west say about this? All religions are the same trash. Change my mind.
9,"Conservatives and islamists should be best friends, really"
10,"I lived in the Middle East for most of my life and one thing I learnt is that they do not like the opposite sex to show affection for one another publicly. The only ones who can do that are the men who kiss each other two or three times on the cheek, sometimes on the nose, every time they meet. So opposite sex couples nope, man on man, no problem."
11,"Thanks for all the VPN money Saudi, now demand the Jizyah tax that is owed or subdue all non Muslim countries.

Please, show the world Islam in all its barbaric glory."
12,"Netflix and Disney are embracing LGBTQ+ themes more and more.  All mainstream media is really. 

It wont be long until all western content is banned in Saudi Arabia which will make VPNs common place."
13,Guess Netflix have way too many women characters who goes whole day without getting beaten up by their husbands/fathers. That's why they want it removed.
14,"Their prophet had sex with a 9 year old girl, but two girls kissing is where they draw the line?"
15,"If you don't like it, don't watch it."
16,To Islamists: well that's nice. Anyway ...
17,Fuck they gonna do about it? VPNs are a thing.
18,"The world doesn't revolve around them and their way of thinking lmao. Why the fuck should Netflix care about ""violating Islamic values"" when religion violates basic human rights?"
19,Wahhhh wahhh wahhh
20,"Dont get netflix then, you bigotted trash."
21,![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB)
22,"Well done, Islam, for advertising a program I'd never heard of before but now kinda want to watch. :D"
23,Change the values ..
24,"Well of course they did, everybody knows men in those countries would spontaneously orgasm themselves to death if they saw this."
25,But but that goes against what my book says!! THEY CANT DO THAT!! MY BOOK SAYS NO!! WHY IS NO ONE LISTENING TO MY BOOK!!
26,If they fucking remove this show from Saudi IPs im gonna fucking download a VPN to circumvent this shit. Fuck you Saudi Arabia i want to watch whatever the fuck i want without you shoving your grimy fingers up its ass
27,"Don't like it? Don't watch it.

Simple as that."
28,Yet they’ll jerk off to it just fine. But showing love?? Nah.
29,Watch it. Or don’t watch it. It’s really that fucking simple
30,Maybe I'm racist but at least I'm fine seeing 2 girls kissing
31,"""We can not allow our people to see normative inclusive naterial. How else will we lie about them. """
32,"I bet they’re pissed at The Legend of Korra, too."
33,"Damn, now I need to watch Camp Cretaceous"
34,Religion suppressor of beliefs for generations
35,Muslim countries keep giving USA conservatives ideas of what to do next
36,Netflix should included a lesbian kiss scene in every show from now on.
37,"Fuck the islamic world. That piece of shit religion can't die fast enough. Its even worse than christianity, and that religion has been fucking people up for longer."
38,GCC citizen here. I honestly can't wait to get the fuck out of here. This years gay panic was roughhhh.......
39,"dinosaurs eating people is OK, but get that gay shit outta here/s"
40,The Saudi's paid for stolen nuclear secrets not hot lesbian smooches.
41,Why do these people care so much about these things don't they have something better to do?
42,"Psychotic. 

If you don’t want to watch it you don’t have to. No one is forcing you to watch a damn thing. See, the cool thing about Netflix is that you can pick and choose what you want to watch from a large selection. 

Religion is a cancer on this planet."
43,Guess I gotta go watch that show now
44,These religious fruitcakes are so damn insecure. Maybe because deep down they know it is all superstition and delusions?
45,"I like how these countries hold these ""values"" and they seem to think that they're going to create a Utopian city called ""The Line"" in the desert. It's laughable..."
46,Soon this will be Texas for violating Christian values… they’re already doing it to libraries…
47,Just fuck Saudi Arabia. Fuck it really hard. Fuck that disgusting medieval desert shit hole.
48,Watch as Netflix wipes their sweat with all the money they make
49,"They are the exact same scumbags who will worship a genocidal pedophile but think, ""nooOOOooOo!!1 GaY EVil!1!!"""
50,WAIT IS THAT IN AN ACTUAL EPISODE???
51,Tell Saudi Arabia to go pound sand up their collective ass (they got plenty of it) and pull out of their market.
52,If they don't know how to have fun I guess they'll have to cancel their Netflix accounts.
53,Spoilers!
54,"should just tell them to go fuck themselves with a cactus, but we all know greed goes before principles."
55,I love how they think this will get anything done
56,"Good thing our US govt sends these people billions of dollars, ICBMs, and jet fighters."
57,"Please add a spoiler alert to this, I am currently watching this show and this is like a massive twist"
58,"Somebody should fly over and release a bunch of gay porn printed on paper.

Biodegradable paper of course."
59,"Oh no…a warning about violating a religion I don’t follow. And these dorks wonder why people won’t listen to them.

Adults who still believe in magic are the absolute worst."
60,"Yes, because gay = bad, obviously 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
61,Maybe gulf arab states can get the sand out of their cracks and just not watch it
62,I hope Netflix's response to this was basically a middle finger.
63,"Ok, this is *widely* off topic, but can anyone explain to me why with all the progress in cgi, most of the time characters' hands still look like a late-90's computer game?"
64,"I always wondered why they don't fetishize lesbians like the west tbh, it's not like it's a good thing, but why did that never happen there? They already think women are objects"
65,OMG THAT SCENE IS DISGUSTING! where can I find that movie so I can specifically avoid it. Please tell me so I can not look at it please
66,Bite me.
67,I'm surprised they saw it.  The numbers show that they spend most of their time watching porn.
68,Chopping peopkes heads off in public kinda violates my values as a human kinda a whole fuck load actually but yer two women kidding oh dear
69,"Sammy and Yaz are arguably the only overall positive portrayal of romance in ANY of the Jurassic franchise properties. The second closest is also from Camp Cretaceous, but ...meh..."
70,"Now they have to read Qur'an and execute according to it.


Who the fuck has time for it.[ That being said I've read it and they have to delete a lot of shit.. a lot of things you wouldn't even imagine from The Office to Naruto ]"
71,"""Oh, why are you so prejudiced towards Middle Eastern immigrants?"" The middle eastern immigrants:"
72,Same people have a poo fetish sesh with prostitutes
73,"Sorry if i sound homophobic, but who the hell pays for netflix if expects to not see queer stuff?, its basically one of the main appeals of the brand, netflix was never known for having conservative content."
74,"If they mean that for the content which Saudis watch, I don't see much trouble. Sure government censorship but this exists in all countries, Also i'm quite sure part of why the government is saying this to appease  people. Saudi people are not that supportive of gays."
75,"What are the ""Islamic values"" to which they refer? Are they anything like ""states' rights""?"
76,Why would Netflix even go there? Even *I* could see that one coming...
77,They get to close my money or their money
78,This is just the tip of the iceberg. Nobody tell OP what they do to actual homosexuals in that peninsula of tyranny.
79,My dumb ass kept wondering what the hell a C compiler had to do with any of this
80,"The average Muslim Is a good person, just as friendly and peaceable as anyone else. The word 'Islam' means peace, or submission.

However, prophet Muhammed pbuh was a massive pedophile with many child sex slaves, and the religion was founded by him. Additionally, many sections of the Qur'an are utter horseshit, like this part:

Sura 2:223: ""And they ask thee concerning menstruation. Say, `It is a harmful thing, so keep away from women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until they are clean. But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as ALLAH has commanded you. ALLAH loves those who keep themselves clean.""

As you can see, because the Qur'an is 1,500 years old, it is horribly outdated (so is the bible, they are both Abrahamic religions) so I believe that certain common Muslim practises, such as banning TV programmes with gay acts like this one, should be reverted.

The horrible sections of the Qur'an should just be taken out, really. It may be the direct word of Allah but these direct words completely go against human rights."
81,"What kind of show is that?

Is that a kids show that has kids kissing each other?

Things have really changed since I watched Eureka Castle or Gullah Gullah Island."
82,"Well girls I believe they're around there mid teen years, it was super cute at the end too"
83,This made me SO HAPPY.  I suspected it from the beginning and I literally squealed.
84,"Many things on TV don't reflect my country's values - think of all the murder you see on TV ... but you don't see me whining about it. If you don't like it, change the channel you bunch of creampuffs."
85,What terrible people
86,Is this a full on smooching scene or a peck on the lips ?
87,Did they condemn the crown prince of Saudi Barbaria when he ordered his agents butcher Jamal Kashogci? Yep. Didn't think so.
88,"I demand you celebrate Christmas, but you know what we all can’t have what we want so grow the fuck up and just don’t watch it."
89,Why doesn’t Netflix just remove all the stuff from their SA counterpart? I am in India and half the things I wanna watch aren’t available anyway.
90,"The main problem that is prolonging this super conservative society in the Arab world is due to it being enforced by sharia law (apostasy laws, anti lgbt laws, blasphemy laws), if the population  doesn’t have a choice to live outside this highly conservative then they will eventually see it as the right one. 

Through statistics it is easy to see that islamic countries without sharia law are much less socially conservative than ones that do have it"
91,religions are just awful we need to ban all religions world wide.
92,If only Atheists got as offended by the religious for shoving their beliefs down others throats as they themselves do.
93,"In my personal experience Muslim people have always genuinely treated me with dignity and respect, no amount of upset people online will change their traditional values. It’s upsetting to some but frankly it don’t think any amount of uprear online will change anything, movements are futile."
94,"2 women on a show: *kiss*

The right: “NOOOOOOOAAARRGRGFHTGTG BUT GEEBUS SAID ITS BAD AND THIS IS ALL PROOF THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS FAILED AND GAY PEOPLE ARE ICKY AAAAAARRRRRRGHHH”

The left: “Muh representation.  Muh agenda.  Somehow this proves that communism works.”

My perverted ass: “YURIFICATION!  YURIFICATION!  YURIFICATION!”"
95,"Great job Saudi Arabia, keep it up 👍🏽"
96,I don’t see how any romantic storyline adds anything to a show like Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous.  Why even add it in?
97,SA has enough money they can make thier own suckass movies and watch those if they want.
98,"Sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and slavery are not really a sin in Islam...

You're allowed to have sex slaves, slavery is alright too ( same story as Christianity pretty much) and sexual abuse is permitted because if a wife refuses to have sex with her husband she gets cursed by angels.

If you're talking about rape? It's obviously not the man's fault but the woman's because she didn't cover herself enough! /s

Narrated Abu Huraira:

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning.""

[Reference: Sahih al-Bukhari 3237](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3237)"
99,I live in Dubai and have a lotta saudi friends. For people who hate the gays so much they gay as hell.
100,"*Islamo-fascist government

US: WOW WHAT A BASTION OF FREEDOM HERE'S A FEW BILLION TO KILL THOSE FUCKIN' YEMENIS!"
