1,What kinda bread does he smell like? A Hot cross bun?
2,So he travelled thousands of kilometres across Asia but he carried the crowbar with him?
3,"If it gives off a ‚Äúbread-like aroma‚Äù and the corpse was preserved with yeast, that gives entirely new meaning to ‚ÄúHe is risen.‚Äù"
4,according to the bible didn‚Äôt jesus ascend to heaven after his resurrection with his physical body?
5,They didn't put the nails in the palms of the hands. Oops.
6,The sad thing is there are probably religious leaders already removing the identifying graphic and then showing it to their believers as being true.
7,"He rose again after 3 days, hung around a bit then got a hankering for Lo mein before rencountering a desert lightning storm and ultimately regretted carrying the Iron crowbar"
8,Sourdough or unleavened bread?
9,He looks like he has a bad stomach ache. Must have been all those loaves and fishes.
10,"> the blasphemer memer

C'mon y'all it's literally right there that it's some dude making a joke"
11,Jesus Jerky!
12,Weekend at Jesus‚Äôs
13,"I mean, I‚Äôm not sure if that would be real. But didn‚Äôt Jesus rise from the dead in his once dead body and eventually rise to heaven in said body? Because if that were the body of Jesus, well‚Ä¶looks like the Bible has something to say.

>‚ÄúBut if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠15:13-14‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Yep. If Christ did not rise from the dead, then Christianity is automatically false and the Christians were gullible idiots. Unless, of course, the Bible is wrong."
14,"Wasn‚Äôt it proven that the people hung on the cross were nailed through their wrists, not their hands?  Also, does this mean Jesus has already returned, but got lost in the desert and died a second time?"
15,He did identify as bread so he should smell like it
16,Wouldn't finding the body of Jesus actually have the opposite effect?
17,He is looking a little un-leavened at the moment.
18,Doesn't look very resurrected to me
19,Meanwhile Chinese anthropologist be like üóø
20,I just cannot believe that anyone would believe this.
21,Can no one read the middle of the image?
22,Checkmate atheist!
23,Scuffed asmongold
24,Canta wait for scientists to do some good old carbon dating
25,"Such a discovery would debunk the resurrection myth and therefore the whole Christianity, wouldn't it. The little circle in the middle says that this is probably a troll. I mean the one who posted it, not the body itself."
26,For a guy with a body made out of bread and wine flowing trough his veins he looks really slim.
27,They found a Chinese Jesus now thats really cheap XD
28,Wasn‚Äôt that bitch supposed to be resurrected?
29,Looks like Nick Cage after a great night out
30,Lmfao! I hope this is being shared without irony in religious groups.
31,He looks a little white
32,Jebus brother buried him there b4 revolting against the Chinese emperor
33,I knew it!!
34,That looks like my uncle Bob. Robe and all. Dude was chill. Miss the guy.
35,A crowbar. üòÇ
36,I guess he had just broke the bread.
37,"Hmm. I thought he was ascended to heaven, body and all? So, *gasp,* this can't be a fake, could it?

/s"
38,"For a guy that‚Äôs supposedly been dead for close to 2000 years he doesn‚Äôt look half bad.

Also, Jesus lived in Israel. How did his dead body get to China? 

Also also, wasn‚Äôt there supposed to be no body, on account of the whole resurrection thing?"
39,"This is likely a modern torture victim, the result of an assassination or a religious wacko tried to recreate the crucifixion on themselves."
40,"Bitch, why you smelling a corpse? Did y'all get THAT close or does his rot smell like a full fledged bakery? Did your mouth water in preparation for eating Mummy Jesus? 

Also why'd he leave his body behind if he rose from the dead three days later and ascended into the SKY? Did he say, ""aight, guys duck and cover, I'm leaving this here!!!"" And then suddenly his soul separated from his mortal form and the body of Christ landed back on earth with all the THUMP of a weirdly shaped bread hitting the kitchen counter?"
41,Today I learned that Romans had crow bars.
42,Oh definitely Jesus‚Äôs body
43,"I always get the urge to rewatch [""Don Verdean""](https://youtu.be/7Kf1WAcs6gs) when I see stuff like that."
44,The dude abides man
45,Why would murican Jesus be in china?
46,Thats just a pic of Asmongold
47,His hands when examined seemed carpentery.
48,I‚Äôll race you across North America on horseback for it
49,I‚Äôll worship it if my calls print
50,Ah fuck is He okay
51,‚ÄúKeep on truckin -Jesus‚Äù
52,And there's also enough pieces of the cross of Jesus for sale to build a high-rise condo.
53,Wait but his body was risen and ascended to heaven. That WAS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT RIGHT?!
54,Corpus Christi
55,"That‚Äôs not Jesus, that‚Äôs Thom Yorke"
56,"""Faint Bread-Like Aroma"".  JFC."
57,Didn't Jesus have a bodily resurrection and a bodily accent to heaven
58,"Huh, neat"
59,"Well, we've got a Norwegian Jesus for all the white people.  It's only fair that the Chinese have their own version of Jesus."
60,Who put him there the G-Man?
61,I knew it! Jesus was Asian all along!
62,"LoL, looks more like Nicolas Cage then jesus."
63,And then a crippled guy and an executioner inexplicably found his remains
64,The Facebook page that shares this is a fake account
65,God daaaaaamn
66,You nailed it.
67,Maybe... I'd imagine he smells like stale church wafers.
68,Nice
69,A bread that has enough fungi for them to get this kind of hallucinations
70,Too soon!
71,"Jesus Crust, that was a zinger."
72,Slap a bit o' butter on him and I think he might be super tasty!
73,Gordon freeman energy
74,We kneaded this post. Ye're doin' the Lord's work.
75,"So, another bites the crust?"
76,Maybe that‚Äôs what was meant all along
77,You get an award ü•á
78,ü§£ü§£ü§£
79,"Yes, but the skipped the chapter where he comes back as a mob-hit."
80,"Pretty sure from catholic school: 
jesus soul went to hell for the 3 days, then reanimated his corpse (like a lich, with wounds) to tour the apostles and let thomas finger him... then took the corpse to heaven with him. Only he and his mother mary went to heaven full bodied, she did supposedly before her body actually died, because they werent born with the sin of adam...."
81,My first thought exactly
82,"Depends on the gospel (there‚Äôs four). He could have ascended, or still roaming the earth, and there‚Äôs one where it doesn‚Äôt specify what happened iirc"
83,"According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus Christ was trying to make heaven on earth and coming back to life in your physical body was very important. Heaven was supposed to be on earth itself."
84,Had to come down eventually
85,"Someone probably looted the nails, at least that was the only thing of value on the cross."
86,"My 49-year-old sister still believes that Seaworld puts Orcas in plastic bags when they clean the pool, and refuses to accept that this was satire, even when it was pointed out on the actual onion page that it was satire. There's no way some religious leader is going to let some identifying graphic get in the way of a good confirmation bias."
87,Matzah eww
88,The irony of Jesus being celiac
89,I sought out my free award for you.  I'm gonna be thinking about this comment for a long time.
