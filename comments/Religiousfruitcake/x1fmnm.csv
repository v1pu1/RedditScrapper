2,They’re obviously secret agents
3,"This just made me realize... when a woman goes missing in these kinds of places, do they put up photos or physical descriptions of her?"

23,"What 100% literacy does to a MF >!Keralites love to brag about their higher literacy rate to the rest of the country, but the back side of their society looks like this!<"
24,"1: showing each person's results to the world is quite rude, so the anonymity isn't an issue for an advertisment.
2: this may just be the graduation uniform, which is fair enough and not fruitcake behaviour. You may have incorrectly equated this to a much larger problem, which it may not be, and so are being unnecessarily inflammatory."
25,if you call these women ninjas I will call your bikini wearing women identical sluts
26,Shhh don't leak trade secrets
27,It kinda looks like they did exactly that.
28,No joke there’s a book I read where a character puts a veil on to hide their identity.
29,No they just don't try to find them.
30,"Im would be surprised if they even look for a missing woman.

Like, i just read a story how lifeguards were stopped by the father of a drowning 20 year old woman because he rather let her die then unknown men ""touch"" her.

Edit: its literally the post under this one rofl"
31,How would she go missing if she’s either in her house or with a male relative?
32,"neither. 

she remains missing"
33,"They just kidnap another woman and replace the one that went missing. They all look the same, so nobody has any clue something happened. Eventually the first woman that went missing is kidnapped but because she was already replaced, nobody searches for her and the cycle closes."
34,"If a woman goes missing in these locales, we all know exactly what happened. So the probably won’t bother looking for her. And no one questions the religious folk for fear of being labelled."
35,"“Lost beach umbrella” return to owner please, call XXXXXXXXXX”"
36,The 4th one in the 6th row is hot ngl

39,"I mean you can still be gay and wear a Niqab, and do crime"
40,I have seen that happen in fiction.  The book was also set on the moon.
41,"Eyes visible, woman identifiable. Time for a fatwa."
42,Zainab’s hair looked like shit that day.
43,*I put on my ~~robe~~ abaya and ~~wizard hat~~ niqab*
44,"1 : you can't read their names because the photos are too blurry for it to be reasonably possible 

2 : A hijab counts as graduation uniform now?"
45,In what way is requiring a uniform of something covering all but a woman’s eyes defensible to you
46,"In India it is a custom to put the photos of merit holders or as we call them ‘toppers’ in advertisements. Everyone does it, even my school did it. It is considered prestigious if you are featured in the ‘topper list’"
47,"You know that the advantage of wearing what you want is, among other things, expressing your personal taste, so it's not the same as everyone else.

And for those who wear one-piece swimsuits, how would you say, then?"
48,Being a ninja is cool...
49,"You're aware that not all women in non-Muslim countries wear bikinis (and there's really nothing wrong with the ones that do)? You're also aware that being compared to a ninja is a cool thing, right?"
50,Oh look at that woman!  Look how it triggers you! Whaa whaa cry more.
51,"Lmao fucking idiot.
You're literally saying ""it's this girl's fault for dressing in a way that gives me an erection ! I couldn't help myself but rape her ! She is at fault here !""

I hope you don't/never have kids, human beings with your """"values"""" shouldn't be anywhere near society"
52,ooo someone's pissed.....
53,Found the Reddit incel!
54,Chill out anti Fortnite Jihadi
55,How do you honor Allah by playing Roblox and whining on the internet?
56,"Your Muhammad literally raped a child. So, I am not surprised by your mentality here."
57,That is not at all equivalent.  Ninjas are cool.
58,"Excuse me?  That woman is someone’s property, they are going to need to be remembered for the loss. /s"

64,Noor needed some coffee.
65,"Ok, maybe it was a dumb comment of mine."
66,Don’t like it don’t go to that school?
67,"It would be an issue if it was required for learning, but if it was just for graduation day I would say that it's fine for tradition's sake, though I don't know if it even is a grad uniform tbh. Otherwise it may be erasing culture."
68,personal taste isnt as much of a problem as being sexualized and catcalled isnt it
69,I said bikini because I MEAN bikini idiot
70,being sucking off every man in every corner isnt
71,"I mean, while this guy's misogyny is BS, I sorta felt the ninja comment. I was on a dating show years ago and we went to Disneyland (we both had annual passes). There was a woman probably 100 feet away or more dressed like the women above and dude *yelled* (loudly enough for everyone to turn and look at us) ""Look! A ninja!"" And then I couldn't even mention on the show that he'd done that because the producers said it was ""too offensive"". Like, no shit. I felt like it was so offensive, he deserved to be called out on TV but I can see how it might have put a damper on the otherwise cheerfully snarky Love Connection banter."
72,[removed]
73,I waiting for someone to bring up the username
74,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/dad-wont-let-drowning-daughter-be-saved-by-strange-rescuer-report/

Not fake"
75,"Missing, manhandled, murdered.....all the same to the local authorities."
76,Ey bby gurl pls show ankles
77,Yeah let's see their fathers recognize them from THAT poster. If he recognizes his daughter from THAT poster then he deserves to kill her /s
78,I masturbated to all of them
79,If I don’t like child marriage and rape simply shut up about it? Do you see how flawed that logic is. If nobody spoke up about injustices women still wouldn’t be able to vote. Don’t be stupid.
80,A lot of traditions and cultures are misogynistic and ridiculous. Circumcision for example for either sex.
81,"When ""culture"" and ""traditions"" coerce half the population to hide and be effectively serfs for life, least they face physical punishment and ostracisation, it is legitimate to criticise and fight it.

>Otherwise it may be erasing culture.

What? Culture erasing is forced assimilation by an ethnicity over another by forbidding any expression of common identity."
82,"And I also thought that the ninja comment was using it as a slur, which isn't acceptable."
83,How about teaching your men to be people instead of acting like base animals?
84,Veiled women are raped. This is a universal evil of men in every country. Do better
85,r/ArabPorn - go rub one out and chill
86,"Women dress how they want and if men have a problem with that, they just have to get treatment. If you can't hold back, you're not a man, you're an animal that gives in to its urges instead of reasoning and behaving in a civilized way."
87,You ever tried wearing bikini? Very comfortable!
88,"I guess you said stupid hoping to insult me? If you knew the etymology of the word idiot, you would know that I am proud to be an idiot. It comes from Latin and it literally means ""without dogma"", therefore able to think for oneself, without regurgitating the reasoning of others.
So thank you for that compliment."
89,"Good thing 99% of people don't do that in any country, then!"
90,is that what you do all day ?
91,You are one serious pervert.  You know this right?
92,Do you really think something like this is happening here?
93,So it’s women fault that men can’t behave?
94,"About 70% of the women who were raped in Egypt were veiled. Are you sure the problem is what women wear, and not horny men who can't even stand seeing some skin of a woman?

Your religion is barbaric, of a 7th-century pedophile. If men cannot control their urges, you blame it on women. Really shows your perspective.

Source: A study from the egyptian center of women's rights.

Some details of the study:

>These results disprove the belief that sexual harassment is linked to the way women dress (women are sexually harassed when dressed “indecently” or are not veiled – in the words of some participants), since 72.5% of victims surveyed were veiled.  
Results show that the vast majority - 62.4% of the male audience surveyed - confirmed that they have perpetrated and/or continue to perpetrate one or more of the forms of harassment.  
Regarding frequency of harassing behavior, the vast majority of male participants stated they harassed women approximately once a day, while others stated they did so more than once a day. The minority harassed weekly and then monthly.

95,"Isn't that a common occurrence in muslim countries? you know, raping woman, having them as slaves, murdering them for ""stepping out of line"". Even tho they're completely covered all the time, they suffer as much and worse than women in other countries. It doesn't really matter what women wear, be it a bikini or a burka, there's always abusive men ready to hurt them, specially in muslim countries."
96,"lol rapes are far more common in muslim countries, and when I see people in my country catcalling it is usually arab men,  since you raise your men to be swine that can do to women what they want"
97,So in Muslim countries women aren't raped? Right.
98,It's never a woman's fault if she's raped. It's men's faults and the people who raised them. Like your parents and you.
99,"It might not be fake, but its also a story without any credible evidence. So we cant know for sure if its fake or not. To he honest, i hope its fake.

edit: if the story is true, it, at the very least, is a very old story presented as if it happened yesterday. Which is pretty misleading"
100,i masturbated to the father too
