1,"Fuck whoever that is, fuck them with a nail studded dildo. If anything, cats are gods we should be worshiping."
2,Im just hopeless for people like thisðŸ’€
3,"Christians would burn literally everything on the stake, that seem satanic to them in their psychotic trance."
4,Man I was with them until the whole burning cats alive thing
5,"Mahogany? Seriously?!  I mean, one, thatâ€™s an endangered species and two, do you have *any* idea how much that would cost?  Bitch please!"
6,Can these violent criminally insane ah please be put on a watch list and be strictly controlled without access to children or any pets
7,Christianâ€™s are satanic. They all really like burning shit
8,"I'm sorry are they denying that God made cats now? Isn't burning animals supposed to be a satanic ritual? 

I mean, I guess I have someone to test my polearms on now."
9,If I catch one burning my cat I'll burn him with cheap pine wood.
10,"Mahogany? Damn, I've been using oak."
11,"Actually, in Ancient Egypt (Or Rome but I think Egypt. My history may be a bit off), cats were so sacred that killing one meant a literal death sentence, even if by accident. Plus idk about you but cats are the best companions IMO."
12,That would be a nail studded cross for Christian sexual stimulation. Dildos are in the shape of the devil. A cross would simply satisfy their persecution fetish.
13,All my homies cheer for Bastet.
14,"That was actually a small town in ancient Egypt where the law was enacted. It was because of a myth they believed which lead to Bastet being added to the pantheon.

That story was the one which made me fall in love with ancient Egypt. ;)"
