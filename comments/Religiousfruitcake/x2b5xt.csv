1,Satan is when rockets go *wooooooosh*
2,"Absolute dumbasses, but points for creativity. They should be consulted for the next Dan Brown novel."
3,"T-minus couldn't possibly mean ""Time-minus"" to launch, could it? They've solved the DA Vinci code! Praise gawd everyone! Hosanna!"

5,"anyone else notice that 'lived' is just 'devil' backwards?

that's right, everyone who's ever lived is the prince of hell himself. repent!"
6,"""Satan minus the 't'"".... so its SAAN then.  Don't tell him where SANTA comes from"
7,"NASA is just ASSASSINS minus the S, the S, the S, the I and the S.

That's why the rockets go ""sssis"" when they are going up."
8,If this makes you go hmm you're an oxygen thief.
9,Ah yes the world famous Aeronautical Company SAAN
10,Wait till they find out about the SATA drives in their computer . . .
11,And they wonder why people laugh at them always?
12,"Just adding in a t doesn‚Äôt turn NASA into Satan

It‚Äôs either NASAT or TASAN

It takes next level commitment when you not only add a letter, but need it to be an anagram 

Then again, these are the same people that believe in the ridiculous things in the Bible, so maybe that explains it"
13,Like Mama in the Waterboy - everything is the Devil
14,Further evidence is that Elton John sings rocket man and he is gay. Therefore rockets are gay and evil. It all adds up.
15,It's funny how in their minds a group of evil satanists is manipulating the world from the shadows in complete secrecy but they also leave little clues for people on Facebook to find just for funsies
16,"By their logic, it's also Santa."
17,"Ah, [apophenia](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Apophenia), [numerology](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Numerology), and [new gematria](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/New_gematria)‚Ä¶ always good for a laugh (at least until someone's reputation gets smashed‚Ä¶)"
18,guys.... if you say 'fart' but make the word 'fart' into 'satan' it spells S-A-T-A-N......
19,"These imbeciles seriously think that evil-doers, that don‚Äôt even exist, are outrageously childish and have fun with word games."
20,Yikes... Well it was super clever but you got your letters a little mixed up there bro.. It would be r minus not t minus. Lol
21,"Pretty sure that 'satan' without the 't' is 'saan', but I'm no expert, so correct me if I'm wrong."
22,wait til they rearrange the letters in SANTA
23,"No, silly! We meant Santa!"
24,This makes me want to facepalm myself into space
25,"Conspiracy theories are like ARGs for the dumbest of people, so all the puzzles have to be really obvious despite the fact that all the organizations mentioned in them have remained in hiding for hundreds of years and apparently murder anyone who is on to them"
26,It‚Äôs a bird‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a plane‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄôS SATAN
27,Saan
28,#NASAT
29,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ how fucking stupid!!
30,Where do you find this crazy ass shit? I would assume facebook?
31,I almost feel like this was created by someone to troll religious fruitcake types of people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs comical
32,This is some prime Poe's Law fuckery here.
33,RL is not the da Vinci code
34,"Isn't SATAN minus the ""t"" SAAN?"
35,Right. And Christian is shitcan without the r and the extra i.
36,"""god"" is ""dog"" backwards. It represents how he hides like a little bitch whenever the astronauts show up."
37,I once got the whole Santa is Satan speech from my religious fruitcake relative. Thing is that of you are using anagrams to mean something then it cuts both ways. Dog = God.
38,"Well there is the dumbest shit I‚Äôve read all day, and it‚Äôs still early. Damn."
39,There‚Äôs sus in Jesus
40,"[""Could it be SATAN?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_mePjkQW_c&ab_channel=pumacub77)"
41,That does not make any sense
42,I'd legit wear that t-shirt though
43,"If this is true, then Satan has far more advanced technology than god.

# And Nasa has never asked for my money."
44,Sans
45,I have such a hard time believing this is real but deep down I know my grandma would post this on Facebook.
46,why would they leave hints about being affiliated with satan
47,Did Dave spill the beans again?
48,"I always wonder when I see these type of posts.
Are satanic organizations going to make themselves easy to decipher and find?"
49,"Finally, SAAN"
50,‚ÄúNASA IS Satan!‚Äù Also ‚Äúwhat country are you from? Has your country been to the moon?!‚Äù Thanks NASA!
51,"This would have been a great church lady SNL skit.

Hell, bring back Dana Carvey as a host and do it now."
52,"NASA is just Satan, minus the T.

Test of comment.

Satan - T = Saan

Saan != NASA

Nope, doesn't work."
53,"Omg and Christian is just Satan with an extra h, r, c, and a couple i's. Dont be Christian its just Satan fooling you!"
54,"See NASA, you think just because you have a bunch of rocket scientists you can slip that one past them.   They may not have a bunch of rocket scientists or any scientists on team fruitcake but they have Q on their keyboard and they know how to use it."
55,I really want that NASA/SATAN Mashup logo they made for us on a hat. Shit slaps
56,Why not go into space? I thought they want to be closer to god. Seems like a logical step.
57,If you change around and completely replace all the letters in the word god you also can spell out Satan.
58,"I thought they thought ""Nasa"" was Jewish for ""deceiving""?"
59,Why do these people try to find hidden ‚Äúmessages‚Äù everywhere? Is this some sort of delusion? Like a constant fear of persecution causing them to always be looking for signs?
60,Are these people actually stupid enough to think that one of the most well funded organizations in the world would name themselves in a cartoony villain way for a small child protagonist to figure out?
61,Lmao t stands for time ‚è≤Ô∏è
62,SAAN
63,This made me chuckle
64,Could you imagine how much cooler and more interesting the world would be if there were secrets behind everything and the only way to learn the secrets is by solving anagrams.
65,Can't sneak any absurdities past the christians.
66,Unassailable logic
67,"Saan. Nasat. What? Hehe this can‚Äôt be real.

Dog spelt backwards is god! God is a dog!"
68,"You know what, this one doesn't even piss me off, this is brilliant üòÇ"
69,I am a saanist
70,"It just really bakes my brain to think anyone would see this and be like, ""oh my gosh Frank, it all makes sense now""."
71,That‚Äôs fucking hilarious
72,"First time I watched interstellar, I was like, how could the government let society, the environment, and infrastructure collapse while at the same time denying history and spaceflight? But these days I totally get it"
73,You must be making a whole lot of assumptions. That's god damn heaps of assumptions.
74,"This is legit what my dad believes as a fundamentalist Christian. He fully believes that NASA is the public face of a conspiracy to hide the flat earth truth from Christians and cause people to sin against God.

Did I try to explain the basic astronomy that proves the earth is spherical? Yes

Did I find out that fundamentalists are impossible to reason with? Also yes.

At this point I just encourage him to change the doctrine of the Church of Christ to include flat earth, the Book of Enoch, and nephilim/ Bigfoots that he hunts for. It's easier that way."
75,hmm...ü§îü§îü§î
76,SHIT is just CHRIST without the C and R. Why do you think CONSTIPATION starts with a C and RIM JOB starts with an R?
77,"Christians are always Jeff Goldblum-ing the fuck out of everything.  Mental gymnastics.

""Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code!"""
78,SAAN
79,Dog is god in reverse
80,All fear the government agency known as SAAN.
81,"Actually it means ‚ÄúTarzan‚Äù.  They get the ‚ÄúR‚Äù from ‚ÄúfouR‚Äù, Four being the number of characters in ‚ÄúNASA‚Äù, the ‚ÄúS‚Äù is actually a backward ‚ÄúZ‚Äù with soft curves."
82,"It makes me go ""hmmm"" alright, but not for the reason they think"
83,Saan
84,Gotta be ironic.
85,#HAIL SATAN
86,Why? Why NASA???!!!
87,"Things that make you go ""What bullshit..."""
88,SAAN
89,Man that‚Äôs a lot of steps.
90,Stupidity level :- immeasurable
91,"Like jf i were a hidden cult organization, why would i make cryptic messages?"
92,"Well, you see ""Nasa"" means ""Devil"". Just remove N A S and add letters D E V I L! They thought they can hide from pure kristian!"
93,Santa
94,Of course their imaginary friend has an imaginary enemy.
95,So does satan appear and light the candle or something
96,Love that
97,"Dog is GOD in the opposite direction, which means dogs are evil. so we should kill/drive away dogs, as they bring malicious intent with their dumb smiles.

(No, I am not killing my dog whose laying beside me.)"
