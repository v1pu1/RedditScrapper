1,"its absolutely bullshit lmao . the order of, um...""discharges"" has no bearing on what DNA is contained and transferred from both parents. forgive me, geneticist reddit, for dumbing this down, but 23 chromosomes come from one parent and 23 from the other. That's what determines your physical traits and genes, not the timing of ejaculation, lol. My source is that i COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY..lmao are they fr"
2,"Did you mean: ""Islam is *millennia behind* of any scientific knowledge""?"
3,Read the chapter on genetics in any high school bio textbook and you'll have your answer
4,"Its absolutely obvious rubbish. Makes completely no sense. Female discharge doesnt contain the mothers dna for making a child. The eggs do. This clearly shows their ancient beliefs, like they didnt even know what sperm and eggs are."
5,It‚Äôs obviously nonsense.
6,"‚ÄúIf a chicken marries a donkey on a full moon then the Ford Mustang will bear no resemblance to monkey nor Krispy Kreme ‚Äù

- Me. 1234.

Light years ahead of any scientific knowledge."
7,"let‚Äôs say the woman came 3 times, does that mean triplets?"
8,What the fuck is gets discharge?
9,This is one of thr dumbest things I have seen
10,Basically this bullshit is from some guy who can't please a woman trying to justify why they abuse the hell out of their wife.
11,That's total bullshit.
12,I haven't got any scientific background but I can tell you 100% that that's bullshit
13,Sounds like an excuse for not bothering to make your wife come.
14,"It's bullshit. I always ""discharge"" first, my wife never does and our kids resemble neither of us (but they do resemble our postman, for reasons unknown)"
15,There‚Äôs no scientific facts in the Quran or Hadith. It is all just twisting words.
16,"Islam would be science if they had added:


> we tested it, it's true, here's the results if you want to review them


But they don't understand the difference between faith and the scientific method...


(BTW: no need to test this, it's pure BS...)"
17,[deleted]
18,"Yeah, all my kids look like my wife because I am such a good lover‚Ä¶"
19,There would be like 7 women born a year
20,Sounds like The Prophet (TM) had a squirting fetish...
21,Absolute garbage. The genetic combination and ergo sex determination happens when the sperm and egg combine their 23 chromosomes and is not affected by anything external to it like this ridiculous assertion.
22,Lol do fake orgasams count?
23,"Yeah no.

Which parent the child ""resembles"" more is essentially random."
24,If anything it just seems to be a convenient excuse for cumming too soon. *I only wanted boys*
25,">Can anyone with any scientific background clarify if this is correct or just rubbish?

Scientific background? You need high school level Anatomy Physiology to know this is rubbish.

Which person gets off first isn't relevant to the genetic material that reaches the ovum. That's a matter of which sperm carrying which material reaches the egg first. Some carry an X some carry a Y. The exact amount is not even, so really it's entirely up to which were produced by the man in higher quantity that increases the odds of having a boy or a girl.

Either way, it's up to a life or death competition that's part swim meet part egg hunt between 20 to 150 million competitors per milliliter that determines boy or girl."
26,"Female discharges have literally nothing whatsoever to do with the sex of the fetus. Male semen determines the sex of the fetus because it is 22 body chromosomes and 1 sex chromosome that is either X or Y

Female ovum is always X

If an X carrying semen penetrates the ovum and make a zygot with it, the fetus is a female

If it's a Y carrying semen then it's a male"
27,There is no scientific background needed to tell that this is rubbish
28,Honestly there‚Äôd be so many more dudes around‚Ä¶.
29,Lol okay Islam.
30,You can save 100% on Islamic 'science knowledge' by treating all of it as nonsense. I mean they still won't eat pork despite mountains of science showing there's nothing wrong with it if cooked properly and pigs in their natural environment are actually extremely clean animals. Turns out only when you keep them in a 6x6 pen they lie in their own shit.
31,Wtf this is Bs
32,"Does having been to school count as scientific knowledge because this is clearly bullshit, that's not how anything works."
33,"this is complete bullshit. when meiosis occurs, traits are assigned from the genes present at random (of course save for the recessive and dominant effects). how else would we have genetic diversity! this‚Ä¶ theory?‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt understand how information is exchanged in the process of conception. the egg has some basic information, the sperm has some basic information. this information is brought out during conception, and depending on the traits present in the information shared‚Ä¶ those traits will be assigned. (the reason it‚Äôs random is due to how small eggs and individual sperms are."
34,"An old wives tale (especially in south Asian cultures) usually passed around when family members are guessing the baby‚Äôs sex, no nothing scientific about it"
35,It's bullshit of the highest degree.
36,"I'm an engineer not a scientist, but no. It's decided by the chromosome in the sperm and that is mostly randomized. Though some genetic dispositions can change the ratio or their viability, nothing about the timing, sex position, or who orgasms first decides that.

XX is female, XY is male, so the woman can only contribute an X, if the sperm has an X or Y chromosome from the father determines the sex."
37,"It‚Äôs absolute nonsense. Who finishes first in no way contributes to how a baby will look. That‚Äôs not how genetics works. But don‚Äôt take my word for it. Consider that if that was a factor in how a baby develops then all cases of artificial insemination would produce babies that look exactly like the father, since the woman obviously would not have an orgasm at all in that case."
38,bullshit.
39,"Islam is so far behind all scientific knowlage along with most if not all religions, particularly the fundi versions."
40,"If a woman discharges first during sex . . . she shouldn‚Äôt be having sex at all! Get to a gynecologist, woman, you could be making yourself AND your man very sick!"
41,"Rubbish. 
Source: I study genetics and epidemiology in a medical school."
42,Lol. Pure superstitious üí© flavored fruitcake. If their was a actual way to control what a child looking in such a manner it would have been common human knowledge long before the Muslim or other religion came into existence. But they sure would have taken a the credit for it.
43,"Pregnancy has so many pseudo scientific stuff surrounding it, its an unparralleled Clown Fiesta.

All ""mertods"" to determine a Childs gender or what it will look like are bullshit. The only realiable thing is the Doctor examining the child and genetics dont let anyone fool you with garbage like this."
44,Light years are a unit of distance not time so they‚Äôre already a bit behind right there
45,I can confirm that magic is not real.
46,Definitely rubbish. Orgasms during intercourse take place \*long\* before the sperm reaches the egg. It's even normal for intercourse to happen even before ovulation.
47,You don't need a scientific background to know this is stupid beyond belief.
48,Interesting that they used the term lightyear after their infamous reaction to the Pixar movie of the same name
49,"it‚Äôs Aristotelian biology, esp if ‚Äúfirst‚Äù is meant to imply ‚Äúgreater‚Äù or primary discharge instead of just chronological order. For example, Aristotle thought that when a child resembled the mother more than the father, the cause was that the mother‚Äôs discharge was more potent than the father‚Äôs.

Saying this to point out that the original source of the quote is probably not an idiot but a medieval Muslim thinker who was reacting to the science of his time. On the other hand, the person who made this meme‚Ä¶."
50,You aren't actually asking if this dumbass meme is scientifically accurate right?  I mean this is stuff that we've understood for centuries as being false.
51,"It's sad, the arab people used to be one of the most scientifically advanced cultures on the planet.

And then along came a pedo-lunitic-warcriminal and they have been stagnant/backwards every since."
52,..... You need a scientist to tell that this is bullshit? ü§®
53,Worries me that op needs the confirmation
54,"""Gets discharge"" is a really weird way to put it... also completely incorrect, there's no way or reason that would have anything to do with it. How can you prove that who ""gets discharge"" (ew) first matters beyond just asking people what happened? Should be easy for scientists to look into it but as one myself I highly doubt it"
55,"A load of rubbish (in your words)  
There is a psychological phenomenon taking place called the ""Parents Trait Anxiety"" where males are apt to see physical similarities even when very few are present.  Add that to the fact that men more often than not ""discharge first"" you have a perfect recipie for non-causual correlation (where one part of the correlation is subjective).  


A sample paper discussing the anxiety  


[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855035/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855035/)"
56,"![gif](giphy|30xtloCL4Lr0I)

This breaks the bullsh\*t meter!"
57,"Technically, this would  most likely be accurate, since the child will more often than not resemble both. So... yeah?"
58,By discharge do they mean orgasm
59,"Discharge as in ejaculation? Anyway, looks depends upon genes. We inherit a set of genes from our parents(2 sets in total) the chance of that gene expresses it self is 50%(not taking dominance/ressevive or pleiotropy or co-dominance in equation) 




Ps: sorry for any grammatical errors."
60,I can say that whenever I used 'discharge' in medschool it meant something is coming out that shouldn't....
61,Fun fact I have 4 daughters and a random old man stopped me in Nebraska furniture mart to tell me if I make my husband cum first we will have a boy. I‚Äôm front of my kids. Oldest aged 11 so she was like tf. So. The more you know.
62,I wish there was a laughing response
63,"well, I guess you already know that scientifically it is just bullshit

but it is an authentic Hadith, which shows how ignorant Islam is"
64,r/badwomensanatomy lmao
65,"It seems like Islamists looked over at the US, saw the fundamentalists/evangelicals were out-crazying them by a huge margin, and realized they needed to step their game up"
66,"The clue is in the word ""Islam"". It's gibberish."
67,All organized religion is bullshit.
68,"Why are there still people on the planet that haven't worked out religion is nonsense and most of what comes out of it is nonsense.

Some nice art, but that's about your lot."
69,"It's bullshit.

Source: im not a moron, paid attention in school and am now studying biology."
70,I think at that time bick and v@gin@ can talk so they tell that who the fuck that discharged first and ruined the sex
71,I am 99.999999999999999% sure this is BS
72,Obvious rubbish.
73,"Bullshit.  Absolute bullshit.  How you look is based on environment & genes, not who cums first."
74,"RUBBISH.  Pure, unadulterated RUBBISH.

DNA recombination is not even infinitesimally affected by which parent got to the finish line first.

I'm thinking this is just fathers adding to bragging about a child looking like them.

And they forgot: Mama's baby, Daddy's maybe."
75,"OK there it is, the dumbest thing I‚Äôm going to read all day. And I haven‚Äôt even started reading about Trump stealing the United States nuclear secrets yet."
76,"I have no specific scientific knowledge other than a basic understanding of biology, and I can tell you this is rubbish."
77,Isn‚Äôt that nice of Mo the pedo to excuse pre-mature ejaculation poor guys think its a virtue to be a two pump chump.
78,"Who cums first has literally nothing to do with a child's appearance. 

This just sounds like dudes who are very bad at sex trying to justify their inability to pleasure their partner."
79,"The ""prophet"" said lot of dumb shit. There is no reason to take any of it seriously."
80,"As a nurse, of course this is bullshit"
81,It‚Äôs absolute rubbish. The kids features were determined at the moment of conception because that‚Äôs when paternal DNA mixes with maternal.
82,"So any man who believes that, can't make their female partner orgasm OR they can't last long. Good to know."
83,"For what it's worth, I'm a physicist and I declare this to be bullshit."
84,"Gonna go out on a limb here and say ‚Äúrubbish‚Äù.

The last time Islam was ahead of science was ‚Äúnever‚Äù.

They‚Äôre no better than the Xtians frankly."
85,"As everyone else is saying, total rubbish.

However, this **is** a piece of evidence that the Qur'an is a product of its time. It was a very common belief in the ancient near east that both men *and* women had to orgasm in order to achieve conception. This has no doubt informed attitudes in the Bible and Qur'an towards rape, since if the woman gets pregnant, she 'had to enjoy it'. If the Qur'an was inspired, they would have known otherwise.

Here's a nice paper about it in ancient Judaism: https://brill.com/view/journals/dsd/28/1/article-p38_3.xml?language=en

And another focusing on Babylon and Greece: https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789047414315/BP000016.xml?language=en

And an article for medieval Europe, and how that has filtered down to US legislators: https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2012/aug/20/legitimate-rape-medieval-medical-concept"
86,"""What? No, what? No...""

My reaction to this. Why would this be true? I can understand the whole short dicks = more girls hypothesis better than this. 

If someone can give me a reason why this would be true, scientifically from one biologist to another, I would love to hear it."
87,There is literally no difference.
88,The Quran cares about female orgasm? I assume thats what a discharge means?
89,"Well all my kids look like me so I'd say it's correct.

/s guess this wasn‚Äôt obvious."
90,Seems legit
91,They won‚Äôt even WATCH ‚ÄúLightyear‚Äù cause of that 1/2 second kiss in the beginning! Dang lesbians‚Ä¶.
92,Usually a woman has discharge (aka being wet) before she has an orgasm... Obviously not if you force her üíÄ
93,"My kids were in vitro, so who should they look like?"
94,100% rubbish. That is not how genetics and biology work. Not at all.
95,"Yeah, my hs bio says that that's completely wrong"
96,"What if they both do it together? Like, you know sometimes both, the guy and the girl ""discharge"" almost the same time. Does m. seconds come into play here ?"
97,I discharged first and my kid looks just like my wife
98,What do they mean by discharging in this context
99,Is ‚Äùdischarge‚Äù Quran for cum?
100,Light years
