1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,That has got to be the best idea I've ever heard of. If they all did that we could move on from religion and be better
2,It just goes to show how much of a mind poison religious faith is. That pastor clearly believed he would rise from the grave and the only thing that convinced him of that was faith.
3,"Keep burying them until one of them rises! Surely, it won't take too long?"
4,Not even the first time this has happened lol
5,"Not the chosen one apparently.

RIP."
6,Godamn what a horrible way to go. I wonder if right towards the end he questioned his life choices.
7,The fact that they can’t see it for a death cult is… strange.
8,"This is as dumb as those snake handler preachers who think they can handle deadly snakes and won't be harmed...because Jeebus. 

Apparently the preacher who got people to bury him had tried the stunt before and survived. This time his parlour trick didn't work. He left behind a pregnant wife. Because he was an idiot who preyed on the ignorance and gullibility of others. Like jesus."
9,Pastor's last big brain moment!
10,"But Jeshua of Nazareth was *already* dead when he was put in the cave.

That is, according to Bible. Some theories suggest that he barely survived (he was on the cross for only three days, your usual crucified convict would be on for months, sometimes even years, long after only skeleton remained). While difficult and excruciating, it's not impossible."
11,Mysterious ways….
12,If he was planning to come back from the dead shouldn't he die first rather than bury himself alive?
13,Sometimes the trash takes itself out
14,why is african christianity so weird
15,He was trying to beat Mr Beast’s record
16,Jesus didn't help him breathe 6 feet under.
17,a double W for humanity
18,We should subtly encourage this trend amongst the evangelicals.
19,Least lunatic African pastor
20,"Well, he met his favorite person"
21,Forgive me while I Ahahahahahahahahahahaha
22,"I am impressed that the pastor actually believed in his own shit.

I think it is 50/50 if religious leaders actually believe and follow their own teachings"
23,Really awful way to go too.
24,Witch trials 2: Revival Boogaloo.
25,I wish more of them would volunteer.
26,You would think they would start to get a hint. It didn’t work for any of the others why are you any different?
27,I guess if the really believed it he might have stayed calm until he started to convulse from low oxygen and CO2 poisoning. Or he might pass out fairly peacefully.
28,Colonialism fucked Africa really hard.
29,Thanks
30,"My friend worked in Nigeria. He told like even doctorate students are extremely religious and believe all these non sense.

The American Christian cult is dumping shit ton of money to keep poor nations gullible and forever anti intellectual."
31,"This gives me an idea: Christian Trials!

You don't even float? Jesus walked on water. You must not be a Chistian.

You died and didn't come back? Your faith was weak. 

Here's a few fish and some bread. That should last you plenty of time; just make more!"
32,Man I hope so.
