1,.22LR 1911 LMFAO
2,Didnâ€™t Jesus say something about turning the other cheek
3,"Unfortunately, the religious person commited murder without explicit permission from the church, and thus will be sent to hell"
4,"Meanwhile,  biblical Jesus would have told you to stand down and let them steal all your shit, and offer them the keys to your bank safe."

6,"""amen I say to you, shoot the bastards who enter your house without permission""

Book of Jebus, 20:16"
7,Amen
8,"I know, right? Is the home being invaded by squirrels?

Who tf buys a gun like that?  An insecure dude that wants to look like Billy Badass at the range, one handed shooting it?

I'm dying ðŸ˜… The joker that made this just googled ""Colt semi"" or such, and grabbed an image without looking at it."
9,"And if someone takes your shirt, give him your cloak.

Pretty sure it also translates to if someone takes your TV give them your playstation. Of someone tales you gold rings, give them your necklaces and contents of your safe."
10,"That sounds like some no-good commie bs to me. Jesus was obviously a gun-lovin' wealth-hoardin' 'murican patriot, who was only crucified 'cause those damn European Romans didn't believe in the 2nd amendment. Otherwise what's the point of being a Christian? /s"
11,"Donâ€™t worry, he goes to a MAGA church! Theyâ€™ve got approval to shoot."
12,Would a .22 even have the recoil to cycle a 1911? Considering you can fuck up a 9mm's feeding by limp wristing. I know it's decent in boltguns and revolvers but as far as I know semis don't really like it too much.
13,But I do agree with the basic premise of the meme at least. I want a MAC-10 for when Bubba down the lane inevitably decides the south is gonna rise again
14,Looked this one up. https://waltherarms.com/colt-1911-a1-2/
