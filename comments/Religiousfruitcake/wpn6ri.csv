1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"I don't know if the event itself is fruitcakey, but this letter seems nice enough, can't see any fruitcakery tbh

edit: I just realized it's jehovas witnesses, so chances are ""pursue peace"" is fruitcakey"
2,"Like, up until I saw JW, it wasn't a bad pitch. But jehovas witnesses are a cult, so"
3,"""persue peace"" because religion is *so* peaceful... Nope"
4,Fuck you Kevin
5,"Want to promote peace?

You can start by getting rid of religion."
6,I've been getting a bunch of these. I have half a mind to write them back but I also don't want to draw attention to myself or home when it's probably not going to get anywhere anyway.
7,"It's written by hand because jehowa witnesses are told to monthly report how many hours they spent preaching others and printing is much faster. By writing those letters someone is probably avoiding knocking to doors and talking to strangers. Good for him!
Edit: spelling"
8,"I got one of these- it had different writing. It basically was saying that same old line ""you will never be complete without god"". They had a number on there so my girlfriend and I signed it up for a ton of spam messages and calls"
9,Seems polite enough. I mean how much nicer could they have been? They have to recruit one way or another. I'd rather have this than some jerk at my door at 8 am. Just throw it away and move on. They aren't forcing you to watch.
10,"Things are not getting worse with those things, the old things are still around. Like Religion, which need to be destroyed so we can do something about War, violence, hatred and Racism."
11,"hahaha. I have gotten TWO of these letters in my life, when changing addresses. 

The Seventh Day Adventists do this too, but they will typically spend a few dimes to send a hallmark card with the hand written message inside. 

Need to up your game JW's, the Adventists are stealing your thunder and trying to knock you off the most batshit crazy pedestal."
12,"Holy shit.  He's the first guy to ever have the balls to actually sign one of these.

 The question is: Does that mark social progress like he's a Christian who won't hide behind anonymity to harass you but is willing to take responsibility for what he says & to whom, or does it just indicate that those who perpetrate Christian harassment are getting bolder?"
13,It beats having them come to your door when you've just gotten out of the shower...
14,The name suits the message
15,"Is it illegal to put a plaque, or a sign, saying

""FUCK YOU KEVIN.
You know which."""
16,"I've gotten these before - always pretty much the same words, different handwriting, and I'm 100% sure it didn't come from any of my actual neighbours.

The contrivance of it always amuses me, and leaves me to wonder if it ever succeeds."
17,"The world is more peaceful now than it has been through history. As an example, in the UK we had a brief outbreak of violence known as the hundred year war. Sure there is conflict today, but not at the death tolls or duration seen in previous centuries.

Of course this can be impoved on, but it is a fallacy to say the world is getting worse from a peace perspective."
18,kindling
19,"Oh it is. One of the talks a member of the Governing body calls a baby a ""little enemy of Jehovah""

As well as a video about a girl having to explain her homophobic beliefs to her teacher"
20,Fuck kevin
21,KeveÅ„
22,You could send it without a return address if it makes you feel better to send one.
23,Practicing their cursive as well.  ðŸ˜„
24,Why do they have to recruit? Itâ€™s entirely possible to not try to push your weird beliefs onto other people in their own private space.
25,"I've never had doorknocking JWs try to recruit me. They just want to talk about sin and point at bible verses, but I've never been invited to their church."
26,He even gave me his last name and a address to contact him (I cut that out so I donâ€™t get into trouble)
27,"No it isn't..less frequent small conflicts maybe, 
max 3mill died in hundred years war. WW2 118mill. People still die today from unexploded ordinance from the that war."
28,"I guess babies are the ""enemy"" because they're all atheists until the brainwashing starts."
29,Now you made it sexual
30,KÃ©vÃ¨Å„
31,I think they do it if you see them more than once.
32,"I get these every fucking week, replete with names and phone numbers."
33,Iâ€™ve never ever had one of these.
34,Now you said that you just jinxed yourself lol
