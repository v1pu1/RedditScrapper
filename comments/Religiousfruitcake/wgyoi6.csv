1,So much faster than light and I could tell
2,And lack of sleep had nothing g to do with the hallucination?
3,"IMO, the majority of posts like that are just someone blatantly lying and hoping that others will see them as more godly. Basically it's ""I'm closer to god than you are."" It's virtually guaranteed that another liar will try to one-up them."
4,"These guys are so oblivious. ""I purposely didn't sleep or eat for days to induce hallucinations and had a hallucination. Must be magic!"""
5,"Hmmm. Blue-white light.

Is he sure that was an angel?

6,What I believe to be 2 am? That explains it. Angel was heading home after partying at the bar all night.
7,Go to bed.  You need sleep asshole.
8,Hallucinations from lack of sleep are real
9,"Yeah, well, when I was five years old, I thought I saw the red light of Rudolphâ€™s nose on the wall opposite my bedroom window on Christmas Eve. (Most likely it was the cops bringing our drunken neighbor home)."
10,"ðŸ¤¨ Light travels so fast that you wouldn't be able to see it if it was passing across your eyes. Baseball players have less than 2 seconds to react to a 100 mph fastball before it's literally moving too fast for the optic nerve to send the signal to the brain and back. It's essentially ""invisible"" while they're swinging the bat."
11,My dreams when super tired are so much better than this
12,"That, or just simple sleep deprivation"
13,"Agreed. God hates liars, but they lie about things to appear more godly to other people. The thing they seem to blatantly and maybe even deliberately disregard is that extraordinary claims need proof to back it up."
14,"SMH, bragging about some flash of light, bitch should get on my level, i regularly see shadowy entities during sleep paralysis, clear as day.

But since i'm not bugfuck crazy i know that they're just images imagined up during a half-dreaming state."
15,"You know in The Sims 3, the way you die indicates the colour of your ghost?

&#x200B;

He saw Louis Slotin."
16,It says lightning not light
17,"I wouldn't discount it, or genuine mental illness, but there are so many similar style posts on religious social media that it really does seem like a competition. ""Thou shalt not bear false witness..."" certainly doesn't seem to discourage most Christians from lying their asses off."
18,With a little imagination you could turn your shadowy entities into karma on religious forums.
19,"Yes it does. Shit, lightning is plasma. ðŸ¤¦"
20,"I'd rather continue trying to seduce them. There's only two ways this ends, with me getting that gussy, or with me becoming the first person in history on the interdimensional sex offenders list."
