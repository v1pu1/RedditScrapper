1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Duty to him huh? What about the husbands duty to his wife? If I feel like using my strapon on him then it's his duty to give me his ass whenever I want too. Sex is not a reward!!! It's the promise and duty!!!
2,"I mean, they're right - sex *isn't* a reward for your husband.  It ain't a fuckin' duty either, though.  It should be something that all parties partake of freely and enthusiastically, and never used as a reward *or* a punishment.  Always great when they accidentally hit on part of the point."
3,"Religious people have got to be the most entitled folks ever. Sorry dude, just because you marry a woman doesn't mean you're entitled to sex whenever you want. And it certainly isn't her ""duty"". Bunch of idiots"
4,"Makes it sound like some kind of military marching training, and about as enjoyable."
5,I somewhat agree that sex shouldn't be a reward but non of that other shit makes any sense.
6,No it isn't.
7,Yup disgusting.
8,"Some dudes would be totally down with that.

But just like this lady needs to, they should realize that that is their preference for their sex life and not something they should try to tell every guy to do.

If she wants to be a sex doll who offers it up for her husband any time he wants even if he just pissed her off, that's her choice. But people like this always seem to think their way should be everyone's way."
9,"During wedding vows, there's nothing in the ""sickeness and in health"" part that says anything about sex. I'm not sure where these fruitcakes come from."
10,"Yeah I'm sure some dudes would be into that. Preferences and all that are okay, as long they are not harmful(obviously) and with their own consent. They don't ""have a duty"" to have sex. They do it because they want to not because ""they have"" to."
11,They get it from the bible. 1 Corinthians.
12,"Yeah whatever fantasy is cool.

I mean free use is one of them. Which I've actually been with a woman who was into it and it was fun. But just like any kink you have to have an underlying understanding that it's always consensual and if they say stop you always stop and never guilt them for it or hold it against them in any way. Otherwise it quickly goes from a kink to actually manipulative."
13,"Absolutely! Kinks can be fun, as long both partners are being honest about what they want and what not, they can have a wonderful experience. Respect, proper communication, safety and consent are the crucial parts for successful relationships."
