1,"“All religions are made up except mine…” Said every religious freak ever. Well why yours? You just think that because you were brainwashed into thinking that. If you were born somewhere else, you’d think another religion was the right one and all others were fake. It all comes down to geography if you think about it."
2,From all religions Islam is the most man made one.

4,"Logic you say?

Surah 86  5-7

Let people then consider what they were created from! ˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.


So the Quran thinks that sperm comes from between the rib cage and backbone.

You only need one example to prove that this is man-made. The creator of the universe wouldn’t make such a silly mistake."
5,"> you can challenge the reasons muslims believe Islam is true once you do that you will find you cannot refute it.

And you also can't refute the existence of [Russell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot), because belief in an entity immune to observation is airtight and ""not refutable"".

That's why the burden isn't on the nonbeliever to refute *every* unobservable, abstract supernatural entity, the burden of proof rests on anyone who posits something *beyond what can be physically observed* exists out in the ether somewhere."

7,"As Islam is an abrahamic religion, shouldn’t it also recognize the religion practiced by father Abraham?  How is this explained to the followers?"
8,"It's the third religion in the trilogy that's the True Religion.  The god of the region needed a few goes to get it right, apparently."
9,"I’m just going to address the point about proving a negative and say logic dictates that you absolutely can. The claim that “you **can’t** prove a negative” or “a negative **can’t** be proven” is itself a negative. That means if this statement is true, it disproved what it’s proporting. If you can prove that statement is true, you’ve just proven a negative, which means the statement is not true. It’s a direct logical contradiction.  

 Let’s just prove a negative to show it can be done though. Here’s a negative claim:

>My car is **not** in my backpack

>P1: Only objects less than 30 liters of volume can fit in my backpack  
>P2: My car is more than 3000 liters of volume 
Conclusion: My car is **not** in my backpack 

This is a deductively valid syllogism with a conclusion that is a negative, demonstrating that proving a negative can be done fairly easily."
10,What sub was that?

12,He just committed blasphemy in Islam. Lmao
13,Islamist fanatics are the worst 🤮
14,Islam is literally the 10th oldest religion ever known.
15,Or the religion your parents indoctrinated you into
16,"Nah man, the list is easily:

1. Scientology

2. Mormonism

3. Islam

All the other big ones have at least a millennium or so of history where the paper trail disappears into ""early human civilization""."
17,"Nah.  Scientology.  The dude straight up said:

""The way to make a million dollars is to start a religion.""

&#x200B;

The idea's not new either, the founder of the Mormon church, Joeseph Smith was a vagrant, a con-man, an imposter and a charlatan, then he made up some of the craziest nonsense I've ever come across."
18,"It is a shorthand for a useful idea that is easy to say, relatively easy to understand what is meant, and helps prevent tedious and fruitless arguments, particularly arguments with moving goalposts.

People generally agree that (conclusive) evidence of something means it exists.

Lack of evidence (for or against) doesn't mean something doesn't exist. You have no indication either way. It may not exist, it may be rare, it may by plentiful elsewhere but not here, etc. Therefore, without evidence (for or against) you can't ""prove"" something doesn't exist. Or, in shorthand, you can't prove a negative. It means without any evidence, for or against.

Once you have conclusive evidence (for or against), you can prove things.

In mathematics, evidence of (not X) can be proof of X. Cool, but that is still evidence (against, in this case). However, science isn't a set of axioms and laws of the universe, just an approximation of them. A new discovery could alter our approximations and allow something we previously thought impossible.

Even in science (not X) may prove some X but this only works in those cases where we agree on the rules. This is the part about moving goalposts.

For example, if I'm insisting there is a giant moon larger than the diameter of the sun yet circling the Earth, you might show me why, mathematically or with our theory of physics, that doesn't make sense. I might then argue it circles the Earth in another dimension, without any gravitational influence, etc. I keep adding far-fetched but not provably impossible concepts until you can't debate me further or you strangle me in frustration.

Better to say that you can't prove the absence of evidence of X existing is not proof that X doesn't exist and that the onus is on the person making the claim X exists to provide evidence."""
19,"What?

Islam began in the year 610CE

There have been literally hundreds of  religions prior to Islam.

Here are a few examples (by no means exclusive)  There have been thousands of cultures and a fair amount of research into belief systems, codified and not.

&#x200B;

Indigenous Australian -Dreamtime (40,000 years or so, maybe)

Ancient Britons/Celts - Druidic

Norse

Germanic religions

Ancient Egyptian - Ra, etc.

Ancient Minoans and Greek religions

Ancient Roman religions

Vedic religions - to Hindu.

Sumerian religion

Olmec religion

Parshvanatha - Jainism

Zoroastrianism

Buddhism

Confucianism

Judaism

Christianity

Islam"
20,"Not counting all the celtic pagan religions that get lumped into 1 group. Not counting all the Polynesian pantheon, not counting all the hindu religions, all the oriental religions. But yeah the religion invented in 800 AD is the 10th oldest, for sure."
21,Which is most likely the main religion of that region/country.
22,Islam was the first. Scientology isn't religion. Mormonism is something I am not familiar with. But pervert's schizophrenic hallucinations were first.

24,"It may be something that is easy to say but it isn’t true. I think that’s the main problem, it’s something that’s become too easy to say and people say it without really giving it any thought.

>	People generally agree that (conclusive) evidence of something means it exists.

I agree, but I’m not even talking about evidence, I’m talking logical proof. And it doesn’t get more conclusive than a logically valid argument.

>	Lack of evidence (for or against) doesn’t mean something doesn’t exist.

I agree but I didn’t give an example of a lack of evidence, I gave an example that proves it’s impossible for a car to exist in my backpack. Proving it’s impossible for (X) to be the case is logically just as good of an argument as proving (Y) necessarily must be the case. 

>	Therefore, without evidence (for or against) you can’t “prove” something doesn’t exist. Or, in shorthand, you can’t prove a negative. 

You don’t even actually need evidence to prove things. A logically valid deductive argument proves things, that’s what it does by definition. A logically valid argument can also be made with no evidence, and it isn’t even necessarily going to be true in reality. That’s a logically **sound** argument that requires evidence. But the proof is actually just the logic. Additionally, the shorthand is incorrect that’s the problem and I demonstrated how. It is the case that you **can** prove a negative, and the statement itself is a negative, so why say a thing that is just not true? 

>	In mathematics, evidence of (not X) can be proof of X. Cool, but that is still evidence (against, in this case). However, science isn’t a set of axioms and laws of the universe, just an approximation of them. A new discovery could alter our approximations and allow something we previously thought impossible.

Well I’m not talking about science about logic, which you could argue mathematics is part of, but logic is essentially based on just a set axioms. The laws of logic, and there’s not really much getting around those. They’re the case whether we like them or not unfortunately, but the point is we’re talking about a broad statement about whether it’s possible or not to prove a negative, and it is. So if it is why not say it is, unless we don’t understand why it is. The truth is we  actually do it all the time without giving much thought to it. The logic of my backpack/car example can be used for all kinds of different things. And it’s logically not meaningfully different than proving a positive. It’s just a different form of argument, but contradiction can be a very powerful tool for proving things. 

But the real point is there’s not even a good reason that anyone should feel they even have to say this. Usually it seems people say this when a theist has backed them into a corner and tried to get them to prove the nonexistence of their specific god which is difficult if not impossible to do, but proving the nonexistence of their god isn’t something that is anyones responsibility. Likewise the lack of proof of the nonexistence of their god is not proof that it exists."
25,"Scientology is a supernatural belief shared by a group of people with prescribed rituals and dogmas, that's a religion. Taoism falls into the same category.

Mormonism is very much a religion, you can't just exclude it because you don't know what it is.

The order I gave is in descending order of the ""most manmade"" (according to my own opinion)."
26,"Scientiology is classified as a religion in many countries.  It's a cult with large enough numbers, but then, that's what all religions are."
27,Its pretty much a grifters ponzi scheme barely even a cult at this point.
