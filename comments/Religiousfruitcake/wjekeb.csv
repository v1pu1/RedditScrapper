1,Who is this Gog and why did they invade Ukraine?
2,"For 2,000 years the end times have been eminent. I wouldn't hold my breath just because some Russian psychopath decided to invade a country."
3,Why aren’t the Christians raptured yet?  Seriously. Why are they still here?
4,fun fact those jewish ppl went to germany
5,"These people and their nonsense words I swear to God. Or should I say ""I swear to Gog""?

Sounds like a fucking bad guy from The Smurfs. ""The evil emperor Gog has kidnapped Papa Smurf and is threatening to bake him into a pie if he doesn't tell him where Smurfette's feet pics are"""
6,Only a theist could misspell the most important three letter word of their religion while simultaneously saying nothing intelligible in two entire sentences.
7,30000 Jews left to get their guns and defend their homeland you utter bollocks
8,"Apparently, Gog is Russia and some people/nutbars think they’re going to eventually invade Israel and that will begin the end times."
9,Gogmazios all I got but I don't think it's an elder dragon covered in tar.
10,Gog and Magog?
11,No idea. But i hope the insane Christians get raptured soon.
12,Maybe they were left behind...
13,GERMANY WE TOLD YOUUUUU
14,"Well it's not the first time Jews from former Soviet republics fled to Germany. Already happened once in the nineties. Out of historic guilt they got visa and asylum and revived the Jewish communities in many cities (sometimes in conflict with the older community).

They often spoke russian but have widespread roots in the former SU and were very present in Germany as the ones who were able to help Ukrainian Refugees and aid funds, because many had their own roots in Ukraine."
15,"To be fair to them, it´s not ""God"", but ""Gog"" what they intended to write. Different concepts

Equally fruitcake, but Gog is a completely different thing and not simply ""I don´t know how to write"""
16,Always good seeing a Monster Hunter reference
17,"Honestly I may be more of a Fatty type person than a Gog person.

But what would you say about our lord and saviour Yamatsukami."
18,Isn't that what the guy from the Muppets says?
19,"“When the Rapture comes, can I have your car?”"
20,"i want a bumper sticker that says:

**THE RAPTURE WAS LAST WEEK, SORRY YOU MISSED IT**"
21,"Hey imagine you make jews flee TO germany, good job russia lol"
22,Oh my Gog!
23,“What car?”
