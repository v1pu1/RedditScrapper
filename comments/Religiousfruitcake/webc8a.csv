1,"Not sure how something that prevents birth and ostensibly, death, could be a ""culture of death"" but, okay..."
2,"""Preventing abortion is a culture of death!""-Fruitcake Logic.

These people have gotten dumber as the years have marched on."
3,"I think I've heard about tubal ligation, but I don't remember what it means."
4,The government did it to depopulate BIPOC communities.
5,Well atleast sterilized people can't make babies = No more abortions.... Fundies happy?
6,Ahh satanism… the culture of death
7,"And christianity isn’t a culture of death?

Does it not worship a martyr?

Does it not promise death as the ultimate reward?"
8,Nice.  Now post the actual link so we can share it with people who need it.
9,"Tubal ligation is one person having say over their own body.

Christianity is the culture of death. Worshipping a zombie, eating his body and drinking his blood, can't wait until the end times, reminds everyone who doesn't believe exactly as they do that you're going to hell after you die."
10,"No no, you're using that pesky logic and rationality, the Devil's domain. 

Sterilization kills millions of potential babies each year, Pastor Jimmy said so. He and his 16 year old new bride are beacons of virtue that only ever say what God wants. Why ever would they lie about such a thing?"
11,">""Preventing abortion is a culture of death!""

Does that mean they're pro-choice now?"
12,"It's a surgical procedure in which the fallopian tubes are surgically tied. You can't get pregnant after that, so a lot of christians have an issue with women getting their tubes tied."
13,Exactly. Why worry about killing babies when it didn't show up in the first place?
14,Preach bb
15,"What’s interesting is that iirc you’re judged on the actions you did in your life, not on how often you read the bible or went to church. Meaning someone who’s an atheist, but who helps others, shows compassion etc will be more likely to be saved than someone who spent their lives actively hating on others. But they don’t want to think about that, right? They only believe what’s convenient for them."
16,I guess so lol
17,"""how dare you not releasing your eggs so I can plant my seed and make a child"" -christians"
18,But they need something to bitch about
