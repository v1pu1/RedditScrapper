1,"Mental

Fucking

Disease"
2,"a dash of ableism, too-  ""he is no longer autistic!""  Why would god kill an autistic person for being autistic when he supposedly made them that way??  This way of thinking is gross"
3,Am I half a person? At least I've got more empathy than this moron
4,"""Better dead than autistic"" has been the unofficial motto of the anti-vax crowd for a long time so this shouldn't be too surprising"
5,You're going to rot in the very hell your religion created.
6,Your kid died? God has a plan for that ;)
7,"Don't you just love it when some bible thumper says something horrible and insensitive, then throws in some god shit to happy it up?"
8,"As someone with autism, I can say with absolute certainty that I prefer to live most days, and in fact usually prefer to live with autism. And the days that I prefer not to live it has nothing to do with autism or any biproduct of that condition."
9,"People, man"
10,“Everything happens for a reason” is never the response when a right winger loses an election or some sort of climate change legislation gets passed. I wonder why?
11,“He is no longer autistic” I mean I guess not but he’s fucking dead at age 4 and in my opinion that is far more horrific than autism could ever be.
12,"""He is no longer autistic"" fuck you"
13,"I think that if someone would do this kind of shit in my presence, I would throw up ON them. 

And then I'd say something like, ""Sorry, but the complete lack of self awareness demonstrated by your platitude made me sick to my stomach."""
14,"People with this mindset make me sick. I can’t believe how people think that it’s ok blurt out most insensitive thing floating around in their minuscule brains and then justify it by bringing God into it. Not to mention, why the fuck would green say thank you? I guess they could just be saying “thanks for the enlightenment” or some shit but still!?"
15,"Religion is a blight on this world, I don't know why it isn't said more. If it makes you say that he's better now that he's dead, it's a bad thing. Not a good thing. We need to say it louder for the people in the back. Death cult religions are evil!

If it makes you focus more on post mortem punishment/reward, it is a death cult!"

17,"That's absolutely horrific and I've said it before but if you think like the person in that 1st comment please go find a hole to live in and fucking stay there. 

 I can't ever imagine saying that to anyone let alone someone I knew from the past.

If this is God's plan I think I'd rather worship the devil.  Speaking as someone with a physical disability and ADHD/ADD.   This is part of why I have issues with religious people. Not everything is good because you claim it's God's word or his plan. In fact his plan and his word are generally pretty damn awful and involve a hell of a lot of judgment."
18,HE WAS FUCKING WHOLE AND HAPPY ANYWAY YOU _FUCKING BIGOT_ !
19,I follow this subreddit  and still am surprised  every time how insane people are.
20,Be careful whatcha say around us neurodivergent types. We can be very aggressive.
21,I watched my MIL in tell my sister’s best friend that “everything happens for a reason” when saying that she was sorry for the loss of friend’s mother (who unalived herself) It was even worse because sister’s best friends mom and my MIL had been friends for many many years. I think people say it often when they don’t know what to say but saying I’m sorry and not saying anything more is perfectly fine. This is not.
22,What's wrong with it?
23,I'd take autism over whatever the fuck the blue psycho is having.
24,"Well, I mean half these religious kooks appear to have something very wrong with them, and as an autistic person, I can confirm that autism is sometimes labeled as a mental disease.
Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
25,Not a dash. A whole fuck ton of it. People kill their children because they are autistic this happens frequently with Christian fundamentalists.
26,"These fucking people will justify literally anything. Any evil, wrong will be justified for the idea of a heaven. 

Like he killed the kid and now he's whe & happy, why didn't he make him that way here?"
27,I would much rather be autistic than be so ableist and delusional with idiotic religious beliefs that I would say something this horrible to a grieving parent and think I'm being nice.
28,something something free wiil
29,"Yeah that angered me too. Being autistic is a part of him as anything else, and not something that is great to be ""cured."" If he wasn't autistic he wouldn't be himself"
30,"Yeah, if you remove my autism, I'm no longer me. The being that supposedly would enter heaven with my soul isn't me."
31,No longer has red hair either…
32,God just fucking hates children
33,"Because were all persecuting them, and have an undercover agenda or something"
34,"Nah, just another religious ah saying ""thank you"" to validate and justify as acceptable the load of cruelty just dished out by fellow religious ah"
35,"Well for one thing if you take the autism out of an autistic person, they are no longer the same person.  So if the person is right about their religion and the kid went to heaven and is no longer autistic, then what that means is that the kid died, and some other kid went to heaven wearing his body.  Now that might make an interesting horror movie, but it makes a pretty shitty religion.

That's not even getting into how shitty someone would have to be to think autistic people are better off dead because at least they're not autistic anymore..."
36,"Also, she’s implying it’s better to be dead than it is to be autistic"
37,They are projecting. I hope you don't take anything they say to heart.
38,Makes sense tbh.
39,"I'm aware, as an ex-christian I can also confirm that people welcome you there until they find out the truth about you!
That you're autistic!
_*Thunder and lightning for dramatic effect*_
And being autistic has done fucking nothing to how I would be without."
40,"I find it amazing how they abandon all traces of human morality for a poorly written, poorly translated, multi thousand year old book. They prove it right to your face too, like you said, no problems untill they discover something about you they don't like. Usually being something that doesn't even effect them in any meaningful way. They aim to opress."
