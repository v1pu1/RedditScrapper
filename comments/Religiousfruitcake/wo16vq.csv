1,There’s a lot of ‘looks like’ and ‘seems’. Looks like a lot of straw clutching to me.
2,"The earth looks flat, but it isn't.

The sun looks like it moves across the sky during the day, but it doesn't.

Plagues seem to be caused by an angry God, but they aren't.

Lots of phenomena seemed like it was ""God did it"", but it wasn't."

6,"""christianity started science""? 

Yeah coz the one thing christianity loves is - SCIENCE."
7,">Life looks designed, but it's not.

Yep. Appearances can be deceptive and humans look for patterns and narratives in everything.

>DNA looks like it contains information, but it's not information.

Nope, it does. Atheism doesn't say this at all.

>Objective morality looks like it exists, but it doesn't.

Again, not something atheism claims. It's not *divine* morality, but atheists can still debate about morality beyond that.

>The earth looks finely tuned for life, but it isn't.

See #1. Also, why are the other planets in our solar system all ""finely tuned"" not to support life?

>Everything that begins to exist has a cause, except for the universe.

Or except for god, right?

>It seems we have ultimate purpose, but we don't.

You can have purpose wherever you find it. There's no clear ""ultimate purpose"".

>It seems like we have free will, but we really don't.

Again, this isn't part of atheism. But religions that claim god is omniscient on the other hand, have a real problem with this.

>Christianity started science, but Christianity is dumb.

Various pre-Christian civilisations would like a word, thanks. Followed swiftly by scientists past and present being actively suppressed, opposed or outright attacked by theists.

As for Christianity being dumb, well, when you make trash assertions like those above..."
8,"I have a weird tummy feeling, therefore atheism is stupid and wrong.

Also, not enough faith to be an atheist? Does that mean that I have too much faith to be a Christian? So, having your worldview revolve around faith is a *bad* thing? It's almost like deep down they realize how stupid everything they say sounds but keep projecting anyway."
9,Science was not started by Christians.....🤣
10,"“Christianity started science” Christianity quite literally tried to kill anyone who didn’t believe the methods of Galen and Hypocrites.

11,"\- Life does not look designed when you actually look at it.

\- DNA does not contain information, information is the product of a mind only. Technically a disc doesn't even contain any information, it contains elements aligned in a way which we can use to store information then read as information. Information is not a natural phenomenon.

\- Objective morality certainly does not appear to exist anywhere.

\- The Earth was ""finely tuned"" by life. Our entire atmosphere is caused by the life on here, it would not exist had no life been able to be established in the oceans. The Earth is also not that rare, thanks in part to the massive number of stars and planets out there, there are a lot of Earthlike planets.

\- There is no evidence of any ""ultimate purpose"".

\- The appearance of free will has been explained by people much smarter than I am.

\- No, it just labeled the method developed over centuries as ""science""."

13,Every counter argument I’ve ever heard to atheism has been argued on bad faith.
14,"""Everything that begins to exist has a cause, except for the universe.""

Ok but from Christian logic, Everything that exists has a cause except for God."
15,This is the way stupid people make arguments.
16,None of this has anything to do with atheism. But I understand why christiand have to indulge in such gross strawmanning and dishonesty. They are bound to be christlike like this.
17,"1. life doesn't ""look designed"", and if it is, then whoever designed it did a pretty terrible job and is probably also a horrible person.

2. no serious person has ever said that dna doesn't contain information.

3. objective morality doesn't exist because god said so, it exists because i said so.

4. bold to suggest that ""the earth is finely tuned for life"" in the middle of summer

5. the universe might have a cause. i'm honest with myself when i say i don't know what it is, while you attribute it to a genocidal maniac from the worst book ever written.

6. we make our own purpose.

7. we do have free will.

8. science has been around much longer than christianity.

it's not that you don't have enough faith to be an atheist, it's that you don't have enough insight to question the narratives you've been given by an authority figure."
18,The word “seems” is doing a lot of work.
19,"""God did it"" - The battlecry of the uninquisitive drone who is told what to believe by a magic book that was written, in some parts, thousands of years after the alleged events happened, and has been interpreted so many times through so many versions, rehashes and languages that it has lost all meaning entirely. But of course, it's the *only* reliable source of information in the world.

The extraordinary amount of mental gymnastics you need to engage in to believe this nonsense is both hilarious and fascinating."
20,"“Life looks designed but it isn’t”

Bro, I was 15 when my scoliosis started to affect my day to day life, and 14 when my undiagnosed anxiety made me want to hurl myself off a bridge. Now, you are telling me that a perfect being created all of us in his image. How is a perfect being capable of creating something that is imperfect and barely suited to the environment that it exists in. I know, small example, but a good representation of a “perfect being” creating something “imperfect” is a logical fallacy, if something is perfect, by its vey nature it cannot create something imperfect."
21,"Literally not one thing on there is true, at all. And some go directly against the reality, like saying Christianity started science. That is the exact reverse of the truth. We would have had modern science 100's of years earlier if it wasn't for Christianity holding it back. And we'd also be at least 500 to as much as 1000 years more advanced if not for them holding us back as well. But just like you have to lie to flerf, you have to lie to be a religious literalist."
22,"Christianity started science?

I had no idea all those old Greek dudes were Christians. And before the birth of Christ, no less."
23,"> the earth looks fine tuned for life

This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. ~Douglas Adams"

29,"Disclaimer: The following response to this list contains quite a lot of my opinion and personal ideas. I don’t mean to come off as preachy as that’s something I really don’t like but if I do then I’m sorry in advance. You don’t have to read this if you don’t want to, I just wanted to rant for a bit.

1- Life actually is designed on a conceptual level. Not by some ancient sky daddy but by itself. Natural selection is the driving force of evolution which results in life changing to suit certain conditions.

2- DNA literally holds a ton of chemical information for every cell in every organism. Also it’s the basis of sexual and asexual reproduction so it’s also basically an assembly guide.

3- Morality is pretty clearly subjective. However, some things make a lot of sense. For example, not killing people seems like an objectively bad thing and it usually is but there are situations where it isn’t seen that way. For example, is the military morally bankrupt for killing other people. The answer (at least to me) is no as long as it is only used as a defensive tool rather than to steal oil for 3rd world countries.

4- Earth is literally the only planet where life can exist (that we know of and for now). That sounds very much like being fine tuned for life. Also, if humans were to survive on other planets they would need heavy support from technology until they adapt (which takes way too long to be viable in such drastically different conditions) or terraforming which is literally making a planet more like Earth.

5- The universe does have a cause. At least theoretically. It’s called the big bang. However we don’t know much about it but we are trying to figure that all out. What we do know though, is what came after. Gravity forces space gas together to form stars. These stars form stuff that isn’t hydrogen via nuclear fusion and then burn out. These new substances are then forced together by gravity to form bigger stars to make more new stuff by the same method. These ones then go supernova and send that newer stuff out. Then that part repeats again and makes everything else. Eventually, after a really long time, gravity pushes some of the gases around stars together and forms what we know as planets which become what we know them as after even more time. Except Earth. That’s even later and verges into natural history but basically some space rocks that had water in them hit Earth and made steam which cooled the planet and also started the water cycle. Then we had liquid water. The next important thing that happened was bacteria (which were a result of abiogenesis) came into existence and started using photosynthesis after the formation of the ozone layer. That realised a bunch of oxygen and the sky is now blue. Then the part of natural history that most people actually care about happened which is the rest of it.

6- In a way, humans do have an ultimate purpose. Specifically, the continuation of the species to be even better adapted for our current conditions. This can eventually lead to the formation of a new species and humans as we know them will become extinct. In summary, it is likely that humans (and by that I mean Homo sapiens) are just a stepping stone in the future of evolution. It may not exactly be hopeful but something better will come along and maybe fix the slowly dying planet.

7- We do have free will. Choices are a thing that people can make and most do matter. Some don’t but that’s because they are in a smaller scale. However, certain Christians (likely the kind that originally created this list) believe that if you don’t think the same way then you’re definitely going to suffer in an afterlife that may not even exist. That is not a way of thinking that is conducive to the idea of free will. But guess what, that’s their choice to think that way (unless they were born into or coerced into certain culty shit which makes this way more complicated). By the same token, it is the choice of atheists to think the way they do.

8- Christians weren’t the first to fuck about, find out and record their findings. That would be beings from species predating our own.

Conclusion- Atheism is pretty rational actually. I’m an atheist myself for a number of personal reasons and just because I can think about the world in a way different to others doesn’t make me any more or less of an atheist. That’s the cool part about atheism. Not many other atheists will bash you for sharing your own opinions and beliefs whereas religions are not only at each other’s throats but groups within religions share that behaviour to an extent. One notable example is between catholics (yes I know they have their own sects too but I’m far less versed in them) and the CoE Christians. Quite a lot of the time they’re perfectly civil but I have seen members of the two groups in literal fights over certain Bible passages. In contrast, atheism is far more diverse in beliefs as almost everyone has their own and that’s not only OK but encouraged. If you read all of this, I hope you get something out of it."
30,"I love the ""earth seems creared for human life"" argument

Over 70% of the world is ocean. 57% of that land left is either desert or too mountainous to be inhabitable.

32,Christians do love their strawmen.
33,"I guess the Islamic Golden Age never happened. And that Catholicism never persecuted scientists, AT ALL!!"
34,"""Christianity started science""

Yeah... Christianity loves science so much that it slowed it down for 1500 years.

You choose your purpose in life, it's not an imaginary man in the sky that has to tell you that YOUR purpose is to WORSHIP him. That's stupid.

Also, why would Christianity be there? Why not Islam? Why not Buddhism? Why not Hinduism or any other religion?"
35,Every argument a straw man.
36,"Old arguments, refuted time and time again but, as the “rational” side, we’re going to ignore this and continue to repeat the same bad faith talking points in the hopes of indoctrinating more people into our cult."
37,"- Life doesn’t “look designed”. In fact, observation of species’ physiology and behavior in relation to one another tends to prove that they are related.

- DNA is indeed information. Atheists do not say it doesn’t

- Morality is a sort of instinctual thing for humans that was favored as a result of our social lifestyle.

- The universe could have had a cause but we don’t know it. The “big bang” also isn’t the beginning of the universe, by the way.

- You only think you have ultimate purpose because you’ve been conditioned to believe that your entire life by religion

- we *do* have free will… Who said we didn’t?

- No religion started science, and certainly not Christianity. Hell, Arab Muslims and the Chinese were doing more science before any Christian. Even then, none of them invented science."
38,They desperately want it to be a person who created everything.
39,"Life looks random and disorderly, but it's not.

DNA looks like random bits of molecular building blocks, but it's not.

The earth seems like it was made from various chemical, biological and explosive reactions, but it's not.

Everything that exists looks like it does so through a process of micro and a macro evolution and ecological variables, but it doesn't.

It seems like we have free will, but we don't. 

It's impossible to determine who ""started science"" but whoever they were had almost definitely never heard of God or Jesus, but Christians want to steal that label without any research.

**Sorry, I don't have enough faith to be a Christian.**"
40,"* It doesn't really ""look designed"" intrinsically, we just have thousands of years of cultural assumptions that cause most people to interpret complex objects as designed. Closer examination reveals all manner of things that are consistent with unguided evolution, & you don't even have to look that close to see glaring ""design flaws."" Why is my airhole & my foodhole the same hole?
* It is information, it's just not information in the sense that is being implied here. In information theory, ""information"" is just a nonrandom pattern. A crater contains ""information"" about the asteroid that landed in it. It's not like computer coding or writing a book. DNA is a variable molecule that does things according to the pattern in which it is arranged. Patterns that kill the organism don't stick around, ones that promote survival do. No magic involved.
* If objective morality exists at all, it's certainly not in the way that religious apologists imply. Again, we have strong emotional & cultural opinions about morals, but other cultures can have very different views of morality. So, it's not the case that ""God wrote it on our hearts."" In fact, the Biblical God doesn't even follow its own moral standards, let alone what modern Christians think is moral.
* I'm going to stop saying ""cultural assumptions."" Planets have a lot of variables, but there are probably billions of them in the universe. Earth happens to have those variables in the right sequence that allows for life. We don't even yet know how widespread of conditions that life can tolerate, we just know that Earth is the only location we've yet confirmed that life exists on.
* There are several things that ""begin to exist"" but don't appear to have a cause. Radioactive decay comes from preexisting material, but it doesn't seem to be caused by any particular event. Particle-antiparticle pairs emerge spontaneously from the vacuum. Space itself expands, creating more space. The basic logic that there must have been an ""uncaused cause"" is sound, but the idea that it's in any way recognizable as a god is not. The idea that god is the only exception to ""things that begin to exist"" is like 85 unwarranted assumptions.
* I don't even think cultural standards apply here, I don't see how it seems like we have an ultimate purpose at all.
* Atheism doesn't require that one doesn't believe in free will, but it's an age-old philosophical problem, how could our decisions ever be free from any prior cause?
* ""Christianity"" didn't ""start science,"" & even if it did, there's a reason Christian apologists cling so tightly to the likes of Newton. Christian ideas haven't been relevant to science for a long time. This list already has a bunch of science denialism in it.
* Nothing here needs to be taken on faith, it just requires not blindly accepting whatever nonsense you've been told. Like let's circle back to that god thing. Nobody's ever found an example of a mind or person that doesn't require some physical object to construct their thoughts. So, he idea that this thing not only exists, but it ALWAYS existed, & it in fact CREATED THE UNIVERSE is a MASSIVE leap of faith. It remains wild to me that apologists' biggest insult is ""you're like me."" If faith is such a bad thing, just don't be religious. It's that simple."

54,"Life doesn't look designed. Every species except for really simple and old ones like cockroaches looks like it's in a transition, judging by its bone structure and organs, or even how it lives. Look at pandas: their digestive system is developed from a carnivorous one, but they developed in a way that allowed them to eat bamboo, because barely any other animals eat bamboo so they wouldn't have to compete with other herbivores. However, their digestive system is absolute shit at gaining any calories from bamboo, so they have to eat a fuckton of bamboo every day just to survive, and they're in a constant state of energy-saving. How does this look designed? Life couldn't get any more chaotic and random. Humans are partially even worse, with our bodies not being fast enough to adapt to how our societies develop, so we get sick and die from fucking cancer or diebetes. How does this look designed to people?

DNA does contain information, what're they talking about? Also, how does DNA ""look"" like it contains information? Do theists look at a picture of a helix and say ""man, that looks just like a book to me""?

Objective morality doesn't look like it exists. If it did, societies wouldn't fight over it, the objective morality would just be inside people. Even if the objective morality would just be the morality that a god uses, that morality would still be subjective. People can have ethical opinions that differ from a god, and neither of these ethical stances would be wrong, just potentially philosophically illogical. If that god is actually omnipotent and wanted humans to adhere to the god's morals, they should've worked that into their creation.

Earth doesn't look finely tuned. Eco systems collapse and change all the time. It looks like chance and randomness.

Nobody says the beginning of the universe doesn't have a cause. We just don't know it, because we can only deduce what has happened since the big bang from how the universe expands.

It seems like we have a purpose? I don't even see what they man honestly. Not even the Bible says anything about an ultimate purpose as far as I know. We exist because haven't wiped ourselves out yet. Many species have in fact been wiped out. Who fulfills their purpose now? Is the earth doomed because it can't fulfill its purpose anymore with dinosaurs, sabertooth tigers and mammoths extinct, among billions of other species?

It seems like we have free will, except that every individual is usually easy to predict once you start to understand the psychological levels of their mind. The more knowledge you have about them, the more precise the prediction. So everything we perceive and measure about humans actually points straight towards free will being an illusion we like to give ourselves so we feel superior to plants.

Christianity didn't start science. People have used scientific methods for millenia in every society. Christianity was just there and both supported and restricted scientific research, depending on how it served their goals. Christianity is responsible for funding brilliant minds, but it's also responsible for burning brilliant minds at the stake, along with their books. And yes, Christianity is generally dumb considering how it fought against scientific and social progress for the past three or so centuries, when science, philosophy etc slowly became secular because the churches lost some of their power over them."

>-Life looks designed but, it’s not

Looks designed to who? You and your humancentric perspective? There’s a million examples of it being a shitty design. And wow things can “look” a way and not actually be that way. Just because something looks a certain way doesn’t mean anything.

>-DNA looks like it contains information, but it’s not information

Who is out here saying DNA does not have information, and again who gives a fuck what it “looks like”? That is not a rational argument. You look like a dumbass when you make this argument, and you are.

>-Objective morality looks like it exists, but it doesn’t 

No it doesn’t remotely look like objective morality exists. Not if you have any capacity to think rationally, but go ahead and solve the is/ought gap if you think you can, I won’t hold my breath.

>-The earth looks finely tuned for life, but it isn’t 

The fine tuned argument has been debunked and shown to be **irrational** by countless people countless times. The horse has been beaten to dust at this point. A pothole looks finely tuned for the rainwater that fills it, but that doesn’t mean it was. This argument is again just big stroke of the ego.

>Everything that begins to exist has a cause, except the universe 

Except the universe? Is it rational for you to simply go one step back and say “god did it”? Who creates your god again? All you’re arguing here for is a causal infinite regress or that your god is irrationally the special first cause. 

>-It seems we have ultimate purpose, but we don’t 

No it doesn’t seem like we have ultimate purpose whatever the fuck that means, and once again just another “it look like” argument, which is not rational.

>-It seems like have free will, but we really don’t 

Some atheists believe we do and some don’t, and it doesn’t require a god belief either way. In fact if you believe any the main popular versions of god it’s literally impossible for **you** to have free will. Your god if true completely removes free will.

>-Christianity started science, but Christianity is dumb

No it didn’t, and yes it is dumb. This is not even a rational argument whatsoever. Even if we grant it, X can start Y, and X can still be dumb. There’s no contradiction there. “Starting” something is irrelevant, and Christianity is clearly *not* science, but it *is* dumb as shit.

>-Sorry I don’t have enough faith to be an atheist 

Rationally thinking, you necessarily *must* have enough faith to be an atheist because it requires far less faith than your ancient mystical barbaric book of tales written by dumbfuck humans who didn’t understand anything about the world or morality."
90,That's a lot of strawmen and baseless assumptions
91,"Life is an endless game of equilibrium, there isn’t design that exists outside of that fact in the natural world. When life is designed, we get fruit trees that tear in half under the weight of their fruit and dogs that need to be cut open to reproduce.

Wh- who isn’t saying DNA contains information? I mean, you can argue it isn’t information so much as a template, but semantics.

If objective morality existed, it would be harder to stray from, no? It would also be counterintuitive to success in society. Unless child labor and literal (and figurative) slavery are inherently good in that objective morality, the successful could not benefit from it.

It’s back to my equilibrium point from earlier. Earth is chaotic, and life becomes equally chaotic to survive it. Earth throws a 100 foot wave at a mountain every few millennia? The trees grow higher in spite of the poorer soil. Parts of the Earth completely cover themselves in magma near constantly? Lichen learn how to live on it once it cools.

Humanity share the same purpose as every other living thing on Earth: to survive long enough to breed. We just found it easier to do that by becoming intelligent and forming societies.

I would argue that our coexistence with society removes far more of our free will than the impulse to seek equilibrium does.

Christians took credit for science done before by Mayans, Egyptians, Greeks, and the Chinese (because experimentation and curiosity, the roots of science, are inherent to all intelligent creatures, including humans), but Christianity didn’t grow with the science, it grew _against_ it, and that’s why it’s dumb."
92,"Life doesn't looks like it is designed. We create things by designing them and we are compelled to think as ""then everything should be designed."". If you want to see it like it is designed then you try to find proofs that it is designed, not scientific proofs to satisfy smartest among us or our ""rationality system"" or ""scientific method"" which we owe everything to, but just yourself. Therefore it is seeming like there is no disproof that life isn't designed.

DNA is like a recipe for a living being, how it works? Even i can't understand and people that understand it are dedicated their lives to it and like about 50-60 years old today so you can't blame me. But it is a recipe for a human being, therefore you exist, your cat exist, the beef you ate at todays dinner exists and so on.

Objective morality is a lie, everyone has their own take at morality. Someone grown up in a vastly different culture can have really different set of core values therefore core rules. But there are obvious bad things like peer pressuring underaged kids and threating them with a lake of fire and stuff. And beheading people and shooting people because of their beliefs or disbeliefs or raping people or murdering them.

Earth isn't finely tuned for life, exact opposite: Life on Earth is fine tuned to live on earth. Who knows maybe there is other organisms use liquid methane instead of water somewhere else. Or can survive a thousand degrees but not in here because here is water instead of liquid methane and -10 to 30 Degrees Celsius on average.

Universe has a cause, but we can't observe it because we are inside of it, like the bacteria in your guts can't see other parts of your body nor outside of your body.

We aren't supposed to have a ultimate purpose, but our ego makes us think like we really matter or we have to matter in some form, but sadly but truly we really don't. We are just ants crawling in a wet pile of rock that is orbiting around a small mediocre star. We only got our fellow human friends and our plans and legacy for our future grandkids.

We have free will, but it is affected by so many factors that ""How much this guy is free compared to this other guy"" question is really hard to answer. You are free to make a choice but in the end you are the only one responsible for that, so make your choices well my friend.

Christianity didn't started any kind of science. There was scientists which were widely astronomers trying to make calendars to predict seasonal changes and they have to invent a structured way of study. And i hate to say but Christianity until Martin Luther stood in way of scientific developments."
93,The only people who have ever hurt me were Christians or people groomed to hurt others by similar Christians.
94,"Science education and the development of strong, critical thinking skills are so very, very important. Proof is clear as day when these ""Only belief in a sky-daddy can give a person morals and values!"" snake-oil buying morons attempt logic."
95,"Basically everything here is just wrong.  None of the things they say it looks like are actually what it looks like.  If life looks designed, then fuck, the designer was having a bit of an off day.  Humans have vestigal organs and are actively hurt by their upright stance.  That's bad design."
96,"I cannot even begin to describe just how much I hate associating Christianity with science, and even some dumbass atheists do it. What?!

It didn't start science, nor did it ever truly support it. Two goddamn millennia of glorifying Aristotle and cherry picking what is *allowed* to study and by *which gender*, and then throwing scraps of funding at some of the picks is not support. It's maintaining political and ideological supremacy.

Forcing people to get exposed to your cult in order to receive censored education is not support. It's gatekeeping and indoctrination.

Continuously undermining scientific education wherever it touches your dogma and individual Christians calling their shitty intuition ""science"" to post nonsense like this post, deny climate change, evolution, the fucking shape of the fucking planet, or even basic human rights is. not. support. It's literally the opposite.

Scientific progress happened not thanks to, but *despite* religion, organized or not. No one gives a shit if a religious organization funded some research, when without it someone else would, and probably sooner. Especially when it suppressed the results it didn't like, oppressed people who reached them without its supervision, and eradicated entire cultures and their records."
97,"""Christianity started science.""  OK, that's a new one I haven't heard before! 

I always thought the Greeks started that....( long before Christanity existed.)"
98,"The last line is really important.
It takes more faith to be an atheist than a Christian. How do I know? Because I used to be a Christian and I prayed for God to strengthen and deepen my faith. I kept praying and praying, eventually he answered my prayers and showered his blessing upon me. I had so much faith… but it was too much. The weight of my new God-given faith collapsed the Christian foundation it was built upon. No Bronze Age manuscript would be able to contain my boundless faith. I was left with no choice but to become an atheist.


Be careful what you pray for."
99,"LMAO objective morality is pretty easy. Even without a god being a conscious being on this planet is a rare thing. So try not to make another's experience on the planet worse as you enrich your own?

Do they really need external factors to tell them this?"
100,"What is religion but an endless cycle of “people made stuff up, then agree with stuff they made up”"
