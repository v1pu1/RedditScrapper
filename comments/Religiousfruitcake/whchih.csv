1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

3,"That's because they are churches anymore, they are businesses. A business exists to make money for the owners. At the head of any religious organization from the local startup church, to the church with millions of members, someone will be getting rich and planning to stay that way. 

You don't stay rich if you give away all your money. You hold onto it so you always know you are rich."
