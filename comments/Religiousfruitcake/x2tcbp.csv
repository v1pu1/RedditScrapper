1,Wait until they learn about the Saturn rockets or the Apollo missions
2,The horrific grammar was completely expected.
3,A jealous god? This god seems just a bit too‚Ä¶human
4,"THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE NOT GOD DAMN CHRISTIANS!!!!!!! THEY WERE DEISTS!!!!!! AKA PEOPLE WHO FELT ANY AND ALL GODS ABANDONED THEM!

Sorry I am sure y‚Äôall know this I am just trying to shout it loud enough that this fruitcake may hear."
5,"They sound like they‚Äôre in an abusive relationship with their god. Babe, if he‚Äôs jealous and you need to change your behavior because you fear his wrath, there are resources that can help you get away"
6,"""America was founded as a Christian nation"" was a line I heard constantly from my grandmother. Her proof was ""In God We Trust"" written on stuff."
7,"It fucking baffles me how me, a foreigner, knows more about the US history than Americans. Like, no, your country was not founded upon a Christian religion. In fact, nowhere in the US constitution was there any mention of God."
8,"5/7 if the days of the week are named after gods.

All the planets in our system other than Earth are named after gods.

And the karen isn't freaking about THOSE????"
9,Jesus Christ that first sentence explains it all.
10,"I worked with a woman named Dorcas, and a guy who has a son named Boaz."
11,Gods jealous lol
12,"Jelousy is against something that exist, if other god doesn't exist than yours has no reason to be jelous, or there are other one and the one you worship want to be the only one"
13,"Also, don't forget scientist have quite a few...peculiarities. When deciding how to name an experiment, they sometimes first come up with a cool acronym, and then decide what it means. For example, recently I'm studying more about the MATHUSLA experiment (for Long Lived Particles produced by LHC), and they needed so much to make that acronym that some of the letters come from the middle of the word they stand in for. Another example is DUNE, where I think a subsection is called SAND, and contains an object called GRAIN (if I remember correctly).

Scientists and names are a weird couple"
14,"I think it‚Äôs fitting to use those Greek names. That culture and history has had a huge impact on various things in the (especially Western) world. From astronomy to democracy. In fact there even was fiction written in Ancient Greece that took place on the Moon, which is kinda cool I think."
15,I'm screaming that the only like/reaction is a laughing reaction üòÇ
16,"""Greek Godness""

The stoopid. It sears the flesh."
17,Do they not know the treaty of Tripoli? Sounds like they need to learn history
18,"Yes, pray. Also hope. City still wants that water bill paid."
19,Trump is biblical.
20,"They should have gone with a biblical name like Jason, Caleb, or Tab."
21,We should start having weird biblical names for spacecraft like this is Deep Impact or The Matrix
22,"They got pretty rekt tho, damn"
23,"Because Astronomy/Astrology traditionally has greco-roman names for the planets, stars and constellations in the west and it's a nice, relatively neutral way of naming things instead of using it to try and impose your religion on everything and everyone the way you Christians would like to. 
If you Christians actually were the ones doing the Astronomy and building the spacecraft you'd probably have more sayso in naming things, but fortunately you tend to be the cretins who deny that space and the round, heliocentric earth are real to begin with."
24,Can you imagine how psychologically damaging it must be to attribute every negative thought to a judgmental supernatural source?
25,Wait untill they find out what the other planets in the solar system are named after.
26,"""Spirit well""? I've never heard of *that* in Christianity. Sounds New Agey."
27,Isn‚Äôt Artemis the brother of Apollo ? I thought that is where the name came from
28,"I think NASA should just name one ""God."" I really want to see how the loonies react."
29,"Isn‚Äôt God supposed to be perfect and flawless? 

‚ÄúJealous God‚Äù

Isn‚Äôt envy a sin??"
30,"Those didn't happen, now go pray /s"
31,"Anteres, Apollo, Aquarius, Atlas, Calipso (Calypso), Gemini, Genesis, Jason, Juno, Mercury, Osiris, Phoenix, Psyche, Saturn, Terra, Thor, Titan, Ulysses...

There has been a long tradition of mythological namesakes for NASA spacecraft (as well as those of other nations), as one would expect as humanity explores the heavens.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_spacecraft"
32,Or the names of planets/constallations in our galaxy
33,"I know it's the internet, but sheesh. Found on Christian what? Traditions? Faith? People? Slater?"
34,[What does God need with a starship?](https://youtu.be/WYW_lPlekiQ)
35,he petty
36,That's what happens when gods are made in the image of men with human emotions.
37,The louder you say it the more they are gonna stuff their fingers in their ears going ‚ÄúLALALALALALA‚Ä¶‚Äù
38,That just means most Americans get preachey about anything
39,"I'm American, I agree it's stupid. I feel like alot of the confusion comes from people considering the original pilgrims the start of America instead of the revolutionary war. I'm an atheist now, but I was raised in a small cult-like sect of Christianity. We were taught all about how the original settlers had to flee due to religious persecution so they came to the Americas to be able to practice ""real"" Christianity safely so the US is god's chosen land or whatever. 

Admittedly, I never did look to far into the actual history after I escaped the church as it didn't seem important, so maybe it was complete bullshit or some of it happened. But I think stories like this are where nonsense like this comes from. Its so infuriating and embarrassing"
40,"Fun bit of trivia: Every other planet in our solar system is named after a Roman god, except Uranus (named after the Greek god of the sky)"
41,God needs to learn to get over himself.
42,"The Jewish religion was polytheistic, then monolatric long ago."
43,"Oh damn, my husband's name is Jason! How dare his devoutly religious parents choose a Greek name, and not a biblical one!"
44,Juno has to be the most hilarious one.
45,Now they have to criticize almost every nasa rocket launched!
46,"And that's just the missions.

Mercury, Venus, (Terra), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, SOLar system, HELIOcentrism. Astronomers have been dipping into Greek and Roman mythology for ages to find names.

I'd say that those mythologies no longer having many followers is a benefit. Fewer people to offend by naming a planet after their beloved gods. Some people can get prickly about such things...

Also, the Greek titan Chronos is the personification of time. So a lot of time related terms have ""chrono"" in them."
47,"Or just the days of the week: Sunday *(Sune's Day)*, Monday *(Mani's Day)*, Tuesday *(Tyr's Day)*, Wednesday *(Woden's Day)*, Thursday *(Thor's Day)*, Friday *(Freya's Day)*, and Saturday *(Saturn's Day)*. All Germanic gods, with exception for Saturn, because let's face it, Saturn is too bad ass not to have his own day."
48,"Bale, maybe?"
49,Greek Godness üòå
50,About the best scene in that movie.
51,So is that a phony god? (Never watched Star Trek)
52,"Well first of all, the pilgrims came *after* British colonies were already functioning, they intended to land at said colonies but were driven off course.

Second, said 'pilgrims' were puritans, the same sect which later took over part of England under Oliver Cromwell and banned Christmas, along with basically any form of fun."
53,Actually Uranus is the Roman version Ouranos is the Greek not much better to be honest
54,"Yes, I love this one!

For anyone who doesn't know it, the moons of Jupiter (Zeus) are named after all his flings and affairs and they send Juno (Hera) up there for observation."
55,"*Wƒìden, that‚Äôs the form reflected in Wednesday; it‚Äôs not Wodnesday.  Also, Monday is Moon‚Äôs Day, and Tyr is Tƒ´w, (or sometimes even Tue!  Guess where that version comes from) Friday is actually named for Frigg, since *Frijjo became Frƒ´ƒ° (Friy) in Old English."
56,"*Wƒìden, that‚Äôs the form reflected in Wednesday; it‚Äôs not Wodnesday.  Also, Monday is Moon‚Äôs Day, and Tyr is Tƒ´w, (or sometimes even Tue!  Guess where that version comes from) Friday is actually named for Frigg, since *Frijjo became Frƒ´ƒ° (Friy) in Old English."
57,That was the gist of it.
58,"Uranus?

No, comrade. *Our*-anos"
59,"My grasp on Germanic is good enough to convey the point, but crude enough to deserve correction, lol."
60,Well apparently I‚Äôm just a moron having looked it up
