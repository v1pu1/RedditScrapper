1,Fighting the rainbow and diversity in the name of gray existence filled with symbols nobody understands any longer
2,"lmao some guy took two artworks from a channel called ""Christian Photoshops"" put them together poorly, added the rainbow and the tv. then turned into a stock photo wtf??"
3,Let's let the priests look after the children
4,"The rainbow was a gift from God though?

That's not very Christian-y"
5,"The boy is given something to read despite not being old enough to read. The girl who is old enough to read is given something pretty. 

I don't think the sexism was intended. I think it's subconscious bias sneaking out."
6,What's wrong with the reading rainbow?
7,Wait until the Thor comes down Bifrost and smashes that guys shield with Mjolnir....
8,Can we have a moment to talk about how terrible the photoshopping is?
9,"That TV is c.1980, which makes sense because this is clearly some Boomer nonsense."
10,"The Bible, A Guide To Irrational Fear and Hate. It's just as well the toddler can't read."
11,"To be fair, even the adult Christians don't read the bible and don't understand what's going on."
12,"Also, use the baby as a prop for the shield lol"
13,What are they gonna do to the sky though? When they're talking to God aren't they looking up to the sky? What if there is a rainbow? Is God gay?
14,That guys giving flowers to that kid because he’s actually a pedo.
15,"""cant read or even understand""

&#x200B;

Sounds like 90% of all religious people i ever met"
16,Why does the Mom have a bunch of splinters in her back? Lol
17,Looks like that shield is cracking. Muwahahaha!!! It’s working! MUWAHAHA!!!
18,"The only thing they're ""protecting"" their kid from is acceptance of other people and possibly themself.

They're not protecting their kid from ""becoming"" gay, because if the kid's gay the kid's gonna be gay regardless of what they see on TV.

If things worked that way in the first place, gay kids would've been turned straight by heteronormativity."
19,"Ok ya know what I'm just gonna start buying hammers to pop open these shields so I can take your kids to ""magical gay satan blood orgy land""

Like wtf do you think sheltering them is gonna do? I was a victim of that and look at me."
20,"That’s right kids!  We’ll teach you how to hate just lol us!  Oh, we’ll also most likely rape you… yay jesus"
21,No bigger bunch of asshats
22,"I would have more respect for them if they just said, “We hate gays” out loud. That would at least be honest, which would be an improvement."
23,Lol I thought it was an iPad because it’s so bright
24,I thought the rainbow was a created by god representing his regret and promise that he would never erase mankind again like a pestilent child with an etch-a-sketch.
25,Anyone who had never heard of Christianity but looked at Christian posts on line would assume that it was a religion devoted to hatred of gays and worship of Trump.
26,Thats right! You protect those kids from that icky covenant with god
27,"“Ahh yes my son, here’s this bible that has multitudes of stories about genocide, rape, murder and a talking snake.”"
28,It's not good for that baby's head to be holding up that heavy shield thing. Maybe that's where they all got brain damage.
29,I wonder what the hacks at the MPAA would rate a faithful film adaptation for the Book of Revelation
30,"""Here. Hold this grimoire enchanted with protection spell. We need everyone's help."""
31,What about food and medical care?
32,"aaaaaand cut to 15 years later when that sweet little gay (ex)toddler is blogging about how he was isolated, shamed, and force fed Bible stuff by his extremist parents who he’ll never speak to again."
33,"To me, it looks like the parents are being abducted by the gay TV, and so the dad gives the girl the plant so she can make the cure for gayness, and the mom is using this magical light book to make the baby super intelligent OR to transfer power to him so he becomes like jack jack from the incredibles… damn…"
34,"Also interesting that the boy gets ""knowledge"" to better himself. But the girl just gets some nice flowers from dad. First why is the dad giving his daughter cut flowers. I just bought another flower for my girls too but its so we can plant and water it and have good memories together of positive activities. Cut flowers have only 2 meanings, and i dont think daddy is apolopgizing here. They are sick."
35,Literally living under a rock
36,They are shooting it into the TV making more gay programming
37,">any longer

that implies they ever understood them in the first place"
38,"Yeah I saw that too.

Best part is that the woman and her shield still have broken arrows in them. So either the man or the little girl is a traitor."
39,"Here, Pastor Notapedo, please take care of my child while I go fight rainbows. Be a good boy Timmy, do whatever Pastor Notapedo says."
40,Nah remember that the gays stole the rainbow. Their collective gayness managed to overpower the supposed omnipotent creator of the universe.
41,"Just realized that, holy shit"
42,"I honestly was thinking the same thing. There are arrows in the mother's back, showing that this was clearly taken from another meme."
43,"Considering they keep saying Jesus loves everyone, maybe bi/pan?"
44,"Based on the entirety of the meme, looks like a really bad photoshop."
45,Needs more gay to break the shield!!!
46,Why thank you Pastor Childaround
47,"Who would win?

All knowing, all powerfull being with the power to create entire galaxys

Or

20 leather daddys"
48,20 leather daddies **in cars** (or on a bus or train). Remember the iron chariots.
