1,"Not covering up his name because he's actually kind of popular even though he has a small following he also runs Warriors for Christ which is on Facebook and YouTube.

Anyway the logo he uses for it was created by someone who is gay and while they did give them the copyright to use it they don't accept it being used in this way.

Also looking up his name on YouTube you will find some videos exposing how little he knows about the Bible and exposing that he does have a perversion himself.

But at the same time, he is a cult leader really as he's got this mindset that anyone who doesn't think the same way as he does then they are not Christian mindset or don't want to hear the truth. And yeah I have seen conservative Christians talk bad about him.

There is even a whole channel dedicated to exposing him and that person is a Christian who was even as far as being threatened by their followers."
2,I Googled Manly Bands. Apparently it's a company that sells $4 AliExpress rings for more than a hundred times the price.
3,"""A group that recruits and grooms kids"" ah, so Christianity?"
4,"I'm late to the party, but this guy is now stirring up hate in my community. Found this post trying to find out who the hell this asshole was."
5,I also remember there being a whole scandal with him where one of his followers was looking for gay hookups on tinder at one point as well. I don't know much about that but it had something to do with it.
6,"Thank you! I was about to ask, ""Who the f*** is Rich Penkoski"", but you answered it quite well!"
7,"Damn, really? and here I was thinking it was a record label for particularly husky rock bands."
8,"Yeah, I have been watching some videos done by other Christians criticizing him who do have problems with the LGBT community but bring up some fair points to criticize him.

He has been known to use his daughter's Facebook account and pose as them and then basically call people a pedophile if they reply.

His wife has been exposed as having an account on a pornographic website that he hasn't ever touched on.

And they just recently had another baby however his wife has been exposed to smoking cigarettes while pregnant.
