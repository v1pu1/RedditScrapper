1,"It must be exhausting living in fear. I thought the idea of having a sky daddy was for protection against evil. If he cant protect you from a regular ass non believer or even one of his fallen angels, he seems pretty damn useless."
2,"What a shitty thing to say about someone who went out of their way to show you compassion 

Fuck"
3,"Christians: more and more people are leaving Christianity! Why is this happening???

Also Christians:"
4,"_At first I was afraid, I was petrified_"
5,"So her devil-senses tingled *after*, not before, she found out he was an atheist. I guess those radioactive devil bite powers don’t work like in the comics."
6,Oh you should definitely head to a Catholic Church asap and ask for an exorcism! Not sure about how much of a donation they'll ask for but it's worth it! Go asap and don't wear black - wear all white especially your shoes and socks und underwear.
7,Do atheists go door to door ?  If so a bunch need to go help her with this fear.
8,"Hello mom, how’s it going…."
9,What a twat...
10,"I love how they think the feeling of anxiety they have towards atheists or anxiety about there not being a god is really an evil extra dimensional being that jumped onto them immediately after they found out they were talking to an atheist. If there were demons, why would they wait until someone said they were an atheist? Why not just hop on without warning them?"
11,"Person helping another person not expecting a thing in return just being kind (Christian value for sure)

Person wishing other person to go to hell... Sounds real accepting and kind just like the bible would want. 

Please just be good human beings it's not that difficult regardless of religion."
12,bro christianith is nothing but a joke anymore
13,"I am sure that the atheist felt the same , holy shit presence in the parking lot."
14,Weird that she felt Jesus in him before that. Her God-dar is in need of repair
15,Nice young man and an atheist. This must confuse the hell out of people
16,I can almost guarantee the crazy amount of politically religious stickers on their car covers the entire back window.
17,This was posted yesterday.
18,This sounds like something my grandmother would have said
19,"...when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness..."
20,"She’s like this now because it threw her for a loop. She thought all atheists were evil or whatever. That atheist did a great job by being a good person and not being afraid to say they were an atheist. That Christian may slowly have her outlook on atheists change, just a little, because of what that guy did."
21,"I feel like this is satire, but it speaks volumes that I can’t be 100% sure if it is"
22,why worship a god so weak that you don't feel protected in a parking lot due to the mere presence of a non-believer?
23,"Jasse, what the fuck are you talking about?"
24,"Religion is just organised, socially engineered Schizophrenia."
25,The only devil I see is her. Why would she ask the prayer warriors to rebuke herself?
26,Satire?
27,[deleted]
28,What part of Christianity seems useful?  Asking for a friend
29,They're not big on logic.
30,These people can't understand how someone who isn't just like them could possibly be a good person. It's gross
31,The precise reason I left.
32,*Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side*
33,In reality it just gives you cancer but the devil just convinces you that you get superpowers.
34,"""Hello, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Aristotle?"""
35,You expect rational thought?
36,"You'd think so, but..."
37,Definitely not satires. My family is like this
38,"It’s impossible to tell with these people. There are plenty of people who think this way. I have a co worker who is a 52 year old woman and she calls everyone demons. 

The people knocking at her door to sell cookies? Demons coming to steal her money.

Russia invades Ukraine? Demons.

Someone at our job is rude to her? They’ve been overtaken by a demon. It honestly bothers me so much she gets to act like that just because Christianity is the big accepted religion."
39,I wish I agreed with your sentiment
40,"Making money off of scared, angry, gullible rubes."
41,Several of the parishioners at the church I used to go to were cheating with other people from the church. It was frowned upon but generally sort of excepted. Then they would preach about how gays just slept around and were hedonistic perverts. It was nauseating.
42,"But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along"
43,"Nah, dontcha' know we worship Sun Tzu? smh poser bet u dont even sacrifice children or drink goat blood."
44,"My grandmother light candles after I'm gone, still I'm her favourite and I will inherit her stuff because she is upset with the village prist."
45,How much money can I make?
46,*And so you’re back from outer space . . .*
47,How unscrupulous are you willing to be?
48,Outer space is a lie from the devil to make us forget about God's firmament. /s
49,*I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face*
50,"They’re Christians. Mamma needs a new pair of shoes

Edit: typo"
51,Most of the TV guys have private planes and yachts. Not exactly the vow of poverty types
52,*I should have changed that stupid lock*
53,Then tell them that Jesus can't come back until you have a really fast private jet to get him here and they need to fund it by the end of the week.
54,*I should have made you leave your key*
55,Death destruction and Armageddon!  The recipe for riches. Understood.
56,"*If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me! Go on now, go! Walk out the door!*"
57,I guarantee one of these fuckin preachers has literally said they need to buy him a private jet so he can go and get Jesus
58,"*Just turn around now, ‘cause you’re not welcome anymore*"
59,"*And I spent oh so many nights feeling sorry for myself*

*I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high!*"
