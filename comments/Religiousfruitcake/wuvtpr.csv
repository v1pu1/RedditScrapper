1,"Biblical morality, and therein lies the problem."
2,"The problem is not what he’s said per se, it’s the fact that they feel the ability to say these things openly and without consequence. And the fact that this guy is saying such things whilst actively trying to attain a position in government, and knowing that the voting base he’s targeting will actively lap it up.

Fuck these people and their fake deity and forcing their beliefs on others. Suck a bag of Jesus dicks"
3,Yet they scream persecution when you call them out for this hateful bullshit.
4,"“Well, does that make me a homophobe?”

Yes"
5,Commit to whatever religion you want but as soon as that impacts other people it's not about religion.
6,And he says it as though it makes him the good guy.
7,Got a real purty mouth.
8,"Well, it does make you a murderer"
9,"People who advocate for old-testament morality should be bound by it.

I notice the hair on his temples looks rounded, and his suit looks like mixed fabric. He probably holds onto the wages of labourers he hires until the next day too."
10,"So he's literally saying Christians are piece of shits assholes who don't deserve to live. 

And who the fuck thinks like this. Like wtf is going in your head to even have that idea"
11,"The Bible commands men and women caught in adultery should stoned to death as well. Never see these right wingers agitating for that, because none of these Republican preachers or politicians have ever managed to keep their dicks in their pants. They police everyone else's morality, but never their own."
12,"He was arrested for harassing members of his own church, so even those he was supposedly closest to knew he was flying off the rails."
13,"Bold statement for a man clearly wearing mixed fabrics in his headshot. Deuteronomy 22:11 has very clear *""Biblical Morality""* on mixed fabrics. Christian morality clearly dictates he too, must be stoned to death."
14,No hate quite line Christian love
15,That guy is probably pretty far in the closet that he’s finds Christmas presents.
16,And there he is wearing multiple fabrics (Lev 19:19) and having shaved his beard (Lev 21:5) along with not loving his neighbour (Mark 12:31 as well as *many* others). They do love to cherry pick don't they?
17,"""I'm a Christian, not a homophobe.""

Fun fact: Those two are not mutually exclusive. In fact, there's a very high correlation between the two.

This douche nozzle thinks he can hide behind his god's skirt while throwing rocks at people."
18,"And then they look at us and ask ""how could you possibly be moral without religion?"" smh"
19,"> ""Well, does that make me a homophobe. No it simply makes me a Christian""

Whats the difference?"
20,"That makes him a religious terrorist, much like the Taliban when they stone gay people. In fact, executing anyone for merely being gay is an act of terrorism."
21,"So if I go around saying I’m a practitioner of Forn Sidr, can I blood eagle this guy?"
22,"No, it makes you an asshole who expects the whole world to believe what you believe. And by the way, Mr Christian, what happened to “Thou shalt not kill”?"
23,"Soon :

""PHOTO: Former Oklahoma State House Candidate Scott Esk exits Phoenix Rising with two companions."""
24,And they say we should get our morality from the bible... That shit is fucked up.
25,">biblical morality

That's a bit of an oxymoron, isn't it?"
26,"""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."" 

I forget who said that. 🤔"
27,"""It's what my cult teaches, can't be helped""  


""Well what if we just get rid of your cult then""  


""SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"""
28,"Let's see....The Golden Rule applies...so how about we treat him like he wants to treat others, hrm?"
29,"“If you’ve got hate in your heart, let it out”

*-Clayton Bigsby*"
30,How much you wanna bet this guy has a secret Grindr account?
31,Can we have open season on evangelicals now?
32,It's also just to own slaves according to the bible. Care to die on that hill too?
33,This ginger is officially disowned. I do not condone violence against other humans regardless of religion or lifestyle.
34,I can't even fathom saying something like this about other people.
35,Can’t help but wonder if he thinks people who speak blasphemy or steal should also be stoned to death.
36,This is where America is right now... this... is acceptable... degeneracy seems to have become a part of the american way.
37,"What are the odds that he is a sad, self hating closet case? In my experience the biggest homophobes tend to just be repressed screamers."
38,"There is a story in the bible where Jesus shames a crowd of people away from stoning a woman.  ""Only those without sin may cast a stone.""  I bet this asshole believes that if a gay man is in the same room as him it could turn him gay."
39,Psychopaths.
40,I bet he’s gay
41,"Christianity is just as violent and hateful as Islam, according to that GOP nitwit."
42,"Fuck Christians in general, but I would like to note that you can follow the Bible and not be a Christian, which this guy is doing full force.


Can you imagine how different they’d be if they actually read the cursed book they pledge their souls to? 

I’m pretty sure there’s this story with the main dude of Christianity that says “he who is without sin, cast the first stone” but that could be another corrupt book"
43,We’ll have fun America
44,Probably calls himself pro life but tries to justify stoning gay people to death. Like i don't understand these people what did gay people ever do that they deserve death? How does it effect them in anyway that people are gay and love who they love?
45,"The bible also say that adulterers should be put to death. And people who violate the sabbath. And people who refuse to accept a court's ruling. 

Now, can we please start with these kinds of biblical punishments for the people who actually believe in them and claim to be Christians? When we are done with those people, there are probably no more Christians left."
46,"As a Christian, this guy had skipped over everything Jesus ever said."
47,I doubt these cherry pickers would follow Deuteronomy 21:18-21 though
48,"It's 2022, do they not know we bash back yet?"
49,It makes you an Evil Christian. Of which there are many.
50,I can’t believe these people make it all the way to even candidacy. absolute insanity
51,"As long as we can stone adulterers. Can we start with Newt and Trump?

Also, disrespecting your parents...didn't Cruz let Trump slander his father?"
52,Ok no. I am not having it today
53,"Seem to remember that being Old Testament law, champ. You know, the thing that was negated by Jesus who then commands you turn the other cheek and all that shit?"
54,But they’re the persecuted ones.
55,"Why do I always get the feeling that these guys are  repressing their own feelings by having so much hate? I’m not gay but I really don’t care or even have interest in what gay people do… I really don’t care and it’s not something that I worry about, if they’re so concerned then let God worry about it???"
56,I don’t think he’s a homophobe but I’m starting to believe that all this gay bashing is just a veil to hide the fact that they want to fuck dudes.
57,I bet my right arm this guy digs being raw dogged by the biggest girthiest cocks out there in his free time.
58,"Didn't Jesus kinda turn that whole ""stone people for their sexual sins"" on its ear?  Please note - the only two sexual sins I believe in are rape and child sexual abuse. Adultery, sodomy, and homosexuality are between consenting people of legal age and should be only their business. None  of these are sins and never have been."
59,$5 says he's got a DL Grindr profile- they always do!!
60,"Because Jesus said ""Stone your neighbor"".....nope, that wasn't it."
61,I must’ve missed the part where Jesus stones the adulterous woman.
62,Looks like Rickety Cricket got back into the church.
63,Can we all agree that his face looks exactly like a piñata?
64,I bet he gets awfully cruel and angry when he gets to moonshining.
65,"If this is true, this guy needs to be removed from his office and position IMMEDIATELY."
66,Thou shalt not kill….
67,It’s hilarious that the same people who are scared of muslims installing sharia law are installing a similar collection of theocratic laws
68,"In the bible it Also says you should be punished for planting 2 different seeds in the same field 

It’s a stupid story book"
69,Check this man's search history.
70,This guy can just run with an alarming amount of support on a platform of literally brutally killing me and people like me. This is why I think tarring and feathering needs to make a comeback. This troglodyte deserves to feel like the miscreant he is.
71,There it is.
72,He looks like a grinning douchelord
73,Oh just fuck off.
74,I triple dog dare someone to throw a stone at my gay friends. Find out
75,"The lord should turn him into a pillar of salt

-Leviticus"
76,"*Teeth*

**Teeth**"
77,As an atheist that grew up in a religious household I firmly believe that it is just to pluck out the eyes of any man who looks upon a woman with lust /s
78,Check this mother fuckers search history and it will be full of gay porn. I’ll bet my left nut on it
79,"So if their God said it was morally justified to cook and consume babies, he'd do it, or at least preach it? I don't trust people like this one bit. Blindly following a possibly made up deity, regardless of morality, in a sense of ""As long as this book says its true, it must be!1!!"" Bunch of wackos if you ask me..."
80,Christian fundie. 😡
81,He looks like he shouldn’t be around kids…
82,What is it with the goatee people
83,"So remind me, when did Jesus himself say anything against homosexuals?"
84,Not any Christian I know
85,Isnt saying shit like that in public illegal in us?
86,Christian fundies will soon reach the level of Talibans
87,https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/08/gop-candidate-said-totally-just-stone-gay-people-death/
88,“In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point.” - Friedrich Nietzsche
89,"Even Jesus advised self reflection before condemning sinners 

“Let he without sin cast the first stone” when confronted adulterers"
90,A perfect oxymoron
91,"They want to kill everyone that isn't them.  That's biblical morality, proven throughout history for 2,000 years thousands of times.  Genocide, holy war, crusades...  It never ends. It will never end.  Religions will always breed soldiers and terrorists to increase the power of the religion.  That's how they rule.  That's how they've always ruled."
92,Biblical mortality.
93,"> The problem is not what he’s said per se

Agree to disagree."
94,Let me correct that for you. The problem IS what he said AND that they feel the ability to say these things openly.
95,"Well, this is clearly in what Bonhoeffer denounced in his time. Funny enough, Christianity was a big part on his idea. You know, his theory on stupidity.

The history is repeating again. Pretty much anyone wearing any MAGA symbol or is preaching in public should be on a watchlist and have him institutionalized as soon assaults or makes any scene.

Not very good approach, but you know, the new conservatives are the new Nazism and even worse. No contest on that. And we know what happened when Nazis got in power."
96,Oh I expect that he anticipates consequences…because he will get them…just not the type the he hopes for.  For what it is worth I disagree 100% with his statements but would also never be the one to deny his ability to make those statements.
97,There’s no way he’s getting elected after that lol. There’s no way he’s getting employed ever again either lol
98,Yes
99,r/persecutionfetish
100,Ah yes the oppressed Christian
