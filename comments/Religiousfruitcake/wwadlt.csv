1,"""AcCurDiNg tO dA BiBuL-""

SHUT UP!! *Batman slap*"
2,"Soooo god first build the pyramids, then was like 'damn, those floating triangly thingies would look so much better on a huge ~~ball~~ flat dish."
3,"I've given up hope on these types of idiots personally.

To paraphrase the Carlin quote:
""Imagine how stupid you think the average person is and then realize 50% are even more dumber"""
4,"Kjv? 

Man that bitch is the most altered book out of all of them"
5,"4,000 years now? The Earth is getting younger every year"
6,"My response would be ""You're the dumbest person I know."""
7,"If i remember the genesys genealogy, with matusalem and the other stuff they add up to more than 2000 year. Time skip between last book of the bible and jesus +2000 year from jesus to us and even in his own term his wrong."
8,Can we not just pretend that scientists found heaven load all these fruitcakes onto a rocket ship and launch that shit into the centre of the sun ?
9,"According to the bible, which is true i swear, every word is true, it doesn't matter what people think, if you ask me, even tough people don't believe in it, even tough it has been rewriten, translated, lost in translation, but it's true, and it says with a 100% certainty that it MAY be AROUND 4000 years. 

How can we doubt it in any shape or form?"
10,"There only one thing I can say to that

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
11,"“the world is x years old cus the Bible sez so”. 

Me: Checks the dates listed in the Bible. Finds only fruit and the date of publishing."
12,"I love the logic.  Many Fundamentalists believe the world is 6000 years old based on Jesus’ genealogy, which most theologians say was not meant for accuracy, but only to demonstrate that Jesus was both Son of God and Son of Man.  Most theologians also believe the King James Bible, while beautifully written, is one of the least accurate translations from the original texts (or at least the oldest extant texts).  I heard an evangelical preacher one time state, very emphatically, that if the King James Bible was good enough for the Apostles it is good enough for him."
13,"That's funny, at my church they said it was 6000 years old"
14,Always hit back with the “oh so you believe in a God that was cool with slavery? And childhood sex trafficking? And committed Genocide and treated women as second class citizens? How do you spend your menstrual days? Do you wear mixed fabrics?” What a bunch of loonies
15,Carl Sagan warned about these people.
16,"They didn't even get the fucking number right! It'd be 6022-6023 years... I'd expect a young earth christian to be stupid, but not so stupid they forget about ""AD"""
17,"So by that token, the white cliffs of Dover, given how they accumulate over time, must have been half as high 2000 years ago. Yet sat on top is a Roman building put there 2000 years ago. So now those cliffs got hundreds of feet high, made up entirely of the skeletons of dead organisms in less than 2000 years. Now that's mind blowing."
18,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

The ignorance would be amusing if it weren't so darn sad."
19,"It's handy he (I'm assuming) says outright that he takes every word literally.

It makes it much harder to wriggle out when you point out blatant hypocrisies. No ""but that bit was meant metaphorically""."
20,We have trees that are older than that lmao
21,"If stupidity was power, they can kill their own God."
22,"Sources that have to start their statements with ""this is really really 100% true"" are as reliable as people who say ""trust me"" all the time."

25,That genuinely gave me a good laugh :d
26,"what do you mean? God himself put pen to paper and wrote those sacred words in plain english 4,000 years ago when he made the flat Earth!"
27,Oh my bad. I'm sorry I forgot that only one religion can be right and it's the one with the most hate behind it! Praise jabeebis
