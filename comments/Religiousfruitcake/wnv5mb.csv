1,"What does one say to a person such as this one? He thinks all that evil is ok because his god, Allah says so. [Allah comes across as perversely sadistic in the Koran](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/ug323b/i_have_never_been_so_lost_in_my_life_need_input/i6xspbj/). Such a god should NOT be trusted as he would renege on any promise. I would fight an unjust god instead of going ass up 5 times a day to venerate him. My allegiance lies to my fellow human beings. I will not accept abject filth just because some 7th century caravan looting child r\*pist said so. Sigh.

Edit: for those who don't know ""Alhamdulillah"" in the title means:

>Alhamdulillah (Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, al-Ḥamdu lillāh) is an Arabic phrase meaning ""praise be to God"", sometimes translated as ""thank God"".

2,"At least this guy's honest with himself. Most muslims try to twist the Quran to sugarcoat slavery and claim that Aisha was very mature, both physically and mentally, for her age because of the desert environment lmao. Few go as far as claiming the 72 sex slaves in the Islamic heaven actually mean 72 raisins. I mean I would be pretty disappointed if I blowed myself up and all I got in return was 72 raisins 😭"
3,What an irony for an islamist to suggest someone to study philosophy.
4,"Bro STop

nOT All MusLims r Bad.




Even though those good ones believe this shit is okay. 

BuT ThEY arNt DoInG it So ThEY aRnt Bad"
5,"So I morally oppose exploitation of any human being, and oppose abuse of other life forms(Yeah, I'll still eat em, but don't abuse them during their life).

I hold the firm belief that those who exploit and abuse need to be forcibly removed from society as they are actively making life worse for those around them. Religious texts encourage certain forms of exploit and abuse. So you must either renounce those portions as mistranslated or otherwise illegitimate, or fall under the category of people I want forcibly removed from society.

And . . . that's not an argument? I want life to improve where and when possible for anyone and everyone, and want to dispose of those who work against that . . . and that's not a legitimate argument against a given religion? I can see ""oh, well my religion/sect cherry picked and renounced those bits"" as a flimsy but acceptable excuse for wanting to believe but not wanting to support atrocities, but outright saying ""you're stupid because you don't like abuse and exploitation"" is pretty damn crazy."
6,"""My magic book says slavery is OK, so what's your problem?"""
7,Atleast this one isn't lying.
8,"I believe slavery is always wrong and just like that, I'm more moral than Allah."
9,"God is perversely sadistic in the Torah and the Bible,  too.    Maybe he isn't the good guy"
10,"Just have the god come and tell me himself.  I don't take godly-communications from third-party hairless apes...living or long-dead.  Something on the order of what prophets have experienced.  Besides, it's not like the guy is strapped for time!"
11,I feel like I had an exchange with the same user recently. The logic and the spelling mistakes seem to match... Then again that's pretty common from the islamic side.
12,"Lol, I was just about to say, it’s even worse when you translate it.

“Aisha was…9 when that marriage was consummated, *thank God*.” 😏"
13,"“You’re very mature for your age, young lady…”

 🚩 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩"
14,Exactly. It’s like the police. It’s not some bad apples; it’s a bad barrel.
15,"For the sake of argument, I'll let everything of the past slide. I'm not gonna argue whether it's moral or not (it's not btw). Give me one reason why I should follow it in today's world while not following it isn't affecting me in any way."
16,"“[D]on’t abuse them during their life“

Er…is halal a humane method to slaughter animals…? 🤔"
17,>[Maybe he isn't the good guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWvpvlT9pJU)
18,"no idea. it seems . . . fine on first glance. I'd prefer critters to be unconscious if possible though, it not only makes the process easier but like . . . they don't know or feel anything."
19,"Yeah…while conscious, their throat is slit, and they bleed out from their carotid artery, and take one or two minutes to die.

You wanna go out like that?"
20,Not really. Unconscious is the way to go.
21,"Right, so you agree that the Halal method is unnecessarily cruel."
22,"seeing the consciousness clause, yeah."
