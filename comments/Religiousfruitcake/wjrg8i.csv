1,Rife with fallacies and unfounded assertions. Truly a masterpiece of propaganda.
2,"A very short investigation led me to discover more about this person. Below is an excerpt from a link (https://hillebrandministries.com/) on her FB page:

‚ÄòAnnette‚Äôs goal in teaching women/pastors‚Äô wives is to help them understand their role as wives of church leaders. In her training sessions she covers topics such as dealing with the physical demands of ministry, forgiving others, dealing with loneliness, four models for marriage, maintaining your marriage, being a good mother, hospitality, money matters, discipling and counseling women, the spiritual disciplines, etc. She has developed many of her lessons using the book, ‚ÄúOne with a Shepherd,‚Äù by Mary Somerville.‚Äô

3,"Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need this, but for the sake of my internal dialogue I want to respond, lmao

1.) Studies have shown that abortion access reduces the number unwanted pregnancies, and that removing that access increases the number of unwanted pregnancies. This would be a good time for the author to do some research before forming an opinion, because this is simply wrong. 

2.) having a larger population does not equate to better health. This point is just irrelevant. 

3.) There is no shortage of children who need families. More importantly, I don‚Äôt see the connection between motherhood and health. I‚Äôd need to check the data, but I believe people become less healthy due to stress when they become parents. 

4.) Birth is traumatic. Much more so than early abortion. Even more so when it‚Äôs forced by the state. 

5.) I‚Äôve never heard this point. I doubt that there‚Äôs a link between abortion and breast cancer, but that‚Äôs a position that should be easy to support with evidence if it‚Äôs true. I could be convinced, but for now I‚Äôm calling bullshit. 

Edit: Looks like the current understanding is shaky, but leans toward: [No, having an abortion doesn‚Äôt increase risk of breast cancer.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html)

6.) Men who respect women don‚Äôt tell them what to do with their bodies. By ‚Äúresponsible in their sexual behavior‚Äù, this person likely means don‚Äôt have sex if you don‚Äôt want a baby. That‚Äôs not a healthy attitude. All that said, the only relevant question for womens health with the way men are treating women is: are men getting verbal consent? Removing abortion access does not bode well for this question.

7.) I do not concede that forced-birthers value human life more. In fact, based on other policies, I think that‚Äôs blatantly false. That said, respect for human life is not relevant to womens health."
4,This looks like a report turned in by a 5th grader
5,"‚ÄúMen will have more respect for women‚Äù 

OH FINALLY a man will respect me, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been missing in my life"
6,The first point alone is moronic. You can tell this person has probably never been more than 50 miles outside of her hometown in her entire life.
7,"Annette: thanks for judging use of ‚Äúcontraceptives‚Äù. 40% of women who have abortions were using contraceptives.

Women without health insurance often wait for months to get access to birth control pills.

And many women can‚Äôt afford them.

So I hope, Annette, you are helping raise funds to help women with point #1."
8,"Fuck it, let's go

1. Ms. Hillebrand, please tell, what group of states has the highest teen pregnancy rates, and what are their abortion laws like?
2. This is also an argument for forcing everyone to have as many kids as possible.
3. Of course, because their just aren't enough available kids for all the potential parents looking to adopt.
4. Famously, pregnancy is known for having 0 complications.
5. sauce?
6. See #1
7. Female fetuses and adult women are both very similar guys, trust me."
9,Just more of the endless bloody Christian virtue signaling.
10,Number six just means rapists get to choose the mother of their babies.
11,"What if a girl is around the age of 15 to 20 , is raped and can't get abortion , how's that gonna make her health better???? Tf"
12,Are we just gonna ignore that items 1 and 3 contradict each other?
13,‚ÄúThey will be more likely to use contraceptives‚Äù as the GOP is pushing for restrictions on contraceptives.
14,"As a woman, you need to shut up. Your bible tells you so.... Timothy 2:12"
15,No. 6 oh my god. It‚Äôs like when the Governor of Texas said nobody would need abortions because they would eliminate rape.
16,"Traumatic abortions is always my favorite argument from these people. Y‚Äôall ever seen a birth????? Giving birth can easily be just as traumatic as abortions, if not more so"
17,"Not what the actual data,  decades long study or the ama and acog say. But hey reality and medical fact who needs them, certainly not a forced birther

18,What a load of dog shit!
19,"3) ""I believe women should be incubators against their will to serve the wants of other women with fertility issues because that is somehow their problem"""
20,"1) They want to outlaw this too

2) ???

3) There is no shortage of kids up for abortion

4) It will be replaced by the trauma of being forced to carry an unwanted/unviable pregnancy to term

5) source?

6) lmao

7) roflmao"
21,"To #1, aren't they trying to ban contraceptive?"
22,"You gotta love how she doesn‚Äôt think that the people who wanted Roe overturned also are actively attempting to make contraception illegal as well. We already had a Republican congressman attempt to introduce a national ban on condoms, for Satan‚Äôs sake."
23,It‚Äôs so ignorant it hurts
24,I call bullshit on this lol god help u America üòÇ
25,How to slap someone through a newspaper
26,Much like how buildings are safer from a fire spreading when the fire extinguishers have all been removed first.
27,"it sounded silly until points 6/7

then it sounded like outright fantasy lmfao"
28,Just more proof that American Christianity really does dumb people down.
29,Statistically speaking she should have gotten something right by accident here. Not even luck is on her side.  Epic fail.
30,"She speaks as if babies are not being born everyday that are either unwanted or in foster care.

Also, dear, if he can‚Äôt respect you as a person he certainly won‚Äôt as a walking womb.  Because we all know how well it‚Äôs gone for women past. In fact, a couple of your bible stories are quite illustrative on the matter.

Sarah can‚Äôt get knocked up? Buy a slave. Have your husband rape said slave and then toss her and her child out into the desert once you have your own because that isn‚Äôt traumatic at all. Guess Abraham respected her too much to keep her.

And there‚Äôs more, many more, but I‚Äôd be typing all night."

32,Nonsense but I do wonder is there any truth in the first statement?
33,![gif](giphy|h8HmN0UcEKR0xWnv3R)
34,"‚ÄúDisciplining women.‚Äù You just try it with me, twat-waffle, I‚Äôll rip your fucking arms off."
35,You beat me to this. I was going to start googling the name. Lol
36,Barf
37,I knew I had encountered her name at some point in the past
38,"Another issue I had with this fruitcake's points was about contraception. [Plan B's effectiveness goes down for those above 165lbs](https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/emergency-contraceptive/plan-b-in-overweight-women#:~:text=Plan%20B%20effectiveness%20and%20weight&text=Studies%20suggest%20that%20Plan%20B,BMI)%20at%20or%20above%2030.)

The average American woman weighs more than that. Of course, there are other ways of contraception, but a safe way of abortion is necessary.

2) Forcing births, especially for people who are affected by a loss of abortion access, will only lower general population wellbeing. A lot of people getting abortions already have children and can't support another. More children born in lower socioeconomic classes, less nutritious food, less access to healthcare, etc. If anything her point is just flat out wrong.

4) Aborting an unviable fetus is less traumatic than knowing it is and being forced to carry it to term. But these people never think of that.

6) If anything, it just shows the lack of respect for women.

7) Pro-lifers don't care about that fetus after birth. That's why none of the ""Choose Adoption"" protesters have adopted kids. As soon as it directly affects them, they'll bend the rules to their favor."
39,"Also adoption can be traumatic for the person that is adopted.

Imagine having to learn that your parents never intended to have you in the first place, and the only reason you exist is because abortion is banned."
40,"I'm glad you typed it out first, because if you hadnt i would've. Agree whole-heartedly!"
41,"""Human life in general would be more respected"" makes me think of George Carlin saying ""they don't care about you till you're military age, then you're just what they need, they want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers"""
42,"Can confirm #3.


Can't remember the last time I had a complete restful night (now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go take a 15-minutes nap...)."
43,Your 6 makes me think about the policy makers considering not forcing men to pay child support as a way to...encourage women not to get abortions?
44,">6.) Men who respect women don‚Äôt tell them what to do with their bodies. By ‚Äúresponsible in their sexual behavior‚Äù, this person likely means don‚Äôt have sex if you don‚Äôt want a baby. That‚Äôs not a healthy attitude. All that said, the only relevant question for womens health with the way men are treating women is: are men getting verbal consent? Removing abortion access does not bode well for this question.

I believe her 6th point was that *men* would be more responsible in their sexual behavior,  if there are no abortions, by not having sex with women. This bimbo is either *very* young or *very* ignorant! The men who want to get rid of abortion *have never and will never* ""be responsible in their sexual behavior"", nor do they have any respect for women. To those men, women are simply a commodity for them to utilize."

46,That‚Äôs probably an accurate assessment of the extent of her schooling.
47,I respect you for this comment.
48,"Stupidity knows no boundaries, I‚Äôm afraid. In her case, while she is from the US, she resides in Ukraine."
49,And to think this woman is in a leadership role in her community...
50,"Men are going to respect her more as per gospel #7, duh!"
51,"My preference is to ignore this whole thing.

Just wish I could erase the part of my brain that has imprinted this reading misadventure to memory."
52,I only follow Austin 3:16
53,"""it's not rape if bebe"""
54,Your counterpoints to 6 & 7 were my favorite ones so far
55,The whole piece is full of these super fun and not at all infuriating tidbits!
56,Absolutely not

58,"Not disciplining, discipling. Making disciples out of women.

Your joke is funny tho."
59,"For sure, that would be absolutely horrible. I imagine that it won‚Äôt be clear whether or not the mother would have got an abortion if she were able, leaving an entire generation of kids wondering. Ugh"
60,"Thanks, I worked hard on these!"
61,You are probably right.
62,haha! I still love this
63,"Toe-may-toe, toe-mah-toe tho? XD"
64,"Definitely a joke!! 

Not dyslexia at all, nope, nope, nope...."
65,Still much more solid and accurate points than hers.
66,"*The man got away, leaving behind evidence*

I was attacked by some idiot in the projects

67,Byeah
68,Are those points? I thought it was text prediction software gone wrong!
