25,"Talk to your wives sisters and most likely daughters about that. 

Since they’re so blood thirsty why not kill Russians?  They get their appetite sated and justice is served. They could actually be on the right side of history for the first time ever."

39,"That's why Pakistan is dead last on the list of countries which can visit other countries without a visa.

49,i hope u realize that this is probably from the other sect of Islam you know the violent ones and the other larger sect is the calm and normal one so i don't think you should just generalize one of the biggest religions in the world just because of a minority in that religion
50,Are you willing to pay $20 mil for it tho?
51,"Go USA, do your thing"
52,[deleted]
53,Sounds like Grindr is more up his alley
54,"Geert is kind of anti Islamic and has done some really provocative things; but no one needs to be threatened with death. I hate how he and his party and some other right wing parties basically block progress in our parliament because the inability to work with them, and leading to (in my opinion) skewed votes if you look at the things that should really be politically addressed (healthcare, elderly care, etc); but everyone has the right to vote for him and he has the right to spew what he spews without fearing for his life."
55,Ben je dom of nieuw in Nederland?
56,To give head?
57,True. I don't want head. I'm watching Anima
58,Not gay if it's not a man giving the head
59,Not if he said no homo first
60,"I mean, if he likes spicy food, anime and hiking and looks kind of feminine, I'm not seein' a problem here...?"
61,Not true if u read his book u will find out that it's a bout his own doubts and religious questions
62,Why on earth would people hate islam? .. followers are always showing the world how pieceful they are. It just seems to be a religion that promotes all this piecefulness.
63,He's doing god's work. Good for him!
64,Good for him.
65,I can't stand the guy and his even more right wing colleagues but no one deserves to be threatened to death. Also the last right wing politician killed in our country only sparked more right wing parties and voters I feel.
66,He’s a real piece of dogshit but nobody deserves to undergo physical violence especially over their stupid opinions.
67,"""...I am god.""

\-House without context"
68,did you ever realize that 70 virgins could also mean 70 *male* virgins? Terrorists are gay. Even 9/11 was gay: a hard long thing hit another hard long thing.
69,Fair enough
70,Depends on who it is
71,The CIA itself is a terrorist organization.
72,[removed]
73,🤡
74,Yeah he was a Muslim and hates muslims and has even written a book insulting Islam and the prophet MUHAMMED.
75,You don't know a lot about the pvv then a lot of parties don't wanna work with them before hand while the PVV is a huge advocate for better elderly care healthcare welfare etc etc he just doesn't like migrants miss behaving and the Netherlands is getting full that's just a fact
76,Ja mensen met een andere mening dom noemen dat is een goed plan!
77,Straight women like dick and are therefore gay
78,Not gay if you're wearing socks.
79,[deleted]
80,Questions are insults when youre a loon
81,Did YOU read the book?
82,Fvd and Baudet are literally calling themselves ‘the next Fortuyn’
83,"I mean, the guy is literally threatening others to death. Asking his supporters ""Do you want more or fewer Moroccans? "" and wanting a ""ministry of de-islamisation"" doesn't sound like genocide threats to you? He can go suck a dick."
84,than wtf was ww2 fought over??
85,"If your ""stupid opinion"" is that a minority group should get gassed then you absolutely deserve to undergo physical violence."
86,They're really good at killing terrorists tho
87,🤡
88,"Well it's not really 'beforehand' after they tried working with the PVV in 2010 and that failed pretty miserably. And yes that's why I mentioned the healthcare, because that's a part where he's actually more left leaning but because the overpowering for us on immigrants there's not much progress in socialising the healthcare better while there probably
might be a majority of voters for it. And he's expressly targeted the Muslim community with his films, so it's not just 'immigrants that are misbehaving ' although that is what he likes to pertain the last couple of years. But yeah, he's less polarising and hateful than Baudet."
89,Mastrubation is gay because ur touching dick
90,">Straight women like dick

Idk who told you this but I don't think it's true."
91,Glad to be of help.
92,I did
93,oh how embarrassing
94,They feel so different to me. Fortuyn seemed to be sort of a reasonable guy with thoughts and worries that I didn't agree with but at least he seemed like you could talk to him. Baudet just feels like a vile person that would take any stance if it would give him followers and admiration.
95,"It definitely does. But we have law enfoecement for that, it's never okay to threaten anyone to death and if one dies one is as low as he is."
96,What do you mean? Freeing most of Europe from a murderous authoritarian regime for example?
97,[removed]
98,Afghanistan might disagree with you there.
99,Also at killing their innocent children
100,My uncle who works at nintendo says so
