1,"God's going to destroy America?!

Fuck you, god! You're a piece shit and aren't real! I'm more omnipotent than you are!!

Hopefully god is on reddit."
2,So mocking god caused the planet of the apes?
3,"Imagine being an ageless, perfect being...and still being emotionally immature enough to get tilted when a hairless ape on a moistened ball of rock way out in the middle of nowhere says something mean.

...yeah, it makes no sense to me, either."
4,They ripped off the 1968 Planet of the Apes ending. Not at all original.
5,"God sounds like a really nice, chill fellow."
6,"I guess the New York, New York casino in Las Vegas better watch out. Whoever photoshopped this couldn't even bother to use a real photo of NYC."
7,More like humans are going to do it. Climate change and all that
8,"The only ""consequences"" seem to be that believers go ape shit and try to tear down society.

""Believe in my God or I'll get big mad and shoot the place up. The fact that I'm going to shoot the place up is evidence of God's anger."" 🤡🤡"
9,Mocking which god? There are too many magical sky people...
10,Contraceptive is mocking god. So what's the point?
11,Is that a threat?
12,Your god is weak if they are susceptible to human insults.
13,"![gif](giphy|cwKEyFg7TY0o0)

God got tired of us mocking him so he decided to give apes a chance?"
14,"Alleging that god exists as a substantial savage snowflake sure has consequences, & these empty threats by allegiants are at least one of them."
15,Jesus people or Halal fruitcakes?
16,"So one of the only main religious christian country will fall because some people mock god?

I am happy to live in a laic country then"
17,[deleted]
18,Which one
19,Depends which god you mock
20,oh really? If the mf is so powerful why doesn’t he just kill the devil then? and why has he never done anything to anyone in any capacity ever?
21,"I love the catchphrase near the lower right corner, “The real truth movement.”  Based on what?  Your outdated, made up, book of fairytales?"
22,"So what they're saying is God is a petty, vindictive tyrant who will use his power to destroy anyone who doesn't properly suck up to him."
23,"I don't even understand the implication. Like, the political state known as the USA will not survive the Statue of Liberty's destruction? Liberty itself will end? All for, what, ""mocking"" God?"
24,"Yeah, God's followers might destroy your country."
25,"I can't think of anything scarier than an immature, uptight, ultrasensitive, insecure being who is also all-powerful.  Remind me of that Twilight Zone episode with the little god-kid."
26,"So if I mock God we can go to the amusement park? Sounds good.

>!(Mirabilandia park in Italy, the attraction's name is reset)!<"
27,"Funny how it's always their worshippers that seem to be the only ones acting. Either their gods are really weak, the believers are wrong about what these gods want, or they simply don't exist and the believers are just assholes."
28,You maniacs! You blew it up!
29,The consequence of free speech and liberty is religious terrorism.
30,"There is no God, the Easter Bunny told me so and it was confirmed by Santa Claus-although he Was a bit drunk at the time."
31,"Is this ""Reset"" at Mirabilandia amusement park, in Italy?"
32,And this isn't one of them
33,...this is not very well drawn
34,such as an ape uprising?
35,"God is Dr. Zaius?

“It was earth all along! You really made a monkey out of me!”"
36,They'll burn it to the ground if they don't get their way.
37,"LOL. I'm an atheist, and have no use for religion. Yep, I do mock belief in a god, yet here I am living well, happy, and retired.  The consequences of non belief is the knowledge that it's science that has advanced the world in all of the ways we live better and healthier today while it's religion that has always held progress up."
38,*Get your hands off me you damn dirty ape!*
39,Ooo shiver me timbers
40,"If you mock god he will knock down a big statue that stands for human rights.

Well all righty then!"
41,"How much mockery is required to reach the critical threashold required for consequences?

Because people have been mocking god since the beginning of time"
42,"Just a friendly reminder that God isn't real. 

Magic is for fantasy novels and video games."
43,You maniacs!
44,“The Real Truth Movement”🤣🤣
45,Like what…. Laughter?
46,Are they threatening to bomb the Statue of Liberty?
47,Jesus smesus mockidy mock mock mock.
48,"Meh, Tahiti Village has the better deals anyway"
49,Why is the only thing I hear in my head is that consequences sketch from Key & Peele?
50,You damn dirty apes!
51,The consequence is that we will live in a society with significantly less idiots
52,"Don't worry, Joe Pesci has us covered."
53,"I mock this god thing all the time and *nothing ever comes of it.*

There is no respect for this god thing, just contempt for it and the morons who peddle that garbage.

I fear NO god. *The moron zealots terrify me.*"
54,My mockery of God has resulted in the Statue of Liberty falling over??? I wonder what else my irreverence can do???
55,(Everything god supposed to be) + (how gods faithful behave) = atheism
56,Such a fragile and insecure God that they destroy this beautify city causing who knows how many deaths just because someone mock them. Lol.
57,"fuck! this is huge if true.

do we know which god will do this so we know which one not to mock?"
58,"I’m sitting here on my couch, openly mocking god. No consequences.

But if I mock religion in front of religious people, they would feel justified in doing horrible things to me.

So I know who the real threat is."
59,mock god and the religious will destroy the place?
60,That all that old fucker’s got?
61,This is their fetish. They WANT this to happen
62,"The same god who doesn't bat an eye when innocent children die of starvation is going to destroy the world because someone mocked him? 
How divine"
63,"Catering to the whims of a higher being with blind obedience who enforces this obedience with threats, torture, and various other acts of narcissist-fueled cruelty also has its consequences. Look at what that did for the people with Putin, Sadam Hussein, etc. If it's that bad to enable mere mortals like this, imagine what it is for a being that is omnipotent relative to humans?"
64,Those words eith that picture seem like a clear threat of terrorism.
65,The only thin missing from that picture is some apes on horse back
66,The US sucks anyway.
67,He's more of a Gab troll
68,"wait, If the big guy’s gonna destroy ’*MURICA*, then why do they say “god bless america”?"
69,"God, sitting in his armchair, lit slightly by his phone screen: ""Hey.... 🙁"""
70,AITA for destroying America?
71,Hasa diga Ebowai!
72,Looks like Las Vegas will be the first stop.
73,"""God damn them all to hell!"" -- Charlton Heston."
74,So they don’t believe in evolution but reverse evolution is okay?
75,"[Oh, Dr. Zaius](https://frinkiac.com/video/S07E19/ocm5xUzjN6qX07Ykqm2FZ1MF8Dg=.gif)!"
76,"And that ball represents 1 unit of mass for every 7*10)29 units of mass in the universe.

7000 billion billion billionths of the whole universes mass, even less if we go by volume.

Literally more petty than if a human got mad that the bacteria on a spec of sand on the other side of the world behave in a way that doesn't take your existence into account."
77,Just like how god is in that show Preacher.
78,"This is exactly what baffles me. An all knowing, kind, compassionate being of love and care is so sensitive that me making one mistake is going to offend him. Seems like they forgot who “God” is. From what they describe, he’s not human. He’s not petty like we are. 

Most of these “God will punish” stories seem like those satisfying revenge plot lines to me. They want those who disagree to suffer, and enjoy the idea that disagreers will rot in hell."
79,"Woah dude, spoiler alert!"
80,Who is this god person anyway?
81,Clearly Ahura Mazda is upset we aren't listening to the word of Zoroaster.
82,This one especially https://pastafarians.org.au/
83,Don’t give them ideas
84,Ikr!
85,"They're very much the same when you boil everything down, but on the plus side, I had some excellent falaffel at the Halal food truck up the street."
86,Messaging was never one of Christianity’s strong points: accept our Lord Jesus or burn in hellfire for all eternity
87,"Zoldheran the Irrefutable, of course."
88,You could have stopped the sentence after “anyone” and left it with that.
89,"At this point, I'm not surprised if they did, given that the statue is slowly losing its purpose to exist."
90,I looked through their postings. I had a good laugh.
91,"'God blurse America,' I guess."
92,"NTA, it was a shithole while it existed anyway"
93,It's the only way to get through all these troubled times!
94,"""Too late roflmao"" -- god"
95,Those damn dirty apes!
96,https://youtu.be/XvuM3DjvYf0
97,[darn you!! darn you all to heck!!](https://youtu.be/yFyychwqv10)
98,"mhm. Even if a god existed he would have no *reason* to give a shit.

I don’t care if a bacteria doesn’t care about"
99,If you use closed parentheses it sets the next set of characters to superscript
100,"If no one has seen a movie from 1968 by now, it's too late for spoilers. 🤔"
