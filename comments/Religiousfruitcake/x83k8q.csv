1,"Well, it looks like the kind of white van my parents always told me to avoid when I was a kid..."
2,Not gonna lie I thought they were driving him around in a big fish tank
3,So let me get this straight... The pope is representing God here in earth yet he needs a vehicle with bullet proof glass? I mean wouldn't the same almighty dude who apparently created the earth be able to protect his representative?
4,Don't ride around in a silly car if you don't want people talking about your silly car.
5,"Huh, to most normal people the term ""pope"" is also undignified. So why care about the mobile part?"
6,"How about the cult mobile, I thought sounds better"
7,Popemobile popemobile popemobile popemobile popemobile popemobile popemobile
8,"The thing is, the Vatican never really took an official position on what it actually SHOULD be called, and it was called the popemobile well before John Paul II. It's even got basically the same name across all languages, even in very Catholic countries like Italy or Poland. And no other Pope has ever commented on what it should be called.

Poles seem to have a peculiar cultural obsession with keeping up appearances, and John Paul II was no exception. But it's not a stiff upper lip quite like the British ideal. I see more parallels with China and a lot of Arabic countries."
9,I'm sorry i just read pedomobile
10,You just know that there is an air mattress in that thing stained with tears of hundreds of altar boys

12,"He obviously wasn't aware that being a Pope was undignified. Especially paedo protector scum like JPII. The man was pure filth. Pope is synonymous with leader if the world's oldest, wealthiest international child rape cabal."
13,"pope: Stop calling it the popemobile!  
The article: ""The pope requested that the media stopped reffering to the car as the popemobile..ANYWAYS IN 2007 THE POPEMOBILE"""
14,I love how literally the next sentence starts with calling it the pope mobile
15,Pope on wheels?
16,Oh no. It's flooded.
17,Nanananana leader
18,At least trick that bitch out. Are those stock hubcaps?
19,Brought to you by mobilpope
20,I wonder does the Vatican still use that car? Pope Francis seems like he'd just take an Uber.
21,Why doesn’t he trust God to stop any bullets?
22,“Oh no! Anyway-”
23,"Sorry man.  It's the popemobile always and forever.  If ya didn't want it called that ya shouldn't have made it so popeish.   Paint a car black and give it wings, we'll call it a batmobile.  Make it like like a weiner,  we'll call it the weinermobile.  That's just the way it is."
24,"Freaking ugly car, would never drive such a shitshow"
25,"""Stop calling it the 'popemobile!!' said the Pope. So anyways, he took the popemobile...."""
26,Undignified ? Have you seen how ridiculous that shit looks ?
27,Does anyone know the full article I want to know what happened in 2007
28,How often did the pope stake out your home
29,I wonder if it plays the ice cream truck jingle
30,"Considering the the church's history, that's sound advice."
31,Aw shit and you know they’re all about symbolism
32,i thought it looked like one of those dunk tanks at the carnival. 25¢ to dunk the pope! step right up!
33,the pope needs to be kept moisturized or else he will rapidly degrade
34,There’s always a way for these people to explain away the impotence of their deity..it’s like watching children argue which superhero is stronger.
35,">  The pope is representing God here in earth yet he needs a vehicle with bullet proof glass? 

That doesn't show a lot of faith in his god's protection"
36,Something something God's plan blah blah mysterious ways yadayada nothing could be done...
37,It’s because I’m the past pope’s have been assaulted either by people who hate them or by people you love him.
38,I see plenty of vans and suburbans here carrying Mormons and JWs
39,Yh more you have to be silent rather than stoicism
40,Rzułta morda
41,"thanks for the explanation, i wouldn't have understood it if you didn't specify who said what using colons and also put emphasis on the funny part"
42,When the recap is just as long and more confusing
43,I think it was one of his employees
44,It plays a boring jingle.
45,if the Pope did that I would become religious.
46,Would the dunk tank be full of holy water?
47,...don't visit r/whowouldwin
48,"But since it's his creation, he has also invented bulletproof glass and intended for it to be used! So actually not using it is blasphemous! Checkmate atheists"
49,Who is upvoting it? It reads like a YouTube comment
50,after he got dunked definitely
