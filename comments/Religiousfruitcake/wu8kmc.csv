1,"what churches are safe in what middle east? 

Egypt literally keeps guards in every church because they keep getting threatened and attacked."
2,"That list is pathetic. 

Shit online and graffiti are in the count as attacks."
3,His own country -Iraq- got most of its Christian population wiped out or forced to emigrate
4,That’s not true. Die biggest religious problems in Iraq are between Muslims.
5,"That’s ~~not~~ true.

Many of them fled Iran to western countries. And they also are not delighted to see bigger and bigger waves of (extreme) moslim-refugees entering their new country that had welcomed them maybe decades ago. Some that are here over maybe 30 or 40 years see the same thing as back then happening all over, though slower than in Iran."
