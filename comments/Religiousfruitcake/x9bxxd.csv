1,"True enough, may his noodly tentacles bless you. Ramen"
2,I have an imaginary enemy.
3,"‚ÄúDespite the obvious‚Ä¶‚Äù 

The only thing obvious here is that belief in god is based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof. There is no evidence, that is why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. Denial makes you an enemy of logic."
4,How does someone say something like this without it occurring to them that they‚Äôre a fanatic?
5,"Go ahead, show me the evidence and I‚Äôll believe‚Ä¶ If it actually qualifies as evidence that is, so far no theist who ever said they had evidence, knew what evidence even means‚Ä¶"
6,Presented by a human that is too dumb to know how dumb.
7,"‚ÄúFreya of Dorset, Enemy of God‚Äù sounds much cooler tho"
8,"*""obvious natural and scientific evidence""*

I don't think this guy's mind is firing on all cylinders.

Science is the study of the natural world, there's no *""and""* there.

Also, in that pursuit, every time science has advanced into a domain previously attributed to any god, said god was no where to be found. Not a single phenomena ever deduced by science has detected anything divine, spiritual, or supernatural. Not a single one.

Very telling that all gods exist just beyond the veil of human ignorance. It's because that's what they were created to be. They are all made in our human image, and given refuge in that ever shrinking island of human ignorance. One by one they are drowned in the ever rising tide of human progress.

I'm no enemy to gods, any more than I am an enemy to dragons, unicorns, trolls, ogres, gnomes, goblins, elves, dwarves, fairies, pixies, centaurs, satyrs, minotaurs, and the long long list of fanciful mythological creatures forged by our vivid human imaginations. The were born because we allowed it, and they will die because the human intellect demands it."
9,I guess if those are my choices then I‚Äôm an enemy.
10,[deleted]
11,Neither. God doesn't exist.
12,I‚Äôm not an enemy of god. I‚Äôm a terrorist for atheism.
13,Which God does she/he mean?
14,Well we definitely have the better music.
15,"Haha ""teleology""....

Damn, can't even name their ""science"" of imaginarg friends rights..."
16,"Of who, you are using a vague term that doesnt refer to one being but instead a title. Do you mean your deity, yahweh?  And no just naming feilds of study doesnt constitute proof. I wouldnt just say ""particle physics disproves your deity"" and walk away and expect you to deconvert on the spot."
17,I just got fitted for my anti-god uniform. Off to boot camp. Cya.
18,"Well alright then, guess Heaven is about to catch these hands"
19,"I'm an enemy of God just as much as I'm an enemy of Sauron, Thanos, or any Goa'uld.  All characters that have done morally reprehensible things.  They are also all fiction, so no real person is actually THEIR enemy (or friend for that matter).  I don't like them, and cheer when they die (especially Zipacna, he knows what he did) but that doesn't make me their enemy.  Fictional characters can have people that make those characters too important to their personality, but they are still not friends nor enemies, just people with mental health problems that need help."
20,"Me: care to present the actual evidence?

Them: *either run away or post some dumb fallacious arguments.*"
21,"Cool, maybe he wants to team up with the Easter Bunny and fight me."
22,"Teleology and morality are philosophical topics. Not science. The use of evidence isn't the same and it doesn't have the same level of scrutiny as the scientific method. If it did, it'd be science.

Like, with teleology, you make a claim about the purpose or end goal or use of something, then you come up with evidence to support that. In science, that's *a* way to come up with a hypothesis. But then the amount of testing to get to a theory is immense.

Christians have a notion of teleological evidence for god. Basically, man exists to know god, so god must exist. You can tell because of x, y, z features of humanity, some of which may even exist outside of their narrow cultural context. And/or you can tell because of x, y, z thing written in an old book. It's all very circular."
23,GOD EXISTS BECAUSE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE Y‚ÄôALL
24,"> despite the obvious natural and scientific evidence we have...

Obvious to who? The people making up this evidence? Because there is no evidence in our DNA, for example, of God.

> So what are you: a friend or enemy of God?

I've already had one imaginary friend as a kid, so I guess I'll give having an imaginary enemy a go."
25,Dah faq is teleogoly?
26,"If God exists, I don't think he's on people like that's side."
27,Santa is more powerful than 'God' could ever hope to be!
28,"I guess I‚Äôm a proud enemy of god, then."
29,Oh fiddle dee dee‚Ä¶ it looks like I‚Äôm an enemy of ‚Äúgod‚Äù
30,"ok but hear me out: What if god IS real. But it just so happens it was inserted at the beginning of our timeline and imbued with special powers over our reality by the person who initiated the simulation? God would be just as trapped as we are.

Disclosure: I would not consider this my belief, just a thought experiment. Literally anything is possible."
31,"Some people have imaginary friends, apparently I have an imaginary enemy"
32,"What god are we talking about, I know plenty."
33,"Well shit I prefer enemy of god to enemy of  logic and reasoning.

You know what's amazing about science and reasoning? You don't have to rely on books and teachings of people that thought stoning for disrespect was an appropriate punishment. Ya know death for midly challenging your parents.   Or being called evil for *gasp* eating shellfish and wearing mixed fabric clothing. 

That is your brain on religion. Your brain on science and  education will tell you that everything I just described sounds completely asinine  and ridiculous. 

People might say oh well that can be disregarded now. Well that's just grand but I still think people  back then could understand hey I watched someone get sick eating that I shouldn't do it. Also back to the clothing thing. All I have to say is damn imagine dying over a very comfortable shirt. Like the ones we have now. 

Sounds really damn idiotic if you ask me."
34,How am I gonna be a friend or enemy of some shit I believe doesn‚Äôt exist?
35,You first  need to tell us which God you are referring too
36,Mwahahaha! Feel my powah!
37,"I too look at the 90+ billion light year, 13 billion year old universe and think ‚Äúyeah that was definitely made for me‚Äù"
38,I‚Äôd go to war with god if he was real. You ain‚Äôt gonna flood entire nations or drop asteroids on my watch asshole lol
39,I'm not an enemy of God or Lord Voldemort because it would be stupid. Not as stupid as claiming that there is evidence they exist but still stupid.
40,I don‚Äôt think they should be allowed to use science against us Athiests.
41,"What is the scientific evidence of my teleology? It has not been revealed to me. Maybe I should ask a scientist, like the pope."
42,Me when I jump to conclusions ü§≠
43,I'm a stilted acquaintance.
44,Obviously not obvious; none of those fields especially morality confirm the existence of ANY deity.
45,I'm more into Hordes of Chaos but Enemy of God is still good.
46,"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit


Ultimatum"
47,Like people say a lot online:  proof or it never happened.
48,My cats are certainly more power than they're gods. My cats actually do smite me if I don't do what they demand.
49,"Well, I don't believe in dragons either. Am I an enemy of dragonkind by this post's logic?"
50,I refuse to engage in the mental minutia gymnastics to be a friend or enemy of something does not exist.
51,"That also means you are the enemy to the tooth fairy, the boogie man, the Keebler elves, and any other fictional characters‚Ä¶"
52,Enemy.
53,"*oh the misery*  
*everybody wants to be my enemy*"
54,I don't have imaginary enemies.
55,"Even if that stuff was indicative of a god, which it is not, why do you think it is your god? It seems the chances are just as good that it was any of the other thousands of gods that humans have believed in over the years."
56,All religion is cancer. Which camp does that put me in...?
57,*god damn it feels good to be a gangsta plays in the distance*
58,"Enemy, definitely enemy"
59,Evidence hahahahah.
60,Neither because God doesn't exist...
61,"Can something that is made up and doesn't exist have enemies?  

I mean Luke Skywalker has Darth Vader, but both of them are made up.  So is God and Satan.

It's all in the mind of the narrator."
62,Imagine a God so fucking small and petty that you become his enemy just for not believing in him.
63,Only a sith deals in absolutes.
64,"You see, something has to exat for you tobe an enemy of it, like, zealots exist so therefore i can be an enemy of them, but god is an idea, you cant be the enemy of an idea"
65,I'm an enemy to every God so just maybe they'll kill each other first just to kill me
66,"Dunno. Being a friend to God is a stretch. More like handler.

Binds us to his plan like a dog to a leash."
67,Enemy and fuckin proud bud
68,If God doesn't exist then you can't be an enemy. You are then only a person that someone else needed a reason to hate.
69,I hate the very idea of the nonexistent piece of shit.
70,I am a vehement enemy of many deities... I can criticize them with impunity... it is almost as they are powerless to stop me... it is almost as if they don't exist!
71,One more god rejected!
72,God is a little bitch.
73,"It definitely feels powerful not giving any bit of my mind to a religion, we‚Äôll other than ‚Äúreligion is so brainwashy and creepy‚Äù"
74,"Well, its fun to be the enemy and watch the believers see our existence getting continued despite their prayers of our ""righteous smiting""..."
75,"Fuck you! Im all out of enemies!

Spit it out - Slipknot"
76,"I guess I‚Äôm an enemy. But‚Ä¶the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So God is actually my friend. But, because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy, so actually, God is my enemy."
77,"Only obvious to the oblivious. For the rest of us, there's reality."
78,Oh yes good old flat earth cosmology
79,https://youtu.be/xnu0pqMab9U
80,"I will take the chances of him being real and me going to hell over listening to humans who listen to a book written by humans from years ago. Those same people probably don‚Äôt believe goddesses, gods and monsters exist or have power like their god."
81,"Didn't (s)he want to say ""theology"" instead of ""teleology""? That's a very different thing... üòÖ"
82,We got beef like ramen ain't no meat in that pack slick vegan
83,The kind of evil and horrible suffering various gods have caused throughout history?   I‚Äôm happily an enemy.  Put me down as enemy please.
84,Undure what i am but i know only a sith deals in absolutes....
85,I'm more powerful as your god since I actually exist...
86,Enemy. Fuck that guy
87,Present this so called evidence.
88,All this scientific evidence.  Weird how they can never present it in a logical and compelling manor.
89,Proud enemy of fairytales dictating my life. üëã
90,That guy who give cancer to kids as part of his plan? Yeah fuck him.
91,"I mean we queers DID take the rainbow directly from him, it‚Äôd be kind of awkward just to give it back at this point."
92,"""Obvious scientific and natural evidence""? By whose standards?"
93,Which god though? I don't want to be on Thor's bad side
94,"I'm not afraid of imaginary friends, sorry"
95,"What does an omnipotent, infallible being need with pathetic, irrational, sycophantic humans incessantly campaigning for its existence? The incessant campaigning itself could be interpreted as evidence against such a being. If god wanted me to believe, I would believe."
96,I am neither a friend or enemy to god as much as this person is a friend or enemy to Batman.
97,Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
98,Scientific evidence and gods are mutually exclusive.
99,That‚Äôs as stupid as asking if I‚Äôm a friend or enemy of Spider-Man.
100,Please he made an enemy of us first.
