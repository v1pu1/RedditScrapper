1,Disgusting pedophile freaks who justify their beliefs to harm poor young girls
2,Has this asshole ever met a 9 year old? Holy fuck.
3,Sorry Muslims.   He was a pedophile.   I know a girl who got her period at 7.  He would have raped her then.
4,"He waited until puberty. The thing is, menstruation isn't the end all be all for whether a female is ready to mate. The mortality rate for child pregnancy is ridiculously high because the body is still developing and hips need widening and so on. And just because you menstruated doesn't mean you're ready to take a fully erect penis into yourself without causing permanent internal damage. Muhammad should have known this given that he was supposedly guided by God.

There are also claims that ""thighing"" (rubbing your dick against their thighs) was acceptable and that Muhammad may have done that before she was ready. But I haven't researched into this myself to check for validity because frankly it's disgusting. Wouldn't be surprised at all though."
5,"Mentally.

*Mentally.*

**Mentally.**

Damn do they hear themselves."
6,This is such a fucked up way to think
7,"My niece is 10 year and she is an innocent soul, fuck that pedo and this POS."
8,"I can‚Äôt believe I was one of those type of Muslims. I know i finally saw through the lies, but I still feel guilty for following that bullshit and fighting anyone that disagreed with me."
9,"Mohammad was a disgusting pedophile rapist and murderer. A pathetic foul creature which deserves to ROT. People *defending* this disgusting pseudoprophet need to shut the fuck up.  
Scientificallyyyyyy speakinggggg a 9 year old is a CHILD that hasn't matured mentally, physically, sexually. Sick motherfuckers defending pedophilia and that disgusting excuse of human piece of shit Mohammad."
10,">""age doesnt matter, what matters is that a person has to be mature, sexually, physically, mentally.""

9 year olds are none of the above you fucking dolt"
11,"I checked it up, and girls 9-12 are still children. Moohamad was a pedo."
12,How respectful of him üò°
13,"I am hating this ""puberty means they're adults"" bullshit. Puberty doesn't magically make someone mature, nor does it magically make them capable of being an adult, nor does it magically make them sexual.

Puberty just means the hormones are changing levels which causes some chaos in the body, which effects the neural pathways causing people to be less mature until their bodies have adjusted to the new hormone levels. When puberty begins, it's the worst time to expect them even be capable of rational thought enough to think they're able to marry someone.

So even this excuse is pure and total bullshit, their prophet was a pedophile, plain and simple."
14,"So fuckin gross. I don‚Äôt know how anyone can even say those words without throwing up in their mouth.  

I don‚Äôt have a sister but my best friend‚Äôs sister is 9 soon and uhh‚Ä¶ That ain‚Äôt no mature human"
15,"Things a 9-year old can do:
1) Get married;
2) Have sex;
3) Give birth to and raise kids;
4) Play with dolls.

Things a 9-year old cannot do:
1) Vote;
2) Enter into contracts unless for basic needs;
3) Get a driving license;
4) Get a firearms license."
16,"My kid is just going into Year 4 at school. They are 9. To try and say that anyone is physically, sexually or mentally mature at that age is absolutely laughable. 

Well, it would be laughable if it wasn‚Äôt about having sex with them. That just makes it wilful ignorance defending pedophilia."
17,How can a child mature at 9? At 9 I was still playing with teddy bears and pretending perfume bottles were baby bottles.
18,"Yeah, a 9 years old is definitely mature sexually, physically and mentally. 
I haven't changed since I was 9, I was mature enough. Could have had sex, definitely. / obvious s, have you ever seen a 9 year old ?!"
19,"""Even today...""

... As if kids are supposed to have been hitting puberty *later* in the modern day?

Okay, science lesson time. Meet our *modern* friends the **Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs)!** These are a class of MAN-MADE CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS that we have been using carelessly and washing down our sinks and into the environment, almost entirely within the last 100 years, and they can mimic sex hormones - one of the most common hormones they mimic being b-estradiol, which has a strong feminizing effect. Heaps of industrial chemicals and household cleaners, from nonylphenol (cleaning product) to bisphenol-a (used in plastic production).

This shit takes the role of estrogen in your body. These chemicals are causing men to have lower sperm counts and girls to hit puberty earlier and earlier, *because everyone on Earth is practically microdosing MtF hormone therapy.* It's not even limited to people, EDCs can affect animals too. [Alligator penises are shrinking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7v15TFqm8)

Under-regulated and under-studied chemical runoff has made girls hit puberty *earlier* lately, not, as fruitcake here seems to be implying, later. They were not hitting puberty at 9 years old back in the middle ages. Most of them wouldn't have been hitting puberty at 13. If you fucked a 9 year old 1500 years ago... Yeah, you're a pedo."
20,Didn't start my period till late 14.... the fuck is wrong with these people
21,"What a fascinating argument. Well, here's my retort. \*calls the police\*"
22,Disgusting ass pedophile
23,So sickening.
24,"""sexually, physically and mentally."" 

Ah the number of mentally Mature nine year olds I've met. Remember when you were nine? Weren't you ready for a full fledged relationship with a 50 year old? You could totally connect with one as a mature person couldn't you?"
25,"Contrary to popular belief, girls have been hitting puberty younger, not older as of late. Meaning if anything, she‚Äôs be less likely to have hit it, not more. It‚Äôs also irrelevant, since a 9 year old can‚Äôt consent, she‚Äôs also treated as property, and property can never consent‚Ä¶"
26,There‚Äôs no 9 year old that‚Äôs mature in any of those ways.
27,Eww
28,What an amazing role model.
29,"""She has to be mature, sexually, physically, mentally""

He failed by his own rules. Even *if*  the girl is physically mature at 9, she's still too young to be mentally mature"
30,So it‚Äôs even worse? They consider 9 year olds adults?
31,He still married her when she was 6
32,"These assholes are serious? Mohammed deserves no basic human decency, he deserves cruel and unusual punishment!"
33,where the fuck will you find a girl that is 362880 years old
34,What a guy!
35,He should be fired into the sun. People like that are a danger to society.
36,"9 year olds aren't mentally, physically, sexually or emotionally mature."
37,"Well, Aisha was born fully grown adult, it wasn't uncommon in those days. It took 3 women, 6 days to give birth to her. So she was not 9 but rather 29"
38,"Stop censoring perverts‚Äô usernames

Edit:
I know it‚Äôs a rule we can‚Äôt dox perverts :) wish we could"
39,Holy shit
40,"The average age of puberty has actually been decreasing over time, but ok."
41,"Don't hide his name, he excuses pedophilia (and he's propably one)"
42,tag the creepy fucker
43,All religions deserve equal scrutiny. Even (especially) the one our family told us was true.
44,"Any doctor will tell you that child birth in girls and women under 20, the risk of complications and death skyrockets. This is especially true for those under 15, where girls in that age range have the highest risk of death and complications. This takes into account socioeconomic status, education levels of the family, race and ethnicity, access to healthcare services, pre existing health conditions, etc."
45,Let's hope that they never do.
46,Or has one...
47,Do let him meet 9-year-olds he thinks they're adults o.o
48,You don't have to say sorry
49,"Was this 7 year old being sexually assaulted regularly? It is not normal for a 7 yr old to get her period that young. I‚Äôm sure with rare medical things it might happen but it‚Äôd have to be rare.

50,He was a fucking fraud he never spoke to God he was a liar and a thief first class now millions of people believes his lies
51,Um except he never got her pregnant. Not sure why the prevailing assumption is always led to pregnancy when that isn't even relevant to her case.
52,r/selfawarewolves
53,"""They were mature for their age!""-Pedos at trials justifying their abuse"
54,Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it now-you got out and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. I used to be catholic and getting that poison out of our systems is the best thing. It also spares the next generation.
55,Thank you for changing.
56,"1. I‚Äôm so happy you took the time to reconsider your beliefs and start anew. That‚Äôs not easy and you should be proud of yourself for not falling into the traps of religiosity. We‚Äôre all human and can be very susceptible to terrible ways of thinking, your effort to get out of that is much appreciated.

2. As someone who has never been Muslim but is ex-Catholic, what turned the tides? What did you read, hear, question, or think that slowly melted Islam away? Was it more personally-motivated (i.e. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do ___ even though I‚Äôm told to because it doesn‚Äôt interest me.‚Äù) or morals-based? 

I‚Äôm not trying to psycho-analyse you or anything I just really love learning about how people come to the cusp of losing their religion. What motivated you to leave?

Edit: I‚Äôm part of the LGBT+ community too and that was part of the reason why I began to question things. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your daunting situation, please stay safe I wish all the best for you in the coming year."
57,Mind saying it a little louder for the sick pedo-defending fucks at the back row? Can‚Äôt say ‚Äòmuslim‚Äô because then I‚Äôd be racist.
58,"Yeah, alright, we get it."
59,">9 year olds are none of the above you fucking dolt

Not only did that not get through his thick skull, he also debased himself by saying that sex slaves ""consented"" to sex. The Koran makes sex slavery 100% legal and his excuse was that this sex was ""consensual"". I told him that if a slave's consent was ever taken in to account then the slave could simply say: I do NOT consent to being a slave, BUH-BYE, NOW! 

They'll defend Mohammad no matter how much they have to debase and humiliate themselves. Here's another dolt trying to justify sex slavery in Islam:

https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/vbjmjt/slave\_rape\_is\_required\_to\_live/"
60,"Congratulations, you are officially 69 times more qualified to start a worldwide religion compared to Momopedo!"
61,"So was Aisha, who in her own words were [playing with dolls](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)."
62,"This depraved person didn't even make their usual Aisha was the fastest maturing child in the universe excuse. He straight up gave props to Mohammad for waiting till she was 9 to ~~have sex with her~~ r\*pe her. I've sarcastically lampooned the faster maturing charlatans before:

[Muslim Apologist: Children Matured Faster Back Then | Us: FACEPALM](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/uz2v6n/muslim_apologist_children_matured_faster_back/)"
63,Even 200 years ago girl's average age when they have their first period was around *16!* The idds are extremely high that this girl hadn't had her first period yet.
64,Sorry you had to come across this post on your 11th Cake Day. Sigh.
65,Is this a bit?
66,">/r/religiousfruitcake subreddit rules:  
>  
>3.Names, reddit usernames, subreddit names must be censored on screenshots.

I am following the rules of this subreddit. If they had allowed the usernames to not be censored then I would have had zero interest in censoring the username of a child r\*pe apologist."
67,"That doesn‚Äôt justify still. Puberty aside that is a child who is in primary school, we have rules and ethics, that‚Äôs what separates us from the animals"
68,I don‚Äôt care how young a girl hits puberty or how long ago it was-  a grown ass adult can‚Äôt have sex with a child no matter how mature she is!!!
69,I got my period when I was 12. I was NOT even remotely done maturing mentally or physically. How about we just don‚Äôt try to fuck children? Not even teenagers yet you disgusting pervert.
70,"There are pedophiles everywhere, they just hide out longer in religion because they are supposed to supposedly be a moral standard, so people used to not suspect them. I'm sorry. But if you spout how pure and devout you are on a constant basis, im going to assume you're a sick fuck, pedo or otherwise."
71,"Yeah, just cause a girl can get pregnant doesn't mean she's ready to auctually carry and birth the baby...

Her body is still that of a little girl's, the only guys wanting to be in a relationship with a girl that young are so they can control and manipulate her."
72,Hopefully he never has children.
73,Happy Cake Day!
74,"Usually it's between 8-12, this idiot is wrong, so it's not too far off. I wouldn't rule out rape but it seems very unlikely still."
75,You‚Äôre being downvoted but I do think it is pretty rare. I think it‚Äôs called precocious puberty.
76,First period age has been trending younger over the last hundred years or so. Typically children who start that young are given puberty blockers for a few years because you need that extra mental development to handle it.
77,"There's also like 4'000'000'000 women. Even of it was one in 1000 chance, we're still talking about 4 million women having their period before 8"
78,It happens regularly btw. I've known several girls that have started this young. Don't be an idiot.
79,"They have been more kids developing early due to Hormonal Gel one of the parents is using, I think the common one was Testosterone. A toddler in the UK started growing body hair and had a huge penis for his age because his father was using that Gel. The US has regs on those Gels because of what it does to children but Europe hadn't come around yet."
80,It is not uncommon for a girl to start her period at age 8 or 9.  About 15% start their period by 7.
81,He was like Joseph Smith from the years 1500.
82,"I'll requote a sentence I wrote that has nothing to do with pregnancy so you can read it again:

>And just because you menstruated doesn't mean you're ready to take a fully erect penis into yourself without causing permanent internal damage.

And pregnancy is a side effect of sex. In fact it's like the main reason why creatures have sex in the first place - to breed. Just because Aisha didn't get pregnant (probably because he used up all his sperm having sex with the [other 8 wives](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5068)) doesn't mean it wasn't a risk especially since they didn't use protection and Muhammad was [against coitus interruptus (aka pulling out)](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2229). More against pulling out than sex slavery."
83,"I agree, but its hard not to beat myself up for it when i feel like i hurt people who were just being themselves."
84,"Yeah i began to question my beliefs the more i was told to despise those who didnt do anything to me, as i developed more doubts i decided to explore my sexuality and gender and found myself to be internalizing my transphobia and homophobia, but ive learned accept myself and others. Thank you so much for this, it means so so so much to me. I hope you are having an amazing day or night."
85,"Ahh yes of course, when they run out of arguments they resort to ""oh u racist, oh u islamophobic"". They are that dumb that they never realize that's not even about race, muslims are not a race. The argument is about how rotten this religion is. How filthy rotten their pseudo prophet muhammad is. I never see any Christian screaming ""Christianphobe"". It's only fucking muslims screaming ""islamophobe""."
86,Do you get it?
87,lmao my guy‚Äôs advertising his other posts in the comments like he makes a living off them
88,What?
89,"I know you are, I just wish it wasn‚Äôt a rule :) these are the fucks worth doxxing"
90,You missed the point of what I was saying. But so apparently did a lot of people.
91,"Of course. I'm pointing out that even the ""facts "" in the initial statement are incorrect."
92,Ok so I was just pointing out that saying puberty hit between 9-12 back then would be absolutely incorrect. It was closer to 16 even 100 years ago. I wasn't arguing for sleeping with children. But you guys take it as you will.
93,"since 1940 216000 claims of sexual Assault were reported against the Catholics church, it is truly everywhere."
94,Me who got them at 15
95,"I was meaning more towards touching. Repeatedly touching can stimulate sex hormones which can cause early puberty for both girl and boys. I probably could have worded my comment better but it was late. People can downvote me but you‚Äôd be surprised at how much more common sexual assault is than what the average person thinks and little kids are less likely to speak up about it cause many are taught not too or that it‚Äôs normal. And thank you, I hope I am wrong.

Edit: here is one study. 
https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/11/sex-abuse-triggers-early-puberty-and-its-problems"
96,"It's pretty rare, but being ""sexually assaulted regularly"" is not a prerogative."
97,I saw a source that said 7% start 7 or earlier.  I just know that it happened to a friend of my daughter when they were 7.  This is 23 years ago.
98,"I‚Äôm not being an idiot, thanks. Still a small percent."
99,"I believe you. It is a shock, to me that is still young but I have known a few who have started at 9 and know that‚Äôs not uncommon. I‚Äôm sorry my original comment came off harsh. Was not my intent. I should have waited and worded it differently and had sources."
100,Reach out to folks you might‚Äôve hurt and apologize. Unless you‚Äôre going to get attacked as a heretic.
