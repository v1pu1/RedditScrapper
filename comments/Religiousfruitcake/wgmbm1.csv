1,"Christians, wrong for 2000 years, yet super-confident.

Jesus told his followers he would be back.  If they all died of old age first, then he didn't ""go back"" to them.  The Second Coming was always within the lifetime of the witnesses.  Which is proof against Jesus, not proof it will be happening soon."
2,"80 generations of promises.

Maybe it's because Jesus never existed?"
3,"I see him every day next door. Nice dude, makes good burritos."
4,Shouldn't this guy be naked?
5,"It was also imminent forty-odd years ago when our local Anglican Church was on a free-movie-night-for-teens kick and showing classics like “A Thief in the Night” and “A Distant Thunder”.  And yet, here we are."
6,"If they really believed this bullshit, why the hell are they buying bonus buckets? Don’t they think they’re going to be raptured away before all the bad shit happens?"
7,"What would they do if Middle-Eastern Yeshua returned, and then started preaching his socialist teachings?"
8,Jimmy Carr - what the fuck am i supposed to do with imminent?!
9,"Lol. Been saying that for close to 2,000 years now. And literally every single generation of Christians thought they were going to see Jesus again."
10,Cool. Could he hurry a lil bit? I hate my job atm so he would do me a huge favour to end the world
11,This time for sure! 2000th time is the charm. No way does it just not happen again
12,Imminent since 30 AD.
13,"That's just Larry, he randomly ascends sometimes but we don't like to talk about it"
14,"r/WritingPrompts 

Rapture happens, no real Christians left and Jesus decides to get a job at Subway since his great plan failed."
15,I wish the rapture WOULD happen so the rest of us can get on with progress.
16,"Fuck this shit dude, the rapture caused me so much anxiety when I was younger"
17,"...says every generation for the last 2,000 years."
18,Can someone please explain what a rapture is
19,"They wish. You’re stuck with us, get over it"
20,Anybody else see this and immediate wonder if a laser fired from space is about to make a shit-ton of popcorn?
21,Bro got folded by Vecna
22,Is the man in the picture letting out one big invisible nut?
23,Wait til someone tells them the rapture isn’t in the Bible.
24,"I'm waiting for another ""great disappointment"" to occur. I would love to see the looks on their faces when the world once again doesn't end when they say it will."
25,Here we go again.
26,But its habbening for reals this time....
27,"I am willing to argue that Jesus might have been a real person, obviously deified and had many continuous parables written about him, but he said he'd be back after 30 years iirc, and last I checked we're nearing the 2 millennium mark."
28,And the only person who knows how to make my sprinkler work every spring
29,"Nah, Jesus thought he was dripped out. Wanted to save the outfit too."
30,"Kinda like when Y2K was coming, Christians bought boxes and boxes and boxes of food supply."
31,Uhhh. . . : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRUcIIMy1ko
32,"Originally: a feeling of intense pleasure or joy.

In the context of Christianity (especially modern North American Evangelical Christianity): The event where Jesus returns and whisks his True Believers off to heaven and leaves the unsaved, false believers, and sinners to suffer on Earth through the tribulations ~~plagiarized from existing eschatology (end times writings)~~ foretold in the Book of Revelations."
