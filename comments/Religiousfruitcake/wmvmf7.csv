1,"""A man who writes novels is like a terrorist who murdered thousands of people"" to them, yes, but much much worse. His books helped people to see truth, and move away from their religion. I am sure countless 1000's left because of his writings. And rightfully so. But to muslims, and most other religions, that is a horrible crime. To them, this man committed two huge wrongs here. First, he stopped all these people from being allowed in to heaven. Condemed them to hell, far worse then simply killing someone. And two, he showed them the weakness of their religion. If mere human words can sway people, what's that say about God's supposed words? It weakens their religion. So yeah, to the most devout, he would be seen as far worse then a mass murderer."
2,The only people to be harmed by Rushdie's book have been at the hands of his opponents
3,"The only book that matters is the Quran. All other books should be burned.

/s"
4,Today's horrible events aside. I find it hilarious that absolutely nobody knew what Rushdie looked like until he went into hiding.
5,For Muslims they would burn the whole earth for their beloved lovely prophet
6,If your religion doesn't like criticism to the point of doing murders then maybe it's time to question if it's religion of peace or no :)
7,The faith in Islam is literally a door hanging off a hinge that's somehow hanging off one loose screw.
8,Thats one big freggin fire.
9,"Of all the Muslims I have known, none of them would celebrate their birthdays or listen to music. Many of them wouldn't read any other book, outside of school."
10,I had not heard of muslims not celebrating birthdays on principle
11,Why would you not listen to ANY music at all?
12,"Music at the time Quran written mostly used to sing polytheist stories and this usage condemned in Quran. And because Quran considered as literal word of God and unchangeable so much religous people still don't listen music

But there are, among men, those who purchase idle tales, without knowledge (or meaning), to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule (on the Path): for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty.

Do ye then wonder at this recital? And will ye laugh and not weep,- Wasting your time in vanities?"
