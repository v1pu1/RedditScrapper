1,Is this part of some weird Aslan x Voldemort fanfic?
2,So Voldemort is horrified at walking in on a girl sucking off a lion head?
3,As it is all in her head?
4,Was this made by someone in narnia?
5,All I could think of with the huge lion head is those commercials for MGM Casino Sports Betting. This picture is Voldemort being forced to pay his gambling debts after betting on Quidditch.
6,It looks like a cadaverous Dr Evil.
7,Damn what happaned to Voldemorts robes? Poor guy fell on hard times ig
8,These people are so arrogant they think they're important enough for gods to get all worked up over.
9,Praying makes Hoarah Loux scare away skeletons. Very common knowledge of course.
10,With the power of prayer you too can be the weirdo who brings down the vibes at the furry/undead rave.
11,What’s 2nd edition Vecna doing there?
12,It's either voldemort or one of the strigoi from the strain.
13,I don't know he's got some pretty long fingers.....
14,I don't know he's got some pretty long fingers.....
