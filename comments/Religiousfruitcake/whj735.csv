1,Speaking of minds being wiped and altered. . . üôÑ
2,"Hilariously, that's pretty close to my beliefs as an atheist: I'm gonna be dead. I won't remember anything. Someone can put in their wishes that they wanna be buried, but they're dead - they're not gonna know if someone doesn't abide by their wishes."
3,"‚ÄúGod gave us free will because he didn‚Äôt want us to be robots he wanted us to love him willingly‚Äù 
Just for us to end up robots Anyway? Yeah okay"
4,"Anyone care to cite a Bible verse for that? I've heard Christians say that but it seems more like an attempt to rationalize away the obvious. It's also a very evil way for God to ""solve"" a problem.

I don't think the Bible says this, but I could be wrong."
5,"Ok cool, might as well just be dead then"
6,So what‚Äôs the point of being alive?
7,"Yeah, I heard this in church right after my grandmother, who I adored, had passed away. I did not take it well.

What's the point of being eternally happy in Heaven if you don't remember or care about your Earthly family and relationships? I'm pretty sure that's what started my spiral into atheism."
8,"This would be the exact same thing as ceasing to exist. Everything that is ""us"" is our memories and emotions ."
9,I love how religious people have so much confidence to just pull shit out of their ass.
10,The final brain wash
11,"Then what's the point?

You're not going to heaven, your cells are."
12,"I hope this is satire. It's one of the best examples of why ad hoc arguments are just bad.

Seriously. WTF goes on in the mind of a person that thinks this is a good argument?"
13,"A friend of mine who wasn't religious told me he thought when we die, we find out we were all the same entiti in different forms so we could experience all the things like hate, love, luck, etcetera

I really liked it tbh. That we could be all be one"
14,"No free will. No choice. 

Welcome to the borg.  Let‚Äôs plug you in."
15,"So then I won‚Äôt be in heaven, if a fundamental part of my identity changes then I would not be in heaven, a husk of what I was would be in heaven"
16,"Mm sounds like fun

This is exactly one of the points that made me backtrack a bit when my parents were tying to brainwash me ask a kid 

They were like, something along the lines of ‚ÄúNot only will you not be sad about your earth memories while in heaven, you won‚Äôt even have those troubling memories!‚Äù

Hugely problematic since we are made by our memories, our experiences, erasing those would effectively make us different people, no? So add that to the list of things an actual ‚Äúloving god‚Äù would never do to you lol"
17,![gif](giphy|3oEjI789af0AVurF60)
18,"My mind will be wiped and altered? Then ""I"" will no longer exist. Something else with new memories and traits will be given my name."
19,"Actually? This is in line with Chinese myth, where souls drink a broth that wipes their memories after death. The difference is that they are then sent back to Earth and reincarnated as a new person, not spending the rest of eternity sitting at the feet of a deity and singing his praises. Plus, if you told these fruitcakes their beliefs had anything to do with Taoism, they‚Äôd start screaming, ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU COMPARE US TO A SATANIC FALSE RELIGION?‚Äù"
20,"IF you have a BRAIN that is capable of generating ""mind"" and memory stuff to begin with"
21,Then why should I care about getting there if it‚Äôs not me who will get there?
22,"""Free Will"" my ass"
23,So what's the point of heaven?
24,Then what's the point?
25,"""Brainwashing is a good thing actually."""
26,"I can exactly guess which post this comment is from.

Seriously the amount of over-religious redditors has skyrocketed since that post"
27,Where in the hell in the scripture does it say bullshit like this. Anybody have any idea?
28,It's telling that their highest goal is to become brainwashed.
29,"So none of this fucking matters, but god will still punish you for eternity?"
30,Sounds great.
31,"So...Kyrians, huh?"
32,Sounds like a plot from hollywood alien abduction movie
33,I was told this in church when I was younger and literally panicked because I was scared that once I die everyone that I loved and cared about wouldn‚Äôt remember me and I wouldn‚Äôt remember them. If that‚Äôs heaven then I don‚Äôt want to be there. That along with many other things is why I stopped believing and started questioning because what the actual fuck
34,I don't want to go there then.
35,"When I was like 5 and raised religious, I always thought of this and it made me cry to think I wouldn't remember my parents or my friends lol
PTSD flashbacks."
36,Sounds like some psycho-thriller horror movie where you're stuck in a perfect place but don't know you're being deluded.
37,and that‚Äôs a good thing?
38,"Can someone honestly explain in detail what heaven is? I have never gotten a detailed answer. Where is it? What happens in-between dying and getting there, god is going to meet me and judge me? Do I get a chance to speak? Do I go there first for judgement and then hell? Who is in heaven and what does it look like? If it is truly my idea of heaven then why is so much sin allowed there because my heaven is filled with tons of things that would be considered sin. Is it my own heaven? Do I get to visit other peoples heavens?

If you want to give my life up for heaven you gotta clear some things up first."
39,This just makes me want to go to Heaven even less
40,Well that sounds like hell to me
41,Wow! Thank the gods!
42,Oh that‚Äôs not horrifying /s
43,Who makes this shit up?
44,That person is doing something they‚Äôre not supposed to
45,Then what the fuck is the point of life on earth?
46,"I think it‚Äôs baffling like that‚Äôs a good thing. Like, my life hasn‚Äôt exactly been great, but I‚Äôve met so many great people, and have had good experiences with them and on my own. I‚Äôd sooner burn in the lake of fire and have those memories than live in paradise without them."
47,"Dude, wipe and alter this!"
48,So reincarnation basically?
49,"Ok, the Bible may convince a lot of people, especially the young and trusting, but now you‚Äôre just lazily filling in the gaps. Look, anything having to do with the body is done after death. That‚Äôs a fact because your body is here and that has been thoroughly studied. That means hot, cold, pain, gravity, atmosphere, or anything that is a function of our senses is out. So if you want to invent something called a soul because you can‚Äôt comprehend nothingness, then at least be imaginative. Now you‚Äôre in a corner. For your story to work we need to become some sort of sentient energy being which doesn‚Äôt need a brain to sense all the things described in Heaven and Hell. How about a sentient fart? That would help explain why a dead body stinks. Plus it suits a lot of Christians. I think I‚Äôm on to something. You die and become a fart that ascends to the heavens and floats around destroying ozone for eternity. And that is Heaven to you because the libs hate when you fuck up the environment."
50,I‚Äôd like to know which verse in the Bible backs up this theory of theirs
51,"i would like to keep the memories of the ones i love, the memories of everything ive ever did in my life, thank you"
52,Either heaven is an ARG or heaven just straight up sucks ass
53,this sub is stupid
54,"To the point where reality has been replaced by bad, stupid, nonsensical fiction.  

This doesn't make any sense.  Religious people just throw religious shit at the wall in an attempt to see what sticks.  That means, if it's popular, they keep it.  Then they believe in it holeheartedly, otherwise it just gets discarded.  

These people DO NOT have it together.  They're throwing out random garbage as their main source of ""spiritualism"".   Not only completely useless, but harmful."
55,having your mind wiped is essentially dying
56,"It's also an explanation for how heaven can be heaven.

""OK, so I'm going to live *forever* up there in paradise... but I'm a finite entity. I have finite abilities. There's only a finite number of wonderful happy things I can do in heaven before I've done all of them a thousand times and am jaded and bored. So I guess God's just going to erase my memory so I can do all of that stuff again, huh? Or will He allow me to transcend my finite limits, by making me into a thing like Him? But that sounds an awful lot like what the Serpent promised Eve...!""

(My /r/im14andthisisdeep thing I've occasionally said to dumbass religious people is, ""Heaven is where God shares His terrible torture with the creatures He created for this purpose. God can do absolutely anything... except die."")"
57,"Love him willingly, or else!!"
58,you ain't wrong
59,I think i saw where this post was from? They were talking very much about how *their* interpretation of heaven was in order to work with the context of a comic in which only a single member of a family reaches heaven
60,"May as well be dead, or go to hell if I still remember em there. Satan is probably a absaute bro anyway. You should speedrun getting the most sins!"
61,That‚Äôs my thought if you don‚Äôt get to maintain knowledge and relationships. What‚Äôs the point!!
62,jesus h croissants that username
63,With the Final Countdown soundtrack
64,"That's kind of terrifying though because it means there's only one being in the universe üòÇ

But maybe creating reality and ""forgetting"" is the Omni being's way of not being lonely? ü§î"
65,That sounds very lovecraftian
66,"Wasn't that the idea of the video titled ""the egg"" from kurgusat or whatever that channel name was?"
67,"oh cool your friend has read ""the egg""  by andy weir.

https://youtu.be/h6fcK\_fRYaI"
68,"That's a common feeling people experience while on psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin or DMT."
69,That is an established religious idea. That people are all part of a universal Oversoul.
70,"That can‚Äôt possibly be accurate. Because there‚Äôs no way that I‚Äôm a bigoted, women‚Äôs right hating, pro-birth asshole."
71,"This is basically the (very) short story, [""The Egg"".](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html)

(A couple of people have failed to link to a YouTube reading of that story, and a couple have succeeded. :-)"
72,i think they call that the cosmic egg theory eventually it matures and all it's splintered lives merge into a God among many Gods
73,"does he think we are every living organism too? like plants, animals, fungi, bacteria...

what about viruses that are at the limit between what's alive and what's not?

what if we are just every thing? living and non-living?"
74,"but that also means that we are all murderers, rapists, pedophiles, etc."
75,"There's a similar thing in Greek myth too, I think. Except souls bathe in a river (I believe) that wipes their memories and leaves them as just a wraith. I think there's also some reincarnation possibilities in Greek myth too but don't quote me there."
76,"Yep, aside from the gaslighting Mormon Heaven described in ""Saving Alex"", I mainly thought of the passage in the Divine Panorama about the souls, once purified, being forced to drink the forgetfulness elixir before being sent back to be reincarnated."
77,"If you have that, go straight to hell"
78,But on the other hand will your empty husk walk around for an eternity
79,Nachos
80,Taco Tuesday
81,It was pure insanity
82,"Sorry dude
I was horrified too

His responses did not make it better"
83,Truman Show
84,Crazy people
85,But without Taco Tuesday
86,Why?
87,This is why religious people are god fearing and not god loving
88,"I'd rather be myself, flaws and all, and be in hell than be a holy robot and in heaven."
89,"There is no point. And that‚Äôs why since I‚Äôm already here, might as well explore this thing called life and live it out because this is my only chance until I go back to nothingness."
90,as sung by a biblically accurate angel telekinetically shredding on an electric guitar
91,"I love these contemplations. I won't make a religion about it, but I love to ponder"
92,https://youtu.be/h6fcK\_fRYaI
93,"that would mean that we *are* reality

but I don't think it's true as I believe consciousness to be simply the result of the thinking process in our brains, it's not a thing, but an event if you ask me

I think once we die the process in our brains stops and consciousness stops with it, it doesn't go anywhere, it just stops being enacted

the idea is still interesting tho"
94,https://youtu.be/h6fcK\_fRYaI
95,"Yes that was exactly what I thought about.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) it is."
96,"""This video is not available"" 

[This one works](https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI)

Nice story!"
97,The idea has been around for a long time. Couple hundred years ago they called it the Oversoul
98,"The Egg is plagiarized, Andy lied. In 2007 I posted the essay [Infinite Reincarnation](https://charmonium.com/infinite-reincarnation) to the MySpace religion and philosophy forum. Andy commented on the post and asked me questions about my beliefs in pantheism and reincarnation. He took my responses and parts of the essay and turned it into The Egg."
99,"you are what you were raised to be, it's just culture being culture"
100,"You are right, the Lethe have this purpose, but there's no consensus about to whom it is available (either everybody not eternally in tartarus or only the Chosens in Elysium when they get bored and wish to start over) but reincarnation is always a given.

Going with the Second possibility you have along with it the less known Asphodeles Fields, where average people end up, as empty husks if I remember correctly."
