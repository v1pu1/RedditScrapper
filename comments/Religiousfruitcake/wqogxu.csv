1,"Victim blaming is still prominent in India, especially in the conservative areas."
2,I'm gonna go back to believing mankind when victim blaming ceases to exist.
3,Indian courts are a fucking joke. Its literally just a nepotism hall.
4,"While the judgement is a travesty, OP just want to malign Kerala. Kerala is one of the few remaining states in India where Hindus, Christians and Muslims live harmoniously. OP is a hindu extremist and have an intense hatred for minorities (Christians and Muslims in particular). Just yesterday Hindu extremists had drafted a constitution for a Hindu nation where minorities cannot vote."
5,"(read in the voice of that narrator from *SpongeBob SquarePants*)  
10 billion years later"
6,"Yeah ,it needs a massive makeover in its system as it's till stuck in colonial era system"
7,What part of the post maligns Kerala exactly? OP literally states it as the most progressive state in India.
8,I guess they mean that kerala itself is the most progressive state so that says a lot about the country as a whole?
9,"Mate leave it. That's reddit for you.

I just saw an account that's been spamming the other subreddits about the mistreatment of muslims. While some of the cases are indeed true it doesn't take somebody smart to understand that they are posting with a biased intent."
