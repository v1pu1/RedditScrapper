1,If churches close down because they have to pay taxes then they were never using their funds correctly. Just like employers that bitch about having to pay their employees a living wage bankrupting them - you didn‚Äôt deserve to run a business if you can‚Äôt pay your people. Same goes for churches. You don‚Äôt deserve to exist if you aren‚Äôt doing what you say you do (helping communities) by paying taxes.
2,"What cracks me up about the whole anti woke movement is that they can‚Äôt even agree on what exactly wokeness is trying to accomplish. I highly doubt this is it, though."
3,Taxing churches sounds like a great idea to me...
4,Didn't they obliquely admit that their churches are committing tax fraud?
5,"Always playing the victim. However, if they did tax all these churches practicing politics, it would make me so happy. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt happen near often enough."
6,r/persecutionfetish
7,Only a massive influx of cash from your pocket to ours can help.
8,A bit of /r/selfawarewolves here too. The only churches the irs is gonna care about are those that are breaking the law.
9,Oh my God! Seriously? Then count me in me right away!... _to help Biden and Pelosi to achieve this more faster._
10,I would be so happy if they taxed churches before I die.
11,Was this from a Republican candidate begging for donations? It certainly sounds like more Republican fear mongering.
12,Stay out of government and government will stay out of your make believe super powered creators bullsh**t
13,"Give unto Caesar what is Caesar‚Äôs 

That‚Äôs in the Bible. So pay up."
14,If this ain‚Äôt fear mongering then I don‚Äôt know what is
15,I like to think Debbie has superpowers and is going to fight off 87000 feds singlehandedly.
16,Biden is in a church more often than Trump.
17,"Honestly if I were Christian I wouldn't be intimidated so easily even if this bullshit were real.

Get ten people together in a house and talk about Jesus and it's a Church. It's not like the Bible says you need the steeple and all that shit, just meet and pray together.

Of course this is all bullshit and Biden himself is also Christian."
18,Bankrupt churches.....if they were doing what they have supposed to be doing with their tax free money all that should happen is charities close down. If the churches themselves cant even stay open being taxed it is clear sign that they have NOT been doing community outreach but instead going to town living above their means buying every new tech they can to coerce a larger crowd. Religions are 100% businesses and they shoukd be treated like so
19,Aren't they just taking away the tax-exempt status of those churches who get involved in politics?  Like the law already says.
20,"There's a Christian church, sometimes two, in nearly every strip mall in this country...yes, indeed, yall are under attack. 

Fucking weirdos with their very specific fetish."
21,"One massive response **CAN** stop the IRS from shutting down a Church's 501(c) tax exemption, and it's called:

**NOT BREAKING THE LAW!!**"
22,"It‚Äôs all come down to this, Debbie."
23,geez I wish it were only minutes away
24,Debbie.
25,Not sure  what believing in god has to do with fraudulent churches.
26,It‚Äôs a bunch of crap but l‚Äôm all for it bring them down
27,"‚ÄúMinutes away from winning‚Äù you say!?! Got ‚Äòem on the run folks!  Cry 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war!!!"
28,Persecution complex on full throttle still.
29,As they damn well should‚Ä¶
30,Gee pretty sure that the fact that churches can‚Äôt be taxed and it is settled law‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..wait a mi Ute wasn‚Äôt Roe settled law‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.hmmmm maybe churches that don‚Äôt act as a charitable organization and rather act a a political advocacy group should be taxed‚Ä¶just sayin fair is fair
31,"If I had even .01% of the power these people think the nonreligious do, I could literally attack and dethrone God"
32,I wish they would go after the churches. Fat chance though.
33,">bankrupt every church in America

Do not threaten me with a good time...

Oh, and please do the catholic church, next."
34,"So many words for, ""I'm afraid of churches being taxed"""
35,Pretty safe bet those agents won‚Äôt go after many churches
36,If only she was correct.
37,One can dream
38,What can I do to help hasten the demise?
39,"Tax the churches , income and property,  until they piss blood."
40,I wish churches would shut down. Only in our dreams I guess. Hopefully one day we‚Äôll progress enough to have a world of atheists that believe in physical evidence instead of imaginary beings.
41,I wish
42,For them it's more setting up a one religion world.
43,I fucking wish
44,"I don't think it'll ever happen, but honestly it would be great if churches got taxed.

I don't get a tax free social club for my random interests.

If they want to claim it's because they do charity let them deduct the actual charity they do and nothing else."
45,"Oh no, minutes away! Did Debbie save us or was Christianity defeated last night? I have the news on they didn‚Äôt mention it."
46,"For so many words they're awfully light on explaining how they think this will happen. Right now their conspiracy theory seems to be:

1. Government hires 87,000 new IRS agents
2. ???
3. ???
4. ???
5. Every Church in America instantly bankrupted

> The woke mob is just minutes away from winning their war on Christianity in America

Just minutes, huh? How long ago was this posted? Like should I be getting ready to go to a woke mob victory parade or something?"
47,SCOTUS just revoked the right to abortion yet Christian‚Äôs are still the most persecuted demographic? üßê
48,Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are both Christians themselves. Why would they fight a ‚Äúwar on Christianity?‚Äù
49,I cant even find the front lines in the war on christianity.  Where the hell is it and how the hell do I enlist ?
50,"And will they change their minds when this later proves to be untrue? No, they will just carry on as if it actually happened. This is your brain on faith."
51,"This is hilarious, in that both Pelosi and Biden are Catholic and regularly attend Mass, while Donald Trump had not been a member of a church for 37 years and, as evidenced by his statements, an unrepentant sinner.  President Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better plan does block churches (all churches, not just Christian churches) from using the funds to build new buildings that are specifically for worship or make improvements on those buildings.  They can use the funds for facilities geared toward child care or education.  Therefore, there is less evidence of the Biden Administration ‚Äòbankrupting‚Äô churches than there was of the Trump Administration trying to eliminate all churches except the evangelical churches, which tend to preach hatred, bigotry, and exclusion in direct contrast to Jesus‚Äô message of love, acceptance, and inclusion."
52,"As a church member of a church who shared a pastor with another church (on a charge), has a budget of 44K including 20K for help keeping up our food boxes, underwear distributions, thanksgiving meal services, fan box distribution, winter school supply restock, and who are only able to operate thanks to grants and non church members giving , etc‚Ä¶we are 100% fine with this.

It‚Äôs all y‚Äôall buying your preachers new office furniture for 10K, with pastors with planes, churches that do mission trips to other countries which you only do a Bible school like trip, etc, that need to worry."
53,Good.
54,Even if it‚Äôs a bot I always reply to my spam texts. I‚Äôd would ask this one how I can help the IRS.
55,"Gee, its almost like they are aware of their own corruption. They know they can‚Äôt survive IRS scrutiny."
56,good tax those hypocrits into submission
57,"We did it boys, we stopped Christianity"
58,"Is that real, is USA actually taxing the churches?"
59,Debbie do something!!!!!!
60,"I don't know if you're name is really Debbie, but considering this is probably a copy and paste message, I think it would be really funny if your name was something else"
61,"The 87,000 IRS agents of Joe Biden"
62,"If only.

Just the ones that touch, however remotely, on politics."
63,"If churches can't stay afloat then that's entirely on them. They should have never evaded taxes in the first place. What absolute abuse.

Additionally, they shouldn't have been backing the conservative right, then. The one side hell bent on solidifying capitalism (and therefore self provisioned expenses) into eternity. Maybe if they backed the progressive left they could *possibly* leverage a deal to be payed for by taxes. Work on organizing means of putting money to better use than hoarding and expansions/revisions of their building.

Take what I say with a side of salt, I'm far from an economist."
64,"Churches should have to pay taxes but be able to write off any of their *actual* charitable work.  No more tax free private jets and mega mansions.  Oh and the mormon church is just a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, TAX THEM."
65,You win the internet today. It's just an excuse for being a failure.
66,"You know, I‚Äôm nothing of an economist myself"
67,"Wokeness is everything that is against god, guns and gender!"
68,"Wokeness is what ruins my life, fragile identity, and broken destructive traditions!!"
69,"If they taxed them where I live, we could finally become a more typical and developed European nation. These bearded fucks have been hoarding the money for centuries. Lots of that is blood money I'm 100% sure of that. Not to mention how much they have been illegaly building without even buying that plot of land and usurping our Nations territory like it's their playground

I say tax them, make them pay reparations for all the illegal shit they did and send many of the priests to Hague to answer about their war crime activities."
70,Churches were all a tax fraud from the fucking beginning. I *wish* this was all about stopping the churches. Fuck every one of them.
71,"Yeh, I posted it there first."
72,That would be... MOST OF THEM!
73,It is. Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are both Christians themselves. Why would they fight a ‚Äúwar on Christianity?‚Äù
74,"Your church is doing precisely what *all* churches are supposed to be doing with their money, and, as you said, if churches were taxes, yours probably wouldn't be adversely effected at all. I've long maintained that churches could be taxed in a way similar to the way businesses are, where all monies used to their specified purpose would be tax exempt, thus churches wouldn't pay taxes anyway. But the ONE THING that all churches should be held accountable for is NOT promoting any specific political person, party or ideology. 

There's a valid reason the US's Founding Fathers created a wall of separation between church and state. IMHO, all churches who violate that should be put out of business."
75,"Nobody is talking about taxing churches that are actually churches. I grew up Catholic and my parents were founding members of the parish where we went from holding mass in movie theaters in the 1970s until they raised enough money to build and finance a physical building in the early 1980s. I married my husband in that same church and I am only saying this so u understand that I am not anti religion. 
What I am against is these mega churches that are nothing more than fund raising machines whose ‚Äúpastors‚Äù are multi millionaires who live so far beyond the means of their parishioners that it is criminal."
76,"I‚Äôm pretty sure most people who want churches taxed are mostly talking about the mega church, prosperity gospel scammers and/or the actual holdings of massive churches with a central hierarchy and a history of abuse.

You could try to tax churches like the one I grew up in, or the one you describe, but you can‚Äôt get blood from a stone. Tiny churches with tiny memberships aren‚Äôt the real targets, I don‚Äôt think, anyone except the ‚Äútax every religious institution regardless of wealth or history‚Äù group would want that."
77,It's a very BTAS Joker situation for them. They'll screw around with everyone else but they know they'll be screwed into the ground if they screw with the IRS.
78,I've gotten this message. My name is not Debbie
79,"Absolutely, if they can‚Äôt afford to stay open maybe their leadership should make less money? Going into religious service (and public service like politics) shouldn‚Äôt be a way to get rich. Certainly not megarich like Joel osteen types"
80,"‚ÄúDo you love your guns, god, and government??? *FUCK YEAH!*‚Äù

- Marilyn Manson, ‚ÄúLove Song‚Äù (2000)"
81,Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are both Christians themselves. Why would they fight a ‚Äúwar on Christianity?‚Äù
82,Don't forget logic and reason.
83,"It ruins the freedom of speech! I can‚Äôt use slurs to refer to LGBTQABDEFG ü§¨ and I can‚Äôt be racist üò°üò°üò° HOW DARE THEY MAKE MY ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES! How dare they teach my kids TO RESPECT MINORITIES üò°üò°üò°

/s but I think it‚Äôs obvious"
84,"I would truly enjoy seeing them pay for the horrible shit done to people because, GAWWWD."
85,Ah okay. I see that now. Have a nice day.
86,"I agree but there are some backwoods churches with about a hundred members.   
 They preach politics from the pulpit every week.  They do nothing but try  add numbers to the baptism list and then don't actually do anything for anyone else.  They hate everyone else using the Bible as their excuse.  

The IRS can go for them too."
87,"The question that really should be asked is how should churches adapt? If they can't, oh well. But maybe they should lower expenses, or require admissions, cruel as it may sound, that happens with so many other things in this world. (Things that people don't even blink at)

Either work ALONGSIDE the government to keep giving your followers free subscriptions, or continue in your petty ways and accept that you must fine just like any other organization and or business."
88,I was thinking of the same thing lmao!
89,"It says women have rights, that women are anything better than dirt!! That I'M a TOXIC MASCULINITY!!!"
90,"I mean, if religious institutions here in Balkans had to accordingly to their intererferance in the crimes and their financial strength pay for it together, we would improve our society, pay lots of debts, and the churches and mosques would still be financially ok

This isn't meant to shit on a specific religion, they all did the same shit for their own benefits"
