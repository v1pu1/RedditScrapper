2,"There is something very gay about men trying to emphasise activities that supposedly make them manly. Makes me think that they're not quite secure about their masculinity and that they feel a need to engage in particular activities inorder to attain and maintain it. 

What exactly would this guy say If he came across a fellow manly man with a muscle car and a huge collection of guns and hunting-trophies, who however thought that bow-hunting sucks?

Has someone told him that Jesus probably never went bow-hunting (or hunting at all, for that matter)? If anything he would probably find it immature and unworthy for a grown man to use a weapon that is demonstrably less accurate than a rifle and more likely to cause uneccesary pain and suffering in an animal on account of this, just so he can roleplay as Robin Hood or John Rambo."

5,"I read: ""Real men love Jesus, shoot it straight""

Whatever floats your boat mate, I won't promise you hell for your kinks..."

8,"Either promoting straight sexuality, or maybe referencing a greek archery-associated hypernym for sain in contrast to sin (Tunkhano/Tychain as opposed to Hanartano/Hamartia).

Hamartia is missing the mark while Tychain is hitting the target (Tragic Flaws vs Tonic Flexes).
