1,">hard labor/work camp until they had a spiritual epiphany

Arbeit Macht Frei, huh?

The concentration camps didn’t start explicitly as extermination centers. They started pretty much exactly as described here, with abuses escalating over time. Those who were sent to them were dehumanized and demonized to the point that people on the outside were devoid of sympathy when the deaths started."
2,"""Degenerate"" continues to be a dogwhistle. 

Though in this case it's more of a foghorn"
3,"There is no difference between the brutality of christianity and Islam. History of christianity has proven this. The only thing keep christianity in check in Western nations is the muzzle and chain of secular democracy. Remove that, and we're back to the christian world of bloody crusades, Inquisitions, reformations and traditional biblical christian family values of genocide, slavery, oppressive subjugation of women, and the execution of scientists, non conformists and gays in the name of Jesus."
4,Theocracy only looks good to religidiots if it’s their religion in charge.
5,Slavery for non believers? That sounds awfully nazi of you
6,There was another guy who wanted people he didnt like in camps too
7,"If Christian Extremism was this:

Sell all your possessions and dedicate your life to helping the poor.

Nobody would have a problem with that. Too bad they want the opposite. They want to kill nonbelievers and steal their belongings."
8,"Oh they'll have an epiphany for sure. Something along the line of ""these Christians are prideful and self-centered assholes"""
9,What a fucking monster
10,"The Pol Pot School of ""re-education""."
11,"No no, not kill, just work camps."
12,My spiritual epiphany in that situation would be becoming a terrorist
13,Bring back the lions.
14,Spiritual Epiphany 👍🏻
15,Push them until they experience despair to the extent that they take up religion...
16,"“i’d only torture them to believe, im the good guy”"
17,"So torture people until they give in to your beliefs.

Edit: a word."
18,Oh yeah.....Bring back slavery and labor camps baby. Um ummm ummm ummm....cums
19,"Bring it, cowboy."
20,Oh way down south in the land of traitors!
21,Love to hate a Nat-C
22,Me and my fellow satanists disagree. But we also double dog dare you to fucking try
23,I kinda agree that 99% people on Reddit need to experience hard labour for at least a year.
24,"Most concentration camps throughout history (and to this day, because they still exist - including in the US and Europe) weren't death camps. Some aren't even technically labor camps. 

Officially, they're branded as detention centers, prisons, reeducation facilities and even refugee camps. In practice, all of them are horrific places that violate every human right imaginable and have never given anyone any epiphany other than ""Wow, the people who put me here are monsters""."
25,"I could be wrong, but I believe at least in the case of the Nazis, the concentration camps were always meant to be extermination centers. But a lot of people didn't actually know that. A large portion of the population thought they were ""harmless"" re-education camps or something like that."
26,"I say-I say-I say that's degeneracy, son, it went right by ya!"
27,Precisely.
28,"Nail, meet head."
29,"Yep, the only reason Islam seems so bad is because they have control and can do it. None of us alive have seen first hand what Christians do when they have that kind of power, but history tells us it is every bit as bad, and sometimes worse. And America is sadly heading down that road in a hurry."
30,">Inquisitions

31,"Not quite.

It is them who will alienate so many groups to fight themselves into extinction."
32,As long as they’re the Nazis and everyone else is the Jews
33,The Adolf Hitler camp of Arbeit Macht Frei
34,/s
35,You are a redditor too so how about you give it a try and report back to us?
36,Traditional christianity makes members by force and blood.
37,"I thought people would understand
