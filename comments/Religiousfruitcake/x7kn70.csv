1,As if she knows what paganism is
2,It’s got Danny Devito in it and it pisses off this uptight lot? I’m checking it out
3,"OMG, my Mormon family blew this up on our family group chat last night. I offered to watch it for them and let them know if it was as bad as they say. 

Funny kick ass show.


Edit, this the post that started it last night. 

From my sister…

“Please tell me this post isn’t real:/

[The shocking ending to the LSU opener was not the most disturbing part of the game last night.  For me, that came during a commercial break in the second quarter when the television audience was presented with the trailer for a new FX cartoon “sitcom” entitled, “LITTLE DEMON.”

How many millions will tune in to the new series, owned and marketed by DISNEY?

The trailer included dark images of Hell, demons, and satanic imagery, and an explanation that the main character is… the Antichrist(!).  

Disney provides this surreal description: “Thirteen years after being impregnated by Satan, a reluctant mother, Laura, and her Antichrist daughter, Chrissy, attempt to live an ordinary life in Delaware, but are constantly thwarted by monstrous forces, including Satan, who yearns for custody of his daughter’s soul.”

The actress who voices Laura said in an interview, “I love that we are normalizing paganism. Laura is a pagan. She’s a witch. She’s jacked.”  

Another online review explains that Chrissy discovers she’s the Antichrist “in grisly fashion, quickly reducing a gaggle of school bullies into piles of red goo in what turns out to be the first of many spectacularly gory sequences. Chrissy doesn’t seem overly concerned by the whole triple-murder thing, shrugging it off with an easy-breezy attitude that sets the tone for the rest of ‘Little Demon.’”

“Most of the show’s best moments come when it leans into its hellish premise and plumbs the depths of its own depravity. It’s likely you’ve never seen a man punch a hole in his own face before or heard the words, ‘Let’s go boil some babies while their heads are still soft’ in quite that order and, after two decades of South Park, Family Guy, and other cartoon shock merchants, an animated series finding new ways to disgust is a genuine achievement.”"
4,Has anyone actually watched the show yet? If it’s actually good I’d give it a watch
5,"I’m pretty happy it’s making them so upset ranting and raving about their children like their kids aren’t 100x more tech savvy than them and haven’t already seen everything there is to see online, 

but hey on the bright side it’s fun to laugh at full grown adults losing their shit over an animated TV series that airs at 10pm in an adult time-slot and whining about the mark of the beast for the 100th time, they really look like clowns in 2022 doing shit like this loooool 
 
Oh not to mention all the publicity they’re giving it I didn’t even know it existed till they started crying, think I’ll watch now Hahahah.

EDIT- 
I watched it and I actually enjoyed the first three episodes lol Big Danny DeVito plays the Devil I mean cmon what’s not to like, it is fucking weird though."
6,"Pagan here, the glaring majority of us don't even believe in satan. ""Normalizing Paganism"", to me, would involve making Princess Mononoke required viewing for all grade school children."
7,"But of course it's okay when their god not only impregnates a woman, but then makes her remain pregnant for seven hundred years."
8,Nothing in that description indicates paganism.
9,Lol Christianity was stolen from paganism
10,"Since they made such a fuss, I feel OBLIGATED to watch it! Thanks, Christian nut jobs!"
11,"I thought Disney already normalized paganism with Hercules, Fantasia, and Moana."
12,"Well then, guess I know what I should give a watch."
13,This has nothing to do with paganism lmfao
14,I don't think Pagans have demons or Satan or antichrists. That show is clearly based on Christian lore.
15,"Something all these inflammatory posts keep trying to imply is that this is a Disney series aimed at kids, but it's an adult animated series made by FX, who happen to be owned by Disney through Fox."
16,"I wonder why we are seeing a general spike in religious fanaticism now. Political fear mongering? Tribalism? The religious right figured out how to use social media? It’s not really about the show. The concept isn’t even original. There was a show called Lucy, Daughter of the Devil about 20 years ago and nobody said shit about it as far as I know. Anyway, I’m going to support the show now that I know they are trying to get it canceled."
17,It's funny because without their hate I wouldn't probably head about this show
18,You know.. all those Christians have tv stations DEVOTED to 24 hr Jesus stuff and YET they complain. They should be watching whatever religious channel there is and cooking or churning butter in whatever kitchen they have. All they do is complain all the time.
19,It’s amazing that they don’t what the off button is
20,“Disney distributed” could mean literally fucking anything nowadays with how many companies they own
21,At least the woman Satan impregnated was of age ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
22,"Aww, it's so cute when they get mad because their fairy tale is treated like it's a fairy tale."
23,"Oh no, people are becoming more tolerant of other religions? Say it isn’t so. /s"
24,Wow!  I guess they never watched Lucifer either!  What a waste. That show is hilarious.
25,"This isn't made for children! It like getting mad that beer ads exist because they're ""advertising to children"""
26,I’m glad my kids got to watch years of teen titan go before people went crazy like they are now
27,I only discovered The Owl House because of radical Christians complaining about it. I wouldn't have even heard of it otherwise. The Owl House is an excellent cartoon by the way. These people are only PROMOTING the show. I guess I will check it out.
28,Blame canada with their hockey hullabaloo.
29,It always amazes me how people can literally get this triggered over imaginary things. We're supposed to tolerate your sky daddy magic but you can't handle some cartoon about demons?
30,"Paganism is just as normal as Christianity, just cooler."
31,I'm gunna go ahead and assume that none of these people have ever even heard of Moral Orel.
32,"Really, Christians are getting angry over a show about the antichrist? Who would have seen that coming..."
33,Wait until they find out that Raven from Teen Titans is the daughter of a demon.
34,"Remember when these people got triggered at doom for having demons in it even tho literally the entire point is to save the world from them?



Pepperidge Farms® remembers"
35,Free advertising!
36,Christians are very welcome to get upset at this once they can demonstrate under controlled conditions that *anything* they're afraid of is real.
37,New show to watch! Haha
38,"What does ""Distributed By Disney"" have anything to do with it? Kill Bill was also distributed by Disney, along with Hocus Pocus and a bunch of other gruesome or witchcraft-y movies."
39,"Lol

Wait Little Demon was published by Disney? Maybe I should watch it..."
40,İ know what show am i watching
41,I love this show the fact that it is pissing off religious frootloops is just the icing on the cake
42,Christianity does not exist without Satan
43,What about it is pagan?   Do they not understand what the word pagan means?
44,"Seems like it's rated pretty well on imdb when you go into the breakdown and ignore the out of order 1/10s from Christian nutters.

I haven't heard of it before, yet I'll be watching this later today. Thanks, fruitcakes!"
45,"There is nothing normalizing paganism in the show, is just extended Christian lore"
46,"> Takes issue with other religions being presented to children

> Believes God and Christianity needs to be reintroduced to the educational system

Clinical insanity."
47,"maybe, you fucking fucks, if your trifecta of islam, christianity, and judaism was a tiny bit logical and had a nano ounce reading and entertainment value, then capable writers would have created some sci fi based on yours. but then you would probably get angry anyway and condemn the author or even try to stab him to death you fuuuuuuuuuuuks."
48,THE ONLY BLOOD MAGIC WE SUPPORT IS GOOD OL FASHION BIBLE BLOOD MAGIC!
49,Isn't paganism already normalized? There are plenty of pagan people in the U.S. and several festivals/conventions that happen in major cities.
50,"Let's be honest here, they're whining but they keep forgetting in their book, god effectively rapes Mary...."
51,"The solution is simple-ban everything that doesn’t praise jesus and persecute and prosecute all non believers. Oh wait, that’s Saudi Arabia."
52,Who would've known a show for adults wouldn't be too family friendly.
53,Thank you Christian lady for not only making me aware of this cartoon but also informing me where to stream it
54,Paganism is literally anything that has nothing to do with their interpretation of the entity that is their phoney god
55,Christians and hate I bet you can't make a more iconic duo
56,"That's... that's not paganism...

Christianity is the most pagan religion out there... including paganism, if you take how many people actually practise it into account."
57,Paganism was normal before Christianity. Just saying.
58,"Should remind them that Christmas was just Saturnalia (ancient roman holiday in December to celebrate the harvest) with ""Jesus"" hammered over the top."
59,Yo fuck Christians.
60,"Something else non-christian and non-other major religion? paganism!

Something else remotely related to demons or smth? PAGANISM!

Something else you are annoyed of? **PAGANISM!**

\-christian logic"
61,"If that was what’s happening, I don’t see why that’s a problem. Though that could just be me being a heathenistic pagan."
62,I have to watch this
63,"I remember Conservatives applauding Paramount + for not changing their old programming and giving in to the ""woke"" mob. Funny how they act now."
64,Looks good. Maybe I should give it a shot.
65,"Heard, never watched, knowing this triggers them, will Stream all episodes via Hulu TWICE"
66,I cannot believe Satan is so evil that he would impregnate a woman without her consent.
67,"Wait, how does it normalize paganism when the core storyline is about christianity?"
68,Cristians celebrations are all pagan based
69,Dance little Christian soldiers! DANCE!
70,Definitely read paganism as plagiarism and thought they were upset about it being too similar to The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby
71,Why don't Christians stick to watching Purflix and leave us heathens alone? s/
72,why are christians upset about christian lore? all of this already exists in the book?
73,"It amuses me how much christians hate paganism yet their religion steals heavily from it. Winter and spring solstice are the ""birth"" and ""resurrection"" of Christ. Almost like the son is modeled after the sun. This was also how they converted pagans."
74,What they don’t realize is when you don’t believe this crazy  stuff it doesn’t really matter and you can be creative and have fun with it.
75,Christians are always angry
76,"Reminds me of when the movie 'Dogma' came out, featuring George Carlin as a cardinal in this Catholic-themed comedy.

Catholics picketed outside of theaters, drawing media attention and even more viewers. Streisand Effect is a thing, yep."
77,Is it time once again for the satanic panic?
78,"shhh, don't tell them Cartoon Network already did this with a show called Lucy, Daughter Of The Devil."
79,"I love this show, people need to chill. Now they’re gonna say Danny devito is actually satan because he voices satan in the show and his last name is close to “devil”"
80,"I’m not into it anymore- but as a teen I got into Neo-paganism and Wicca for a time. There was always a running joke about how no, they didn’t believe in the devil because then you’d have to be a Christian. It funny to me that Christians are so convinced of their own mythology that they think people riffing on it is witchcraft/paganism etc. Like no, we’re laughing at you, not with you"
81,"Lol well its not like you can get an abortion anymore, now shes gotta deal with little satan!

Honestly im impressed this is a series"
82,"Can't we just go back to like 20 years ago, when everyone just ignores these religious nutjobs?"
83,shit yeah
84,of course they would be upset they were upset with good omens and lucifer. they will complain about almost any form of media
85,It's such a good show tho
86,"I gotta say tho it popped up on my Hulu, I watched some of it and it's just awful lol"
87,I need to watch this
88,Next thing you know they'll be trying to normalize Christianity!
89,Dumb fuckin people
90,"I watched episode 1 tonight. Eh. Not interesting to me. Definitely for adults, though."
91,Now I want to watch it.
92,That sounds nothing like paganism.
93,I know what I’m adding to my watchlist
94,I've been meaning to watch this.
95,It looks kinda cool
96,"oh, i’m watching this for sure!"
97,"This looks awesome, checked online it s by the creators of Rick and Morty omgomg can t waaaiit🤪🤪"
98,Guess I better start watching it
99,Christianity = paganism /s
100,Ah yes I'm sure it actually shows the conception.
