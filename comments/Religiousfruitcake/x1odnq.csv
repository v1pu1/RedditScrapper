1,Kid probably found out that the cross was an ancient torture device
2,I‚Äôd bet actual money that kid had been struck with that cross
3,Waving a torture scene at any kids is bound to scare them.
4,That poor child looks so sad and scared I want to scoop him up and carry him to a loving home where no one will beat him or try to brainwash and indoctrinate him.
5,[ Removed by Reddit ]
6,That reaction says that the parents have been abusing him and the cross is something they love more than him.
7,well that‚Äôs gonna make him more scared
8,"Why do my child afraid? I'll wave a stick with a dead man at them, kids love that! Right? Right?"
9,So CPS has been called already?
10,"https://youtu.be/aaMq0YlzSsw

Just leaving this here because the same thing is happening above.

The parents are shoving an item into their child‚Äôs face, insinuating that the confusion the child has is a result of not accepting the cross(?), instead of the parent getting all up in their face, shoving an item in front of them and yelling some shit like ‚ÄúWHY DOES THE CROSS SCARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU? SATAN?‚Äù"
11,Or maybe he‚Äôs scared because there is a man strung up on it
12,"Hmm, maybe angrily and violently waving a stick in front of your small childs face isn't the best way to help him with his fear.... But if course they don't want that. They want him afraid. Fear is the only way they know how to keep kids in line"
13,"Kids are likely to be afraid of *anything* that gets abruptly and aggressively shoved into their face‚Ä¶ come on, people, religion is not and should not be an excuse to shut off one's common freakin' sense!"
14,This is child abuse.
15,"Brandishing it at their child like its a weapon and confused why the child is scared.

""My child is scared of knives!? Wasn't an issue until I waved in their face and threatened them. Is our child a soulless serial killer?"""
16,There have been so many people who have died from exorcisms. Seriously authorities need to be called on these people.
17,Probably scared of his parents and how they act because of that thing.
18,My mother would force me to go to church (Catholic) and we would sit close to a realistic painted plaster statue of the J on the cross. I was scared shitless of it. It was disgusting and horrific. I was like 5. I thought Jesus was staring at me and it creeped me out. Maybe that's why I became an atheist at 15.
19,"üòí As creepy as a cross is,

![gif](giphy|xT9KVg8gkDEyJIrVdK)

the crazy adult waving it around as if it can radiate some kind of calming power isn't making thing better."
20,"I bet they had him watch The Passion of the Christ. Got traumatized, and this cross looks like it has a Jesus figure on it, so probably freaks him out more."
21,Did these geniuses ever consider that the tortured man nailed to it might be traumatizing to a little kid? ü§î
22,"I saw part of that video and it was so horrific. They keep shoving it in his face, ignoring his pleas to stop, and making it seem like the kid is scaring them."
23,Does he mean before he started forcibly shoving things into his face a talking loud and authoritarianly. It could be a brussel sprout and him talking about food health and that kid would still be terrified. I scared my daughter half to death last night just because i knocked on the bathroom door loudly.
24,What? I‚Äôm just shoving this dead guy on a stick in your face because it‚Äôs love. What‚Äôs to be scared of?
25,That poor child looks terrified. That cross has been used to hurt that poor kid.
26,>Why are you holding a statue of a tortured dead man in front me?
27,"They are scapegoating this child and will use him as their ‚Äúevil item‚Äù to bear the brunt of their familial abuse. I know this kid because I was this kid. 

American evangelicals love abusing kids. It‚Äôs their favorite thing to do besides lie about how good they are as Christians."
28,It‚Äôs all that indoctrination from the school system /s
29,"When I was a toddler and had sleepovers at my grandma's I was always scared of this cross with jesus on it in the guestroom. 


Guess back then I already figured religion is bad news."
30,This kid will be joining our ranks in about ten years.
31,PTSD here we go
32,The look on his face is that he‚Äôs fearful getting hit by his parents. Some one should request a wellness check
33,"One day, this will rightfully be seen as abuse."
34,"Huh, fucking weird how waving an object in front of a child can make them spooked, can‚Äôt imagine why"
35,"Ok, now try it with a dildo
Does the kid still cry?
Yeah cause it‚Äôs being shoved in his face
If he doesn‚Äôt like the trauma of Jesus then the test of a priest will truly show if he needs to be exorcised."
36,How they are holding it up to him makes me think that kid has been beaten a few times before.
37,Kid is freaked out by his parents most likely looking like fruitcakes thinking he‚Äôs possessed. Poor kid.. dumbass parents.
38,"Maybe he's scared, or at least intimidated, by the religious nutjob waving said cross in his face. I don't know, just a thought."
39,The look on that little boys face hurts my heart
40,"child abuse straight up, down and sideways. and 1.3 million likes. fucking vile."
41,Might have something to do with the fact that it's being held like a weapon in front of his face. Really looks like he's about to get beaten with a crucifix.
42,‚ÄúThis was used to publicly kill people. Why are you scared of it?!‚Äù
43,I don't think he's afraid of that cross so much as he is afraid of the asshole intimidating him with it.
44,Maybe it‚Äôs that fact that there a camera in their fucking face and is probably being told everyone is watching him. Edit. Damn that autocorrect lol ‚Äú ducking‚Äù.
45,1.3 million people clicked the button of approval on this clown show.
46,Child abuse.
47,"‚ÄúAh, yes. My child shows fear when I shove this depiction  of a mostly nude man quite literally nailed to a piece of wood, it must be the demons.‚Äù"
48,"Child abuse -crazies looking for attention,using their child.If he‚Äôs afraid of the cross it‚Äôs because they instilled that fear."
49,Could it be that seeing a person staked to a cross appearing to be dead is terrifying? Just a guess.
50,I think one of the worse parts about this is the 1.3 Million likes.
51,My kids wouldn't blink if I waved a stick at them because they don't think I'm gonna hurt them. Actually my kids would probably get in a karate like stance or go find a lightsaber to fight me back.
52,"I just want to see the conversation that happened when they ""found out"" he was ""possessed"" 

*Holds cross up to kid for no reason*

Kid: weirded out

Ron: oh my goodness Karen I believe our child is possessed

Karen: oh yes Ron I believe so let's post it on Facebook and make sure you hold that cross up to him at an arm's length so he can't get you while I take this picture and upload it to Instagram hold on sweetie only a couple more hours of staring at the cross until the pastor gets here"
53,Did ya beat him with it? That would explain a lot
54,Maybe because there‚Äôs a dead guy on it.
55,"OK I just looked at this person's tiktok and they are complete pieces of shit.  She comes in in the middle of the night while the kid is sleeping claiming she heard other voices.  Pans the bright light around under the bed talking about evil sprits in the house.  Then off screen you hear a kid's voice ""My friend say 'Hi' by the way"".  As if a three year old would talk like that.  They are using their toddler as a prop to get Tiktok views and clicks.
  
Seriously disgusting and they should not be allowed to be parents IMO."
56,"Some religious people are so strange, why are you tormenting your child and posting the abuse online"
57,Man I'd be startled if you shoved candy at my face aggressively
58,"Yeah, the psycho parents had nothing to do with it..."
59,Beat a kid with a wooden cross a couple of times and they too would be scared of it.
60,They probably beat that kid
61,"Kid is feeding off their energy and then having something aggressively shoved in their face. Yeah, I‚Äôd be scared of it too"
62,"*dad comes in randomly yelling and waving cross around in your face*

Kid: Ahhhhhh! üò®

Dad: WHY ARE YOU SCARED?! YOU MUST BE POSSESSED!

Poor squid."
63,This sucks so bad. Poor child. Those religious fruitcakes are no joke when they‚Äôre parents. Phuck them!!
64,Parents profiting off children. But anything for those tasting clicks am I right.
65,If the cross was uses to kill the dude I would think demons would enjoy the sight of it
66,"well, delusion is scary"
67,He‚Äôs scared of a religious fruitcake
68,I'm a grown man and I'm not crazy about iron age torture instruments.
69,That poor child. I see many years of therapy in his future.
70,If my parents were shaking a fucking cross with a depictions of a dead guy on it I'd be worried too. I'd be more scared of the parents but still would look the same.
71,Get child services
72,Aggressively waving something in a childs face tends to have the effect of scaring the shit out of them.
73,Maybe he's Jesus.
74,"Yeah so, if someone held a cross repeatedly in my face, saying or asking weird things while I was maybe 5 years old I would have been scared too."
75,Maybe hes scared because you keep waving a cross in his face and twlling him a demon is inside him?? God damn poor kid üò¢
76,"they think their kid is ""possessed"" and their first reaction is to record and post on tik tok???"
77,Problem with these idiots is that people online usually egg them on. Some girl was justifying putting her cat out on the skinwalker subreddit by claiming he was possessed and only a couple of people were telling her she was being insane. The rest were fine with someone literally kicking out their pet. I‚Äôm losing my fucking mind.
78,Could he be afraid of the one holding the cross?
79,I'm sure there will be no long term psychological issues to this.
80,"Parents: _**YOU WILL BURN IN HELL FOREVER UNLESS YOU PRAY TO GOD TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS!  REPENT! REPENT!  REPENT OR YOU WILL SUFFER!**_

Child: _[cries]_

Parents: We don't know why he's so afraid!"
81,Child abuse
82,Call child services.
83,"Of course it couldn't be that the kid is scared because the parent is brandishing the cross while showing menacing body/verbal language. Nah, it's not that ... it must be SATAN."
84,Call CPS.
85,He's scared of a torture device with a corpse on it. His parents empty eyes probably don't help either.
86,Nah I have a son the same age. This is child abuse. That kid has no idea what‚Äôs going on and all he knows is there‚Äôs a lot of yelling and weird shit happening and it‚Äôs overwhelming so he‚Äôs crying. I am so uncomfortable looking at this picture
87,I hate religion
88,"Why does it have 1.3M hearts (is that likes in stupid TikTok world?) 

He is a similar age to my twins boys and reminds me of them‚Ä¶I just want to hug to poor little guy"
89,"Why is this kids bed next to random storage? Why are there no sheets on the bed? Why is there a big stain on the mattress?


The more I look at this pic, the less surprised I am the kid's hand is on his chest like he's in pain.


That's not the body language of a child that feels safe."
90,"Of course not, now hes terrified, how did that not cross their minds? üôÑ"
91,"My Adventist dad had loaned me a book.  I don't remember what it was, but the author laid things out like ""this is what people used to believe; this is what people believe now; but THIS is the TRUTH"".

I told him I couldn't read it (after a couple items) and he was all concerned that I was possessed.

Sure - by common sense!  Real life has lots of shades of grey."
92,"Dude, it‚Äôs got a tiny, mangled corpse glued to it."
93,He's a smart one
94,"Poor kid, he's definitely getting abused."
95,Stay away from me big angry sky daddy.
96,"I need a little more context...
Were the parents yelling shit like 

""The power of Chris compels you!!""

""Jesus died on this for your sins. This is your fault! You did this, you little sinner bastard!"""
97,Poor kid
98,Holy shit the people in the comments are worse. People believe in all sorts of silly shit.
99,CPS CPS CPS
100,Hope someone gets this poor kid help before something terrible happens.
