1,Uno reverse card.
2,"As someone who received many of this bullshit as ‚Äútips‚Äù when I was a server, I approve"
3,"Christians do the same thing to wait staff all the time, like their religious nonsense is better than money for a tip."
4,"What in that text relates to evolution? I know fundamentalists like to call all science they don‚Äôt like evolution to make it easier to dismiss, but there isn‚Äôt even any science here. Atheism=evolution now?"
5,They leave us scriptures as tips. So here‚Äôs the world‚Äôs smallest violin
6,That's hilarious
7,*The Servers liked that*
8,"I want this to be true, but think it is satire."
9,"Perfectly ok when they do it. But when it happens to them, it's the worst thing imaginable."
10,sanctity of the church my ass
11,"""Infiltrated the sanctity of the Church"" you mean they went into the church. There was no wall to scale. No Mission Impossible music playing. They just walked in and your ""God"" let them."
12,Try waiting tables when bus loads of these Christian assholes come in and tip with bullshit bible quotes.
13,Lol how the tables have turned. Should be done more often
14,I mean ‚Ä¶ seems nice that it finally ended up where it belongs.
15,Lol Christians hand out dumb shit like that constantly and also try to meddle in school curriculums. Just zero self awareness
16,Maybe this church should tell its congregation to stop giving shit like this to the serving staff at restaurants.
17,r/leopardsatemyface
18,"I guess you could say they ""flipped the script-ure"""
19,"Beautiful! 

It's like an UNO reverse card of the shit the religious love to pull with tips at restaurants.

Love it!"
20,Where can I order some of those 20$ bills?
21,![gif](giphy|J4HP3FcGqP6Yo)
22,"I approve, but where's the lecture on evolution?"
23,"Doesn‚Äôt feel good, does it"
24,"I used to work as bouncer at a bar/bottle shop in a college town. There was this homeless dude who'd hang around outside waiting for some drunk frat boys to either give him a few cans of beer or money for beer. 


One night a couple guys were handing out Bibles on the corner across from the bar. One of them came over and gave the homeless dude one of these fake 20s. The dude was ecstatic. He usually only got change or a can of Natty light. He got himself a mix and match 6 pack of craft beer and was telling the cashier he was gonna head over to the one low income apartment building and use the fancy beer to hook up with a chick he knew there.


When the cashier told him that the 20 was a Bible thing he flipped out. He ran out the door and ran into the bible guys yelling and screaming. He went complete ape shit on them. The cops ended up arresting him, but the bible guys refused to press charges. He was back outside the bar on a few weeks and we never saw the bible guys again."
25,Absolutely beautiful üòç
26,The hero we all deserve.
27,Hellyeah. Love to see it!
28,I love this!
29,#HA!
30,Well played!
31,"Turn the other cheek, hypocrites"
32,Love the pun at the end!!!! BRILLIANT!

34,Beautiful
35,"I can't even count how many fake $20s I got when I was a waiter that turned out to be evangelical crap. No other tip nine times out of ten. If this story isn't just satire, then that church needed the lesson in irony."
36,"HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

Now they know how a server feels when they get a tip that looks like a $20 but is actually a sham with bibble verses on the reverse."
37,Why does god need money?
38,"Tbh, I don't think that christians realize how that tactic *doesn't work at all*. If I was a server, not necessarily an atheist, and received this shitty $20 preaching note, I'd be so pissed and it would have the reverse effect of what they expect, this would just make me even less interested in their religion."
39,"Based on the language, I don't think this is from a legitimate news source. :)"
40,UNO reverse card for the win!
41,Best troll ever.
42,"I love it, although I would make some edits to it, including the lengthy rant on the backside.

I wouldn't claim that no god exists, because shit, maybe there is some sort of hyper-being floating around in space or some pocket dimension somewhere, probably didn't create the universe, but who knows. Personally, I'm kind of a fan of [Futurama god.](https://youtu.be/QIBMMVJFM4M?t=26)

Instead, of the lecture on evolution (not shown in the photo) I would hold them to task on the hateful politics, dangerous medical misinformation, predatory practices (particularly targeting elderly churchgoers), bigotry, white supremacism, and domestic terrorism that many churches support and defend in the name of ""god and Christ's love."""
43,This calls for HOLY WAR!
44,Oh my own medicine! Its so bitter!
45,"That's some quality satire. 

https://www.religimarole.com/post/church-annoyed-after-20-donation-turned-out-to-be-lecture-on-evolution"
46,Trolls got trolled
47,"""An atheist has infiltrated the sanctity of the church"". No. Quit your bullshit. I'm a Christian and churches are open to everyone. That's the whole point of churches."
48,Look how the turntables.
49,"This is just as fucking stupid as religious people doing the same with fake money disguising scripture.

How about we not be dicks about this?"
50,"This is fucking amazing, whoever did this is my hero"
51,"While this is funny, telling religious people ""there is no god, you're being scammed"" seems a bit harsh. Most Christians live their life finding solace that there is an afterlife, and don't try to push it on anyone else.

Plus, a good lot of churches do actual good for their community. These donations usually go to charity."
52,"As someone who has worked sunday brunch as a serve,  all I can say is what comes around goes around. I've had 6 times where I had a tip of cash left at the table, and they were just fake notes with text about jesus. They can fuck right off."
53,"Okay, I've been a christian pastor for 37 years, but before that I was a server for a good long while. This is hysterical, and whoever created those things should make a fortune."
54,I don't like going out of my way to poke at other people's religious beliefs because i know how it feels but this is really fucking funny.
55,Infiltrated the sanctity of the church? I thought the church was supposed to be open for all to enter? At least that's what I was told in my catholic school
56,"Ohhhh, but it's ok for Christians to leave these fake money lectures as tips at restaurants. GTFO."
57,This is the way.
58,That‚Äôs  karma for all the times they tipped there servers with there Jesus dollars
59,Well then maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have people promoting their church with fake $20s.
60,Awww... did you get something that you thought had monitory value but then learned it was actually somebody lecturing you on how you should be living your life? The sure does sound annoying...
61,Good!  Getting a taste of their own medicine!
62,i lost braincells reading the website op sent.
63,"As someone who was handed these a lot when I worked at a local restaurant, *good*! Let the assholes have a taste of their own medicine!"
64,Really then maybe they should also stop shoving those fake 100 dollar bills advertising their church in my hands
65,"What is ""bilking"""
66,The picture on the right does not mention evolution.
67,Couldn't have been an atheist. Those burst into flames in churches.
68,You can't infiltrate a place that is meant to be open to all. These people shouldn't even call themselves Christians anymore.
69,"As a former server, I find this fracking hilarious"
70,"Karma-Pretty funny, considering how many of those fake monies with religious messages I've received as a server"
71,"Oh my god, this is so terrible.  Where?  Where can I get these ‚Äúbills‚Äù?

I love this a lot more than I should."
72,"So it's perfectly fine when they paper chick tracts all over the place but they pitch a fit when something similar is done to them, hypocrites"
73,Payback is a motherfucker
74,"""You dare use my own spells against me Potter?"""
75,I mean - churches started this. Leaving tips and random bills in parking lots etc that are actually their little pamphlets. It‚Äôs payback. Deal with it. Anyway - does anyone know where I can get some of these? I live in the Bible Belt and can have a blast with this.
76,Christian Among Us
77,"That's not even a lecture on evolution!!

That's just telling the church not to be greedy asses. 

*chef's kiss* Now they know how it feels when they give their fake $20s to us."
78,"Says the self-righteous assholes that do this to restaurant staff EVER SINGLE SUNDAY!(in place of an actual tip,and after being a complete pain-in-the-ASS!)"
79,How the turntables!!!
80,This made me *cackle*
81,I saw these first 20 years ago when I was walking in DFW Airport. Cool! A twenty! Then it said shit about Jesus. I don‚Äôt think Jesus would‚Äôve thought this was funny.
82,This isn't a lecture on evolution it's a lecture on TIPPING SERVERS WITH REAL MONEY.
83,"New suit........$500

New shoes.......$100

Using the churchs own tactics against it.......Priceless"
84,Honestly I'd give them fake Trump dollar bills just to give them a taste of their own medicine
85,"Yes, I'll take ten thousand of these please."
86,"I would love to join this movement. It's a win win honestly, I'll go back to church, the church gets what they deserve. Very Jesus vibes all around."
87,![gif](giphy|9MJ6xrgVR9aEwF8zCJ)
88,could you imagine? making fake money with script on them to push your agenda?
89,You dare use my own spells against me Potter?
90,'Infiltrated the sanctity of the church' ie walked through the front door..
91,"From the article:

When reminded that the fake $20 bill scam started as a way for Christians to proselytize to people by thinking they were picking up money, when in reality it was just a message that they care about money, Pastor Frontbottom had this to say, ""We were trying to save people's souls, by not only fooling them into reading a message from us, but then hoping that they would take $20 that they didn't find but earned and give it to us instead. What is wrong with that?"" 

Frontbottom was confronted with a Business Insider story that exclaims that the fake $20's were left as tips in restaurants instead of giving real money that the waitstaff earned and this is probably why the retaliation. ""The gift of Jesus is worth more than $20. it's worth your life's soul, unless of course you are giving it to us, then it's important that it's real money.""

Fuck this dude"
92,Chad dollar
93,Where can I buy several of these?
94,"Well well well, how turntable)))"
95,"After all the fake tips with religious messages on, this is a bit of catharsis, even if it's just as cruel."
96,Oh how the turntables have...
97,"One of my only real madlad moments in my life was when I was 18, working in a restaurant in Raleigh, NC. A Sunday brunch crowd Jesus freak came in with his wife and three kids, ate heartily, paid, and then tipped me with one of those bullshit fake ten dollar bill proselytizing thingies. I got super pissed, walked back out to the table, handed the guy an actual ten dollar bill and said ""The lord Jesus Christ taught me to be charitable to the poor. God bless you."" To this day, 26 years later, I don't know if the look on his face was shocked or touched, but he gave me a nod, took the money, and left. I was a strident atheist, even then, but I like to think that he got the point."
98,"I have received a number of these fake bill/bible verse mini sermons as a server and also when I was homeless. (Still not sure how couple bible verses and a few paragraphs about how I'm a sinner destined for hell was supposed to help me) 
But I think giving them a taste of their own medicine is a fantastic idea.
And those sanctimonious a-holes can get as butthurt as they want about it.
Karma is a bitch and they could use a reminder about that."
99,"I can't see anything wrong with it... 

People still believe in god in 2022 feel not so intelligent to me btw."
100,Infiltrated. Like anyone can't just walk in and attend a service
