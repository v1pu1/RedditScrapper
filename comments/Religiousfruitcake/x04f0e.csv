1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

1,"And how many vaccines did this moron willingly subject himself to when he joined? But no, 6 months away from a pension, the covid vax was a bridge too far. Wonder what his face looks like now that it's missing a nose."
2,I love it when they hurt themselves with their crazy
3,"Isn't best if we just totally remove religion from any part of government including the military? Yes, that's right idiots the military you worship is the government.

That way we wouldn't have to figure out if you believed in Santa Claus enough to avoid the duty you signed up for. Same thing with taxation, we don't care what crap you believe you still have to pay taxes."
4,"The anthrax vaccine he took came with a useful brochure about what was in the vaccine, why it was safe, and how they would definitely boot you out if you didn't take it."
5,Well… Bye.
6,"Their ""religious exemption"" requests are being denied because they didn't have any prior religious objections, and they likely don't have any personal record of registering as a member of a religion with a strict no vaccination policy. As such, they are very obviously full of shit.

He doesn't want an exemption for religion, he wants an exemption for stupidity...his own."
7,"The worst part of this story is that now we know of at least this one scummy piece of shit ass hole who was serving in our military for 20 years. Need to root out all the trash like this scum bag and get rid of them all. If you aren't willing to do something so simple as a vaccination to help protect all those around you, then you aren't going to do it in a real war situation either. You are only going to care about yourself, and endanger your squad mates. You have no business in the military, and need to go. Period."
8,"Not just when he joined, but also at deployment time, and literally every single year when it comes to the flu shot. That one wasn't optional."
9,"I agree with the taxes thing, to a degree. The reason they don't is to separate church and state, which can kind of make sense. But the thing is, the church still does use state resources and influence it. So they need to pay taxes. If they choose to live completely off the grid. Like no electric, no road connecting to their church. No delieveries that use any of those things. And made sure anyone involved with the church in any direct way wasn't allowed to run for office or vote, then yeah, that would be proper separation of church and state, and they would have the right to avoid taxes. But only under those conditions, and probably having to give up other things I wasn't thinking of too."
10,"We easily got a dozen or more in boot camp, and as mentioned, many more for various assignments and deployments. That's why the service branches have been taking harder looks at religious exemption requests by asking the very obvious question, why is that they only object now, when their service and medical records show, as mentioned, no prior objections.

Although, the wording in the post is vague. He says he was informed that he's separating. He doesn't state a discharge type and its character. It's possible that he could still be eligible for retirement and full benefits."
11,"Another reason churches don’t traditionally pay taxes is that the money was used for charity work.  Many churches today still do a large amount of charity work and are not wealthy.  However, too many are, so I believe a good workaround would be to limit the amount of profit churches can make (including salaries, stock options, savings, etc) and approve the charities they ‘donate’ to (to keep them from setting up scam charities), then tax the excess.  This would keep most churches on the straight and narrow, just like God wants."
12,Or just pay taxes like any other business. Since that's exactly what it is. A business that sells non existent products and has a never ending supply.
13,"Even off their charity work, churchs still make money. Be it from the taxes they don't pay, which far out weight their costs, normally several orders of magnitude worth. or the extra government funds they get to help, which again, go FAR above what their costs for doing it are, they absolutely make money off it. Sure, not all are rich, but they still make a lot of money from this."
