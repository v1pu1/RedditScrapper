1,But imagine this was 2k years ago and the people lied and said they DID see him come back to life
2,"I remember this one, he wasn't a pastor but the pastor convinced him to do it, that's why it's murder"
3,"I cannot think of a more terrifying way to die.

Well, maybe I could, but I sure don't want to."
4,Imagine actively volunteering for a Darwin Award.
5,"Thatâ€™s bullshit, arresting people for making the world a better place!"
6,Probably just give him enough time to brew the resurrection. Terrible behaviour by police arresting those folk. If they'd just left him long enough he'd have pulled through.
7,When you believe your own lies.
8,They shouldnâ€™t be arrested. They should have the religious freedom to continue burying their pastors alive until they find the one that truly has godâ€™s favor.
9,Darwin award lol
10,"Would love to see all of them all over the world do the same, also not just Christians all faiths."
11,"The thing that always gets me about stories like this, other than stupidity/insanity on display, is how little such zealots know of their own faith.

Like if you believe in the resurrection than you'd presumably believe it happened because Jesus was, well, Jesus. Did they think Pastor Potato was Jesus, and so could handle getting planted in the dirt?

Also even if it had worked - he'd still be buried in the ground! What was he going to do? Claw his way out like a zombie?"
12,Just stupid. Stupid and sad.
13,b.uried
14,How likely is it this mightve been assisted suicide or just a murder thats been covered up
15,"I admire him.  At least he has conviction.

Not like the evangelists who are obviously conning their believers for private yatchs and jets."
16,"""Get fucked poser."" 

- Jesus"
17,Skill issue
18,Religious people ðŸ§ƒ
19,Imagine they then proceed to write a book about it and everyone believes them so they decide they can make money off it and hold power in the government. I mean just imagine.
20,"I now  imagine jesus being in heaven laughing at him and calling him poser.  Like right when  he gets through the pearly gates, jesÃºs stands there with his posse snickering and pointing at him :""look there is the poser"""
21,"Should have checked the comments before commenting,  i just asked what the likelihood of this being murder/assisted suicide is"
22,He probably didn't believe in Darwin's theory of evolution.
23,Yea this is just nature taking care of the shallow end of the genepool
24,"Mmm, brains!"
25,Imagine they had a secret passage out of the tomb that no one else knew of and he just appeared outside of an allegedly sealed room like maaaagic~
26,But that would be judgemental of Jesus and we know Christians should never judge.....yet that's ALL they do
27,"I remember growing up in Fundamentalist Christianity, and the reason they gave for them being called the ""Darwin"" awards was it meant you were stupid - like Darwin."
28,"no the darwin award is a website (darwin awards : evolution in action) collecting stories about people who removed themselves from the genepool in a way that makes it clear that their removal probably improves the genepool. Every year the dumbest of the bunch gets the darwin award for volunteering in improving the genepool.  Most of them died, but it is not a requirement. Removing your testicals in spectacular fashion and thus being unable to procreate also counts for example.  

They also have honorable mentions for people who tried their best but ultimately failed to remove themselves from the genepool.  Like the lady who transported her christmas tree on her roof driving on the hghway and predictably lost it.  Now that is not whatgave her the honorable mention.    What did it was getting hit by cars 4 different times trying to retrieve it before the cops arrived.  Normal people would have given up after the frst time, or surely after the second. Only a true darwin hero tries it 4 times.
