1,"What is funny is this proves the opposite point they are trying to make. And that point is the guy with the Bible is kind of forcing it on someone who is literally saying no they don't want to hear it.

Also of all the videos I have seen of street preachers they are the ones who usually have megaphones."
2,That same Christian is also lobbying to overturn Obergefell and reinstate sodomy laws.
3,Never had gay people knocking on my door to convert me.
4,"Why do these ""christians"" that complain about other people having perspectives always depict themselves as thin?"
5,"I know that some people can knock at your door and ask you if you want to know about Jesus, I saw many pamphlets in my letter box assuring me that my life would be better if I accepted Jesus Christ in my life but this never happened with the LGBTQ community.
Weird..."
6,"One person is saying ""I exist. Don't ban me, don't take away my rights"" while the other is saying ""you should change your world views and your lifestyle to match mine. The way you live is wrong"". This doesn't show what they think it does."
7,Funny when I drive down to Santa Monica and there’s dozens of preachers screaming in everyone’s faces trying to enjoy their day at the beach.
8,Aren't Christian fundamentalists the ones who bring megaphones to Pride?
9,"Hey so do you guys remember the gay crusades? Or the homosexual inquisition? The Salem straight trials? All those televangesexuals who are always telling people who to love?

Yeah me either."
10,"I mean, what they’re leaving out is that everyone around is dressed in pride attire, and this dude is rudely shoveling these atrocious books to people who clearly just want to enjoy their event. So yes, “ain’t that the truth”."
11,"I hate this so much. If you drive for 10 mins in the South, you will pass like 5 churches. They are everywhere, different denominations, but they will have you think that it is gay people that are forcing their ideology."
12,"No it “ain’t”… Talk to me again when LGBTQI+ folk have been persecuting, and killing Christian’s for centuries…"
13,Pride is once a year..soooooo
14,"Getting stopped in the street to hear the good word. Receiving door visits on weekends. Having pamphlets pushed on me while waiting for the train. Constant protest and blocking walkways. Apparently that's not pushing beliefs.


Having a parade once a year. The worse."
15,"The image belies the actual issue of the religious person pushing ideas/beliefs quite literally with his hand yet in contrast the person on the right is only ""pushing"" the ""Stop pushing your beliefs on me"".  Even the pride sign is pointing away from the person on the left."
16,lol which one of these two characters is going around handing out books that explain their beliefs?
17,"I don't understand their thinking at all and I was raised around this kind of bigotry because wearing LGBTQ+ supporting clothing is not in any way, pushing your beliefs on anyone. The gay community is not looking to convert anyone. The LGBTQ+ community knows better than anyone that you cannot simply decide your orientation. You can choose to be honest about it and that is not the same thing.

So, what this tells me is that some religious people are uncomfortable with other people being open about who they are, and that says something about them.  They would rather silence those open than admit they might need to be honest about who they are too. It says more about them and their own insecurities than anything else and they use the Bible to hide behind. 

And if this straight white woman can manage to figure this shit out, it can't be that difficult."
18,"I dunno, last I checked, Christians weren't forbidden to go outside displaying their crosses... Also, last I checked saying ""I'm gay"" doesn't force anyone who hears it to be gay also..."
19,"Okay, ignoring the irony and blatant ignorance here, I’m gonna analyze the image to show how dumb it is. So the guy offers the pride advocate a Bible and they just shouted at them. But notice that he was the one initiating the spread of a belief, namely his. And note how the other person said nothing about their own views except vent their frustrations, even if the megaphone is overkill.

But beyond the meme, they’re the ones wanting to overturn gay marriage, reinstate sodomy laws, just crushed Roe vs Wade, and have their preachers allowed to call for the execution of gay people while being tax exempt. Then you have gay people who are now terrified their rights are about to be washed away and have to worry about being attacked at gay bars and on gay dating sites."
20,"The difference is religious people push onto us what they think we should be, LGBTQ+ people are telling us what they want to be. As long as someone isn't telling you what you are supposed to be, who cares? Live and let live"
21,Where I’m from it’s usually the religious nuts on the street yelling about some stupid shit. The comic should be the religious nut screaming at the gays to “stop taking my religious freedom to oppress and potentially kill you”
22,Can people stop claiming to be rational whilst simultaneously bullying anyone who doesn’t fit their centuries old idealogy
23,"Religious zealots: “You’re going to burn in hell! You shouldn’t be allowed to get married! We’re banning the word ‘gay’ in schools! You can only be saved by turning to Jesus and no longer living in sin!”  
  
LGBTQ+ people: “We just want to live our lives like every other human and not get death threats.”  
  
Also I think it’s funny that they think Pride parades equate to LGBTQ+ people “pushing their beliefs” on them when they aren’t forced to partake in any way. You don’t see people complaining about having to look at the hundreds of churches they drive by in their cities year round. It’s the same thing - it’s there but you ignore it if you don’t believe in it.  
There are public Christmas events and tree-lighting ceremonies during the holidays in my city, but you don’t see anyone trying to ban those like they try to ban Pride events. If people don’t want to participate, they just do something else or don’t open their doors to the carolers."
24,"Might as well call themselves the ""Strawman Party""

Edit: 
I know Christianity isn't fully mutually exclusive to the republican party but it's closely related and we all know it"
25,"So trying to convince someone and handing off religious propaganda is not forcing your beliefs on people, but existing and being persecuted and hated for it is?"
26,Never had a gay person stop me on the street and ask me to come to a gay study group.
27,"What ""truth"" are they telling?

And who goes to a Pride event to hand out bibbles?"
28,The guy on the left looks like Nixon
29,"Were it only just the sky wizard doinks offering books, and not the abolition of the Constitution."
30,"The Bible has basically been dismantled. It is so sad how many do not know very simple truths about their religion.

31,Yes just being prideful of yourself is the same as forcing people to abide to your beliefs
32,Typical religious narcissistic projection...
33,"there are people like this on both sides

people that like enforcing the bible upon others? that's my grandma

people that like enforcing their LGBT rights in unrelated situations? look at twitter

all the ones in the middle are good people"
34,"The hypocrisy in this. The transgender pushes freedom of gender and sexuality onto others (I am trans, not a bigoted comment), she doesn’t want Christians to influence her but she influences other’s. So then the Christian tries to influence her. Then the Christian page pushes that they never get the chance to speak, indirectly pushing onto others. The we publish it here, publicly trying to push our beliefs onto others. Like it’s a hypocriception. I am an atheist and transgender but both are in this context acting evenly good or bad, according what your norms and worths are."
35,Funny.  I see only see one person trying to hand something to someone else.
36,"I mean... they are actually getting their beliefs forced on them, sooo..."
37,The funniest thing about it is that they're asking people to follow them on Twitter if they get banned from Facebook. They'd get suspended in seconds for posting shit like this.
38,They both push their beliefs on others and equally disgusting
39,Both people should stop
40,But really though I am okay with being handed a Bible it's the demonizing of others that I think people can't handle.
41,And the person on the right is just existing. They don't even see how full of shit they are when they post that stuff.
42,"Yet, there are still Christians who believe that LGBT folks recruit or groom young people, and that's how new LGBT people are made.

But we don't have to knock on your door and hand out propaganda. Apparently we just have to exist and be visible to threaten the minds of young people."
43,If you want to there's this fantastic app called Grindr
44,I always think of Lewis Black when Gay marriage was legalized or about to be and how he made fun of the homophobes that imagine roving gangs of gay guys infiltrating neighborhoods to convert peefectly straight guys.
45,"Haha two gay friends of mine did that for Halloween, they dressed up like JW and wanted to talk to people about dick. They even had a pamphlet about the glory of cock lmao it was amazing"
46,"theyre designed to look meek and unpretentious. therefore innocuous and non threatening in comparison to the ""aggressor""

victim complex in art form"
47,"Bizarre detail to note.

But if I had to guess, it's a norm, and it puts any self insert in a positive light.

Also means that they can add fat shaming to the list of derogatory imagery of their enemies. Which is horrendous, the shape and weight of your body should never be seen as negative. Unhealthy, maybe, but not a sign of you being a lackluster human being."
48,"""You live in the sin of heterosexuality and only membership in the LGBTQIA+ community will save you from eternal damnation. Accept Freddy Mercury (I live with a Queen fan, sorry) as your Savior and your salvation will be guaranteed. Without your repentance, you will be condemned to boredom in Christian paradise for eternity, tortured by endless sermons conveying backward ideas.

Join us at the Pink Flamingo Pub Church, services every evening from 6pm to 2am"""
49,"Sadly christians say they're the ones getting banned, and the queers:tm: are the ones trying to change everyone to match their views.

If I had to guess, projecting. The christian has not even dipped their toes in LGBTQ+ communities, but are well inundated with christian community."
50,they Also wield the power of the state to make lives difficult for LGBT and also outlawing them from marriage and adoption--NOT VERY PRO FAMILY
51,Airhorns are something I'd like to blow in the faces of those annoying screachers. I mean preachers.
52,Kind of reminds me of a school I went to. It was non religious but we'd get people hanging out on the sidewalk handing out pamphlets.
53,"I read a study somewhere...the more churches there are in a town, the more bars they have in that town."
54,And church is every sunday
55,"And it's the ""have you heard the Good News?"" thing again.

OF COURSE we have heard the frickin' Good News, if we live in a Western nation, because here and in quite a number of other places Christianity is *extremely* well-known. Born of a virgin, died and rose again, walked on water, don't wear mixed fabrics, all of the rest of [that Leviticus stuff...](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2020&version=NIV) Got it. We've got it. And if any of us *haven't* got it, we can very easily get our own Bible, thank you. OK, sure, I guess we'll take the Bible you're offering, if that'll make you go away.

If you're a missionary sneaking around and trying to give people Bibles in North Korea, then yeah, you're actually doing something that, from your point of view, is well worth doing.

Standing on a milk-crate preaching, sticking unrequested tracts in people's mailboxes, otherwise Sharing the Gospel in the USA, or Britain, or Australia, or Spain, though...

That's every bit as dangerous as it is productive."
56,That's all you see because that's all you WANT to see. The nuance is lost on you.
57,"Evangelists: YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON JUST FOR HOW YOU WERE BORN AND IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE, HATE WHO YOU ARE AND FORCE OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME, YOU WILL SUFFER FOR ALL ETERNITY  


LGBTQ people: Hey, uhh... i deserve human rights"
58,Also atheists are far more likely to have read the whole Bible cover-to-cover (as opposed to a few chery picked verses) than are Christians. Lots of people became nonbelievers directly FROM reading the whole Bible cover-to-cover.
59,It's good to carry emergency toilet paper
60,"My brother, somehow, is a magnet for street preachers to pick out of the crowd. Every time we pass a street preacher of any religion, they point him out and ask him when he's going to convert and go to heaven or whatever.

I guess he just radiates atheist sinner energy."
61,I gladly accept the free bibles. Free fire wood.
62,"And yet every week, some 'youth pastor' is busted for kiddie porn or raping minors.

Every. Damn. Week."
63,"By that logic they shouldn't have to knock on doors, they should just have to walk their lives demonstrating good christianly behavior and people should be converting via the temptation they have to be that kind of person.

&#x200B;

And yet... that's not how it works, and some get desperate as the former isn't working. They knock on doors, host events that plaster how good their org is, belt out slander and fear on megaphones... so on.

People don't transform because they're presented someone. It's that said someone awakens an interior thought which becomes too prevalent to ignore."
64,it's all projection
65,"When they said that gay people were mentally ill and should be locked away, they should have known I would become gay at the mental hospital lol"
66,Oof
67,"""Hi, sorry to bother you, do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior Freddy Mercury ? He died for your sins, you know""

I'd be down honestly"
68,They'd probably have some dope ass music. Better than the atrocity that is Christian rock.
69,That sounds like so much fun that it is probably illegal.
70,"I mean.  This doesn’t seem nuanced.  It seems pretty heavy handed..?

Edit- do you mean that holding a sign is “louder” than a closed book, and the two people are therefore equally “handing” ideas to one another?"
71,Gender ideology in schools is not human right
72,I'm not lying when I say that I never once read the Bible in full until I deconverted and became agnostic.
73,When I did it grew my faith
74,Must've been trying to convert them
75,"And sometimes it's just some dude wanting a boy to touch his dick. Which is not only absolutely disgusting pedophilia, but also gay."
76,Where can I sign and join?
77,"I haven't read about anyone weaponizing an air horn, but I can't see why it might be illegal."
78,I'm sure a lot of people were against children getting taught that black people are equal to them
79,"""gender ideology"" you mean trans people existing?"
80,"Did you read about the Midianites?

https://skepticsannotatedbible.com/num/31.html"
81,It said cover to cover.
