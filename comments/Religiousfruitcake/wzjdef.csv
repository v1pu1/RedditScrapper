1,Good thing King James didnâ€™t change anything for his version of the Bible to fit his views. Definitely 100% accurate /s
2,"r/AsABlackMan

I have a hard time believing someone who is familiar with Hebrew thinking the KJV is an accurate translation"
3,"I **LOVE** winding up my religious family with King James trivia. 

He was uber gay. His love letters to Buckingham are \*chefs kiss\*. He certainly married and was prolific but dude was gay. His writings on demons, witches and magic are mainly unhinged. 

He is absolutely the child of two hyper damaged parents (promoting the nature rather than nurture argument) and would probably have been happier shagging men in the gardens rather than being king."
4,"The majority of the New Testament was likely written in Koine Greek. The Old Testament was written in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. But even then different versions of these languages were employed throughout because different parts of the Bible were written in different places at different times, eg: *3 Maccabees* appears to have been written in a variant of Koine Greek spoken around Alexandria, while *4 Maccabees* appears to have been written in a variant of Koine Greek spoken around Palestine."
5,"Two bit preachers need a book filled with strange language that no one can understand, so they can then act like a wizard and pitch their coercive bullshit.  THERE IS ZERO REASON TO BE TALKING OLD ENGLISH."
6,"It's not. In fact the KJv has numerous translation errors. 

It also contains fraudulent verses such as the long ending of Mark, the pericope adulterae (story about the adulterous woman where jesus says ""he is without sin cast first stone"") and the johannine comma in 1 John. 

People who claim the KJV is the correct interpretation don't read ancient Greek or ancient hebrew. They are merely parroting what some preacher or apologist had told them who also can't read Koine greek or ancient hebrew."
7,My moronic brother proclaims the King James bible to be the source of something something as well. He volunteers this â€˜knowledgeâ€™ to me without invitation. Must be something in the cult that makes them want to shout this out.
8,"I'm sure jesus would understand,  seeing as he was also a jew"
9,"A Jew that canâ€™t read Hebrew lol.

If he could read Hebrew he would know itâ€™s a terrible translation"
10,Naaah I donâ€™t think I will
11,I prefer the precise engineering of the Gutenberg Bible...
12,"Not to hate but why does America think the world is built around them 

It's truly weird"
13,"Don't ya know? Saw some years ago some said Yesua used the ""King James Bible"".  ðŸ¥¸"
14,They really like James huh
15,"I'm confused. Maybe I'm out of the loop, but isn't one of the main beliefs of modern Judaism that separates it from Christianity the idea that Jesus was not the son of god (or really a prophet based on what other people have said)?"
16,"I feel like it should be pointed out but there is no such thing as a perfect translation, especially for a text as significant and complex as the bible."
17,"And the Romans who made the Latin version that he used to do the English translation also had *absolutely no* political interests that may have come through in their Bible. I mean, it's not like the Roman Emperor was literally the guy in charge of the church at the time, right?"
18,"If he was going to change something you think it would have been the bits about being gay, given that King James vi / i was gay."
19,I have a hard time believing this person is familiar with any language but American English.
20,"Well yes. Thatâ€™s how it works nowadays. No one actually reads the bible, they just think they know what it means."
21,"I don't want to quibble too much (since your point in general is accurate about the KJv being a pretty crappy translation,) but the English translations are not unique in including the examples you gave, since they had generally become commonly accepted by the 4th century in most Greek and Latin texts (when Old English probably didn't even exist, let alone the Early Modern English of the KJB.)

Of course, the fact that they are all believed by at least some scholars to be later interpolations added into pre-existing texts (which was not at all uncommon in antiquity; see Homer), does throw into question the ""divinity"" of the whole thing.

(Maybe you didn't intend to imply that they were unique, but the wording of your comment made it seem that way, so I figured I'd clarify)"
22,Jesus never wrote anything because he didn't exist.
23,"Probably a ""Messianic jew"" aka born again Christian that believes themselves to be Jewish because they hold a Seder with WASP people food."
24,Itâ€™s a wierd fucking religion. Christians donâ€™t follow their Bible very well but expect everyone else to.
25,"I know many of the other translations contain the same. Never even alluded that they did. However thr KJV claims to be the most accurate, while containing the most obviously agreed upon fraudulent passages. It is no more or less accurate than other translations. 

No, my wording didn't imply they were unique. In fact the opposite."
26,"uh, yea, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows that"
27,"You're good. I probably just misunderstood what you were saying. 

My background is in history, rather than theology, so my knowledge of the KJB is centered more around the effects its publication had on the development of English-speaking culture and politics rather than the real nitty-gritty of the theology involved in its production.

As I understand it, while at the time it was billed as ""most accurate,"" it isn't widely viewed that way anymore, though its still something of the ""standard"" English translation, even though far better ones exist."
