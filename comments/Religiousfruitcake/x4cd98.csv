1,God also gave us a tailbone cuz why not? /s
2,"If you wanna call the huge amount of natural selection leading up to it ""coincidence"" that's on you.

EDIT: Also, the one on the left is *also* a product of evolution, just one step removed."
3,"The collective efforts of a large group of highly educated and hard-working biologists spread over 100+ years vs *""if it looks designed to me, it must be designed""*"
4,The man in the sky made a lot of us short sighted too. I guess he didn't want us to see things?
5,"I’m beginning to think that Christians don’t grasp the basis of arguments against “god”. It’s like they completely lack any critical thinking or are even listening to the facts being presented, almost like they are willfully ignor….ohhh…ohh no"
6,None of that has anything to do with atheism. Do these cakes of fruit realise that theists accept evolution via natural selection? Atheism makes no scientific claims at all.
7,The one on the left is a knock-off.
8,Intelligent design: a grenade | coincidence: human appendix
9,"""Your Inner Fish"": A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body by Neil Shubin has got to be one of the best books on this topic I have ever read. I highly recommend it to those with a genuine curiosity about science and evolution. Neil is the real deal, he actually spent decades in the field doing the work and is a gifted writer and communicator. 

[https://www.amazon.com/Your-Inner-Fish-Journey-3-5-Billion-Year/dp/0307277453](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Inner-Fish-Journey-3-5-Billion-Year/dp/0307277453)"
10,"I had a ‘discussion’ some time ago with a fundamentalist Christian who didn’t believe in evolution, so I asked him if he believed the world was a static, unchanging place, with no earthquakes, tectonic shift, ice ages, etc.  He said no, that the world was changing.  I then asked wouldn’t a Creator God give His creations the ability to change and adapt to a changing environment?  He said yes, to which I replied that’s evolution.  The natural hand was designed by the environmental  pressures to become what it is.  As is said, Nature has 20/20 hindsight but no foresight."
11,The fact that we have a bunch of useless organs proves we are not intelligently designed
12,They have no clue how science works and it shows
13,"Coincidence is another word for billions of years of trial and error. In fact it's not much different from what engineers are doing, work from theory as a foundation and then trial and error until satisfied."
14,"I really don't understand these ""memes"" at all. Like what are they even trying to say here?"
15,Scientific knowledge is when god.
16,"Creationist fails to understand evolution, news at 11."
17,Did you know a lot of machine learning is basically just breeding the AI you want?
18,"Yeah, I’m sure the poster knows what all those anatomy parts mean"
19,Atheism only infers non-belief in gods. Atheism makes no assertion nor does it make claims.
20,"Evolution isn’t coincidence though, it has elements of randomness certainly, but there’s a reason we call it “natural selection” and not “natural gambling”"
21,Imagine not understanding the concept behind evolution
22,The Panda's Thumb by Stephen Jay Gould describes imperfectionsin  nature that prove evolution is valid.
23,"If they had the faith they claim they wouldn’t feel the need to constantly campaign for Jesus with these tired arguments which have been refuted time and time again. At this point, I think they are just pretending not to understand to keep their cult in business"
24,"Atheist don't believe in coincidence, evolution is adapt and overcome."
25,I mean it’s not like the intelligent design was made specifically to mimic some other already existing biological feature that through millions of years of evolution became more and more efficient at doing what it’s supposed to do...
26,"This must be satire, right? Are people really that fucking stupid or is this Poe's law?"
27,"Artificiality has nothing to do with complexity. Something need not be intricate for it to be artificial. A 3d printed plastic ball is as artificial as a supercomputer, and a stone as natural as the human brain."
28,"Things like this just some contrary to their own argumentation. The robotic hand didn't start out that way, it took hundreds/thousands of researchers iterating over a ridiculous number of failed designs incrementally for decades before arriving at that point. Even then, this design may be great for certain tasks, and entirely sub-optimal for others, so the design will continue to evolve as it's applied to different use cases and problem spaces."
29,"Ah yes, the hand. Intelligently designed to only sometimes have a M. Palmaris Longus and have multiple canals that get fucked up if you use the muscles that pass through to much."
30,"No ! The one of the right is an intelligent design, designed by the Lords Evolution and Natural selection, over millions of years."
31,"The dumbest argument for a god I’ve ever heard is the “it’s impossible this just happened”. Some sound analytical and scientific thinking you have there, Sally."
32,"Ironic because the Palmaris Longus Tendon pictured in that diagram is actually vestigial and absent in a good portion of the population with no effect on motor function. For that reason it's often used for tendon grafts. Our closest primate cousins the chimps and gorillas also have this tendon but is unused. 

Evolution, folks, it's way more fascinating and more importantly, true, than what what you read in fairy tales"
33,Coincidence is a funny way of saying “forged by millions of years of competition and selection”
34,[Oopsy daisy](https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/05/mirror_hand_eight_fingers.jpg) the omniscient omnipotent being slipped
35,"A watch on a beach, yada yada yada"
36,I get annoyed at how they conflate atheism with evolutionism. The two are not automatically correlated!
37,"It's almost like engineers took inspiration from nature 🤔

Wait til they find out what machine learning achieved, a process that's literally random trial and error."
38,"The whole “coincidence” argument isn’t just stupid, it proves that they don’t even know what they’re arguing against. The best arguments are made by understanding another point of view and exposing its flaws but these people don’t even know what the leading theories like the Big Bang or evolution are. They say we call it an “accident” but science doesn’t say everything was an accident, it says everything is a chain reaction.
We are literally the results of a process that is insanely complex and took billions of years of “trial and error” to get to the point in time we are at now. Nothing is a coincidence or an accident, it’s all cause and effect."
39,"""Human creations imitate nature, therefore intelligent design is real."""
40,Any body that has periods either isn't intelligently designed or was designed by a sadist
41,I swear this sub is becoming r/atheism day by day…
42,"And an organ that explodes sometimes, just for fun."
43,God also gave giraffes extra long arteries in their neck!
44,Evolution is the best show on earth
45,Commodore Datasette was the best.
46,I know right 😂 their stupidity amazes me every time.
47,> The collective efforts of a large group of highly educated and hard-working biologists spread over 100+ years *based on a design we already have*!
48,"It could be science, if they define who designed it, prove their existence and describe the taxonomy of the designer, all that stuff. 

But they don't.  I wonder why they keep that part of their ""science"" a secret."
49,also intelligently designed cancer and parasites that fit perfectly into our intestines. it works so well it *can't* be a coincidence.
50,"Theists in general, actually don't know any science, they just tell me: ""so you think all these body parts came out of nothing?""

It just shows how ignorant they are."
51,If God made such a great design explain cancer and mental disorders
52,">	Do these cakes of fruit realise that theists accept evolution via natural selection?

No"
53,"And a priest came up with the Big Bang Theory, and Mendelian genetics…"
54,"It doesn't feel like one to me, though. It has a similar outer shape, sure, but that's just our human chauvinism. Perhaps the most useful ones are hooks and tentacles, anyway.

It uses no tendons, hydraulics. It's pure electric servos in the joints rather than muscles in the forearm. The fact signals are sent electrically seems the only notable similarity. It's manufactured differently, and is much easier to repair or replace—which is its function, as it's a prosthetic. You know, when the meat failed.

They kinda suck because of poor sensory function, lag, etc., but one day they'll be an upgrade."
55,"Their argument is that the hand on the left was designed by humans, and they think this supports the idea that the hand on the right must have been designed also, by their deity of course. Of course, this is an argument from incredulity (a logical fallacy) - they don't personally understand how a hand could have evolved without intelligent design, so they believe it must not have."
56,"No, they are actually serious... Yeah... They're this stupid."
57,~~millions~~ 6000 years
58,Many theists actually believe that. A priest came up with the Big Bang theory.
59,"I don't see what you mean here, the posts are following the sub's description. Snarking on religious people, who are stupid. Not everyone."
60,And some extra uselss teeth so the dentists can have fun.
61,Dont forget circumcision cause we are so perfect that we need to cut off our foreskin
62,What organ are you referring to?
63,"If you mean the appendix that has actually now been found to have a very important function 

It is used as a “backup storage” so to speak for our gut biome, so if something massively throws off your biome (such as a massive infection, large course of antibiotics etc) then the appendix can reset the biome"
64,*antibiotic resistance has entered the chat*
65,"A design brought about through a billions of years long struggle to eat, rather than be eaten. If there was a designer, its name was adaptation."
66,"The comment was about the scientific consensus in biology Vs some dimwitted creationist, not about the robot hand."
67,"This is his plan you know. He wants little Jimmy to die at age 5, to test the faith of his parents. I mean if you don't belive in god who planed to kill your child, are you even religious???"
68,"A banana fits in your hand, ipso facto goddo."
69,"I have nipples too, Greg. Can you milk me?"
70,"Let's hear them explain the laryngeal nerve in vertebrates too.

""The laryngeal nerve of the giraffe, linking larynx to brain, a few inches away — but because of evolutionary developments, instead dropping from the brain all the way down the neck to the heart, and then back up to the larynx.  In giraffes the nerve can be as much as 15 feet long, to make a connection a few inches away.""  (Richard Dawkins)"
71,...and brain aneurysms.
72,"You know the answers to that. ""Satan-worshipping gay atheists."""
73,Like a big firecracker ?! 😂
74,I meant mostly the comments. Nothing wrong much with the post
75,"And a tube that connects both our airway and the way to our stomach, you can get food caught up in there randomly while eating :D"
76,*so dentists can make bank
77,"Well that one isn’t a bad design thing, it doesn’t have to be cut off, it’s supposed to be a pact with god.

Even then it seems that god finds them gross."
78,That's just because god loves dick tips.
79,I mean that’s just an American thing. A strange one at that.
80,Appendix.
81,"I didn’t say it didn’t have a function, I said it randomly explodes because it can get inflamed and ruptures, which can kill you."
82,*bacteriophages have invited you to PvP*
83,👌👌
84,You can milk anything with nipples
85,"Well, it feels nice to laugh at religious people sometimes."
86,"The whole plumbing system is just shit. You've got solids, liquids, and gas going down one communal pipe. There's sewage by the entertainment district, going as far as pumping out liquid waste through the fun house.

Just how often and how serious fuckups in those areas are show how terribly designed it is so it can't possibly be intelligent, at best it would be mostly functional."
87,"And a nerve **Nervus laryngeus recurrens** to your throat that wraps around your aorta. Going from your brain to your aortic arch (at the heart) and back up to your throat.

Many mammals have hat, including giraffes. Yes. It spans their whole neck. Twice."
88,well true but in Islam they tell you its to be clean
89,The divine calamari.
90,"Oh well yeah but flaws in all our organs can be explained the same way, is the pancreas a pointless organ because some peoples pancreas just randomly stop producing insulin, is our brain flawed because it gives itself a mental illness etc 

The appendix is just as flawed as any organ"
91,O shit he can
92,And guess where they put the male g spot
93,"birds and reptiles also have a CLOACA, which is an all purpose excretory and reproductive organ. it's so versatile, it does pee, poop, and sex."
94,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1Ek-HD0
95,"Living in arid regions makes water scarce, similarly shellfish and pork etc will spoil quickly.

Some of the rules make sense, 2000 years ago.."
96,"Yeah that’s kind of what this comment thread is.
The joke is all the systems that were “designed by god” except that they suck ass and just stop working or work poorly for no reason.

So what exactly is your point?"
97,"Way up my ass! And lemme tell you, I love it!"
98,Does that mean that all birds are automatically into butt stuff?
99,"I used to believe this explanation but then I read the argument, may have been in a book by Hitch or possibly Dawkins, that it wouldn’t make sense to make such a rule because people would know it. It would be like telling someone who lives in a cold place that god commands them to where warm clothing as if anyone would have ever thought not to. 

An alternative explanation for pork is that it’s too… well… similar to human. The idea being that if you want to get people off of eating other people best not to let them eat stuff that reminds them of that yummy human meat. Alternatively maybe it’s simply about sources of pollution and impurity. Maybe pigs and shell fish and other bottom feeders made the writers of these books feel icky because of how they ate and where they lived and that was enough for the rule to be in place. 

I don’t know if I’m convinced of any of these theories mind you."
100,"Yeah okay that’s fair, I more meant it as the idea most people don’t know that the appendix does have a function but your original point does match the post 

Didn’t meant to appear to disagree with you, sorry"
