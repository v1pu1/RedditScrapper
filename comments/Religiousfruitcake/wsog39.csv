2,"Why did they photoshop a smile in the first pic? Kinda ironic that it’s a fake smile, actually makes more sense that way

Edit: autocorrect"
3,"No, no damned ""vouchers"" for you to send your kids to private school. That's SocIaLisM baby! My tax money should not go to your bigot ass. I feel sympathy for the kids, not bigots that feel their sky daddy is all powerful but can't stop the guys on his own."
4,"Every time I see shit like this, I wish I could look these people in the face and tell them how my hyper-religious homeschooling family turned out. We always had excellent standardized test scores, so our education was fine.  But now one of us is in jail, one of us committed suicide, and I will never forgive my parents. They'll consider themselves lucky if I ever speak to them again. I know conservatives don't care and that they think it could never happen to them, but it would make me feel better if I could force them to consider the possibility for a split second."
5,"This meme was created by the same type of mind that can somehow ""accidentally"" send their child to a public school. Seems like something that would be difficult to accidentally do."
6,"I had a teacher who gave class in both, public and private. And based on his experience, private schools kids are so spoiled to the point you can't even give them a red mark, much less give them a warning or little scolding because they will go to their parents and principal. You know, like little snowflakes who can't be touched nor denied anything or will be thinking they are the most attacked in the entire world.

Needless to say, he straight up told us he wishes to never, ever teach at private schools again. Even when the pay was higher.

Makes you think what group has the most fragile people."
7,"“Wokism” 

Okay so they are just making up words now"
8,"My two very christian and conservative SIL, have 3 gay kids between them."
9,"One of the kids I knew growing up was homeschooled by hyper-conservative and Christian parents. Only time I ever saw them out of the house was at a church run Boy Scouts style program. When they got their drivers license, they came out as gay and used their car to escape. They ended up struggling with that and ended up overdosing on drugs in another state."
10,Wtf is wokism
11,"Yeah, maybe this is what happens at public schools because your kids are open to so many new ideas and kids that don't have shitty parents."
12,"Paul is an idiot. I fully support everyone to express themselves in any way they see fit, as long as it doesn't physically harm another person."
13,Weren't these the same people calling for local governments to give these 'grooming' teachers guns?
14,Translation....public school teachers are outting up with the hateful racist homophobic shit im teaching my kids.
15,"Shit I sent my kid to the wrong public school, he got green hair."
16,Yassification + slay
17,Dude is straight up insane
18,"Just wait until they get to the private schools and find out there are gay people in those, too. I was private educated and had gay classmates and teachers. And because the ""don't say gay"" laws don't apply to private schools, you can be out and proud, taught about LGBT history, etc. from sunup to sundown and there isn't a fucking thing the magapede mouthbreathers can do about it. Careful what you wish for, Kleetus!"
19,"The problem is conservatives and Christians  think deep down that bad things happen to bad people and good things happen to good people. So even if you told them they'd think it was on you guys for rejecting the true message of Christ and not your parents. I find their viewpoint sickening but once you understand it, it makes their terrible politics makes sense. ""Poor people are poor cause they're bad, so we don't need to help them out with our taxes,"" is the example we see most often. At the end they don't care who commits suicide, who's life is ruined, because they think that those people only had that happen cause they were bad and not Jesus-y enough (their version of Jesus ofc)."
20,So sorry.
21,"Funny you bring  up private schools I live near one and was out doing some grocery shopping. Overheard the staff talking about kids from the school  bringing in their own cups and stealing fountain drinks. 

 The school won't do anything and the employees aren't really capable of doing much so they get away challenge free.  These are kids going to a school that cost 25K a semester. It really says something to me about how they were raised when their first choice is to steal a drink that cost very little."
22,It's a derogatory word bigots use for not being bigoted.
