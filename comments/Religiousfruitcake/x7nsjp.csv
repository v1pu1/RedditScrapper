1,"Look look ar what the bible tells us about Jesus:

* Behold I stand at the door and knock
* Whoever calls me shall never go hungry
* Behold I come quickly

Therefore, Domino's Pizza is run by Jesus. Checkmate atheists!"
2,The flying spaghetti monster has them all too… science was right!
3,"I am bread 

I am life

I am water 

I am shelter

Hey, look! I'm Jesus, too!"
4,I don't think being in total darkness would be pleasant or super healthy but I don't know that you'd actually *die* the way you would from lacking everything else on this list. You'd be functionally no worse off than a fully blind person. Take some vitamin D 🤔?
5,"OK, cut out actual air, water, light, and food, and switch to only Jesus as your source for all of those. How is survival going now?

Maybe, just maybe, the people who wrote Jesus in the first place compared him to the things they saw as essential because writers use metaphors."
6,I'm confused and just ate the bible. Wouldn't recommend.
7,"To be fair, I'm alive and have the capacity to create life. You could murder me and eat my flesh and drink my blood. I also produce CO2 which is technically air. We also have energy, which can be converted into light.

...are we all Jesus?

Maybe that was it all along.

Science confirms that we are all Jesus. Collectively."
8,Where is air food and light on the periodic table
9,"Poseidon is water.

Zeus is air.

Demeter is food.

Apollo is light.

Science is right, we need the gods of Olympus to live."
10,Blind cave fish disagree. It seems these people can't make a single point without lying.
11,Well then that settles it. Pack everything up! This proves his existence. /S
12,"That doesn't exactly sound like science. I mean it's mostly true. Though we don't exactly need light to live in a direct way, we need the energy from it and plants and stuff, and the whole ecosystem that comes from that. And we need it for our mood psychologically. But that's like the sense that we need gravity, or dirt, or a million other things.

Also anyone can claim anything."
13,I'd like 2 jesuses fir dinner plz
14,You don't need science to figure that one out... Another example of the bible trying to prove itself right with things that were already known at the time of writing.
15,"Middle eastern virgin worshipping, genital mutilating, zombie revering, cannibals."
16,They can manipulate almost anything in the bible to whatever suits them.
17,"Unless the Jesus bread is gluten free, he's no use to me other than making me gassy and bloated and making my life miserable."
18,"One of my favorite things about being a gaytheist is that I KNOW that when they see a rainbow, they think of us and it pisses them off. We totally took their symbol away and now they think of us. Quite satisfying!"
19,Technically we don’t need light
20,Return of the living dead is also good
21,I can’t even
22,Well also shelter and sleep.
23,Since when do we need light to survive?
24,Schizophrenics say the strangest things...
25,Though shalt not worship a false equivalence
26,Cherry picking to support their primitive beliefs.
27,What about seltzer?! Karen?
28,Even the loosest of correlations will do.. smh
29,I feel like we as a species kinda knew that already from instinct.
30,But I don’t have Jesus and I’m alive.
31,"Today boys and girls we are going to learn how to live off of Jesus.

Step 1: Stop breathing

Step 2: Refuse all drinks

Step 3: Don't eat anything, claim jesus provides you with all necessary sustenance

Step 4:  If jesus is light and god provides whatever you need. Close your eyes and try walking around  a busy room or building.  

You probably bumped into someone and realized you have no clue where the fuck your going.  Realize you can't live solely off jesus. Cause without food, water and air . You will starve. Have fun explaining to your coworkers why you were walking around with your eyes closed and maybe damaged yourself or property.

Fast track to getting yourself fired. Enjoy."
32,You need a human to existence?
33,"I don't feel so good. I think I'm going to die if I don't get some... light.

I'm so thirsty for light, I might pass out and die. Because i and every human on this earth, just like plants, who have chlorophyll, even though we dont, need light in order to stay alive... because... science said so. Also, Jesus for some reason.

...What a fucking idiot..."
34,Food is ... basic element?
35,It’s almost like the bible was written with all this in mind…
36,No he's not water
37,I can't be the only one who read those basic elements like I was doing avatar intro.
38,Bruh you you fucking killed him shouldn’t we all be dead?
39,So blind people are sentient inorganic entities then?
40,Someone invent a time machine so we can alert all the humans that existed before Jesus they aren't alive.
41,More I read about religion more I realise…Jesus had an ego a problem
42,"I could not have said it more correctly!!

And we should take this moment to pray for the poor souls that were around before the mighty science told them they needed air, food and water and must have been so hard to survive"
43,Lucifer is the Angel of light actually
44,"#Element

•Food😉🤟🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
45,I’m a manipulative magician. OMG- I am Jesus!
46,"Scientific Jesus is now the one that I will secretly be ""praying"" to from now on! 

Bow your heads and let us ""pray""."
47,"Every single human being is 70% water, so we are living water lol"

54,I have been touched by His Noodly Appendage!
55,"oh wow! u gonna add the 11th commandment ""Don't Shove Cookies in Greg's Console Dammit!""?"
56,He didn’t even list shelter. So Jesus is leaving you out in he cold and you’re gonna die of exposure.
57,"No, I think that makes you a bible"
58,Water is the essence of wetness.
59,I AM THE TABLE
60,"Nah it’s like don’t starve, stay in the dark and ya git got"
61,Lack of photosynthesis would end up killing the planet.
62,I mean if light is on the list I don't see why human contact isn't
63,well if you do that you might actually meet him /s
64,Are you trying to say we can't take every word in the bible literally (but only when it serves our best interests)? Blasphemy!
65,"My cousin was vaccinated by Jesus.  His church even sold shirts that said as much. 

He's dead.

I'm being silly, but it's the sad truth.  He was only 50."
66,"Well, that’s the fifth thing you need - fiber!"
67,"In this context, ""element"" means ""a constituent part of; building block, component.""

Elemental - ""of, relating to, or being the basic or essential constituent of something; fundamental."""
68,And water
69,"I mean, light is in the standard model"
70,[deleted]
71,"The reason we need light is cause this guy couldn't find a quote where Jesus says ""I am shelter"""
72,Fr we arent plants and dont do photosintesis 💀
73,We can just eat hydrothermal bacteria off the ocean floor to survive
74,"A basic element to human life, in the sense that an ""element"" is a component of something. Linguistically speaking, ""elements"" are more than the periodic table."
75,"He probably doesn’t make sure his partner is satisfied, either. How selfish can a Messiah be?"
76,Idk it’s been 2000 years
77,he needs to come quickly if hes gonna satisfy the hunger of the entire world
78,"Yeah apparently, he's into some really fucked up stuff!"
79,"So far, it's been approximately 2022 years since he told his disciples he'd be back within their lifetime."
80,Accept his noodle inside of your soul!
81,But he’s only three
82,"The planet, yes. An individual? No. If someone locked you in a box with food, water, and a ventilation system you would survive for however long it took before you ended it all yourself."
83,"I'm sorry for your loss.

So many people were fooled into believing that would protect them from sickness."
84,That is so fucked. Have you considered suing the church?
85,">air

air isn't compound dipshit it's mixture of many compounds and elements

also it's questionable to why he said 'basic' elements if he wanted use the word loosely"
86,You don't speak for all of us!
87,He’s called the Messiah because he mess with ya
88,If your pizza doesn't arrive in 3000 years then it's free
89,Haven’t you read the first page of the bible? People are suppose to live at least like 900 years.
90,The original Soon™
91,well fuck him
92,No shit. But if we want to be here long term we need plants/algae to survive. Get rid of light and we're gonna die from a lack of oxygen before we'll ever reach old age.
93,All pizzas are free @ the rapture?
94,"Indeed. That lifespan seems to have ended by the third or fourth book of the Old Testament, though. Weird."
