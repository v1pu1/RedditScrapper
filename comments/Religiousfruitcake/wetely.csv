12,"People like this think it‚Äôs child abuse for same sex couples to have kids. 

I think *this* is the real child abuse."
13,"I'd want to hug that kid because his life is awful... I hated being a Christian child. Always trying to be good yet never can be good enough...I hate Christianity for how it creates a feeling of emptiness in you because you aren't allowed to fill that hole with pride and belief in yourself. You grow up a dog that was told it's loved but is a piece of garbage in it's treatment. You must repent for wanting to matter as your betters and Jesus are the only one who are good or comprehend what God wants. It's abuse and I firmly believe that a religious upbringing from a young age is a form of child abuse. They are obsessed with getting to the children before they form opinions and learn to think. They want to form that mind to work like theirs, and young kids will let you mold them. They want children quoting the Bible and praying for the same reason many want baby animals... You can force that creature to do what you want while it's helpless and weak without being stopped by anyone. It's grooming, hard stop. It's grooming and they use it to create more empty and angry people to fill their ranks as they march and tell everyone about how their rights are being abused. It's brainwashing and they are fighting tooth and nail to never have their ""child rearing"" questioned as they know they are abusive monsters and they don't want to stop. Maybe it's for Jesus or maybe it's just power but these shit heads want to abuse weak people until they become soldiers for Christ. It's actually quite terrifying to think about the endless abuse being done to kids because of an outdated text that no longer represents our ideals."
14,Child abuse

26,"That boy's daddy tried his fire and brimstone preachin' here in Oregon...and was laughed at. Kind of funny to listen to people in the background and passersby making fun of him.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_BJeexszbCc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BJeexszbCc)"
27,"Nah, these people hate him."
28,"No news is good news, probly got bullied and reconsidered everything"
29,Never getting to fully explore just who you are. Growing up as a version of yourself that is constantly terrified and hyper on guard so as not to incur wrath from many directions (in my experience).
30,"Preach. 

Some of us get over it, though, at least to the degree we can. 

My own kids are firmly atheist and agnostic, whereas I grew up in a doomsday cult. (WWCG)"
31,"Totally get it. I was damaged as a kid by a very conservative religious upbringing steeped with guilt and shame-and plenty of arbitrary rules often backed by a handful of cherry picked passages of scripture which were pulled entirely out of context.

Thankfully I found that not all sects of Christianity are such hypocritical assholes. Those that try to live by the biblical accounts in the New Testament of how Christ treated people (including the homeless, sick, poor, mentally ill, widows, orphans, drunks, whores, thieves, tax collectors, etc) with nothing but love and compassion are the ones I gravitate toward. Jesus was also pretty hard on self-righteous assholes who claimed to be ""speaking for God"" in order to control others.

OT God (OG?) became a mean SOB after Adam and Eve fucked up the ONE rule he gave them though...Which is apparently why he sent himself down to earth in the form of a human to give everyone a second chance. Too bad we killed NT Jesus (because we're not fans of humans claiming to be deities) but that somehow appeased OG into not smiting us on a daily basis. So...God allows himself to be killed in human form to satisfy his wrath over our fuck ups. Got it.

If that's the basic narrative though, I can deal with it."
32,"Its not the kid we can't stand, its whoever is responsible for their upbringing who allowed someone to mistreat them like this."
33,I read that in Billy Mays' voice. LOL.
34,How can i get one üëÅüëÑüëÅ
35,Its also a dessert topping.
36,Lol.  Now I wish I had the Photoshop skills to make a fake product.
37,The random person i accidentally ran over on my way home: Jesus blood
38,"Then they should just mass produce the stuff.  Put it in bottles, sell it by the case in Costco."
39,"My wife often complains about my aim, but never her own."
40,Yes which there are no freaking call outs about the poor kiddo being brainwashed.
41,Jesus whole life was meant to be a sacrifice so it's not too bad...Yahweh literally made it that way. Judas was born to betray Jesus and Jesus was born to die a sacrifice to save the world. I comprehend the sales pitch very well. Issue is that I just hard reject the whole Bible as a book of parables about how to live a good life. It's outdated and I flat out reject parts of it without question. It's a very old book that represents an early form of humanity trying to comprehend the world they lived in. I don't hate the stories necessarily but I do reject the religions it's created.
42,Yup. Again‚Ä¶.Why the tittle though? What is the kid gonna do with this stupid feedback?
43,AND a floor wax!!
44,Scratch on your car? Jesus blood blends it right out!
45,"""This child preaches like a grown man!"" Hm definitely no indoctrination here it's the wicked gays doing it"
46,"I have seen very valid comments by people concerned about the mental and emotional damage done to this child. But it seems the person running the account is deleting any comments that call them out for child abuse. 

I did see one comment ""You do realise there is a very high likelihood this kid will end up an atheist"". The uploader engaged with them and asked why. The person explained why it was common for fundy kids to leave christianity more than moderate christian kids. That comment and the entire thread is now gone."
47,The problem is the kid can‚Äôt do anything about it
48,No!  It's a dessert topping!
49,The truth about what his insane christian parents have done to the kid will set him free from these religious beliefs. Ironically this is based off of a christian saying.
50,What‚Äôs the saying?
51,"""Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù John 8:32. 

And for a lot of kids raised in fundy homes, they learned the truth that the mythology and theology they were raised in is abusive and immoral.

Edit to add: ironically you also learn Jesus in the bible us also abusive, manipulative and immoral."
