1,"He was also sexually abusing BOTH of them. Watched the documentary on this case SO MANY times. The real story isn’t an Honor Killing thing like everyone is making it out to be. The girls were dating non-muslims, but were more and more talking about what their home life was like, and sharing intimate details of the abuse to their boyfriends etc. 
So sad."
2,He also married a non Muslim when she was 15/16 🤨🤨
3,"I hope the family that hid him face charges too.  


edit: The article actually says that both relatives that hid him got about 12 years."
4,"He was 30 miles away living with his brother and son and it took them TWELVE YEARS TO FUCKING FIND HIM????? Fuck me Texas, your police truly are the most useless people ever."
5,bro couldn’t just ground them or something like every other extremely religious parent
6,"I remember seeing his bitch ass on America’s most wanted years ago, and hoping he was dead in a ditch somewhere. At least they caught him finally."
7,Vermin.
8,Ideas so “good” they have to be mandatory aren’t very good at all.
9,Oh I'm so glad they finally caught him. I thought about these two girls often over the years. I hope they lock him up forever
10,"This isnt too uncommon. Its called ""honor killing"" iirc

Killing your daughter to prevent the family disgrace of them dating a non muslim. Ive heard about this a few times on the news in Denmark. 

Some people are a bit weird"
11,"This is what religion does. It murders, it hates, it oppresses."
12,Fuck trial put him in a gas chamber.
13,Texas pigs are absolutely incompetent.
14,"These two beautiful human beings gone because of unimaginable hatred. 

So much unfulfilled potential. These ladies could have been the diplomats who negotiated peace in the middle east or the doctors who cured cancer.  
Gone only because of their desire to be normal teenagers.  

How can you hate *anyone*  that much,  let alone your own children. 

FFS."
15,"I heard about this case a long time ago. Incrediably sad, and I'm glad they finally caught him."
16,Exclusive wisdom of Muslim communities
17,"link to the article:

18,#noahgettheboat for sure. Disgusting.
19,Fuck RELIGION.
20,I was so happy when I heard he was caught. Hope he gets raked over every single piece of coal on the way to prison.
21,I remember watching the documentary about this. Really sad. Hope this piece of dog shit gets what he deserves.
22,He could have just settled for a peaceful life with mixed grandkids and have his son in laws explain American football.
23,Islam: They finally invented the worst religion.
24,"Like my Dad said, ""I hope he enjoys his honor in prison""."
25,"The only upside to seeing that post is that they actually found him. I was familiar with the story, but I didn’t realize they finally caught him. Hopefully he rots."
26,"I remember watching this case on ID channel, it was very sad."
27,"They did a documentary about this called The Price of Honor, I highly recommend if you haven’t seen. There’s so much more to the story, including suspicion that their American mother lured them back to see their father, knowing what was going to happen. It stuck with me for years after I saw it. I legitimately cried when I heard they finally found and arrested him."
28,"Of course, the bastard was abusing them sexually…"
29,"There is a powerful documentary on the case called the Price of Honour.

It's worth a watch"
30,Religion is such a wonderful loving thing. /s
31,"Kill the sand sniffing fucker
And i am Egyptian too kill him he needs to rot in whatever fucking hellhole he believes in"
32,So glad they got him. I remember hear this story so long ago on Crime Junkies
33,Is honor killing a religious thing or a cultural thing? Or is it a mix of both.
34,"At last justice, Rip for both of the girls."
35,"Perfect example of why the whole “belief in God is necessary for objective morality” argument is complete bullshit. 

While it’s true that atheist and agnostic folks don’t have anything to dictate what is *objectively* moral, but being freed from religious dogma, hopefully we can agree that murder, slavery, human trafficking etc are bad. 

But religious people have never agreed (even amongst themselves) on what “God” has decreed to be moral. Therefore some in the Islamic world approve of honor killings while others do not. Some Christians support marriage equality while others do not. 

In other words, no one truly can say what is objectively moral. But I think it’s much safer to have people rely on their own common sense, compassion etc than on what they imagine God is commanding them to do."
36,"Hmmm... Why am I not surprised... Might it be because, contrary to reddit believe, Islam is not a peaceful religion you can easily coexist with?"
37,I remember seeing the heartbreak of the elder girl's boyfriend.  I hope he will see justice happen and I hope they throw the book at that monstrous father.
38,"I’m sorry, but fuck your religion. I don’t know, maybe fuck you not your religion. Or fuck both of you? Shove a camel’s eggplant 🍆 up your holy asshole."
39,I don't understand how they don't even feel anything to the point of being ok with killing their own child. This is the point where you ask yourself is it worth to follow a religion who allow that.
40,Was this on SVU?
41,Fry his balls
42,"They finally caught him?! I've been following this story for years, I hate this mf with every fiber of my being. I hope he quite literally rots alive. I wish him leprosy and depression."
43,I heard about this years ago. I’m glad that piece of Shit was caught.
44,Who was hiding this POS for 12 years.. they need to be in prison as well.. like wtf.. I have two daughters and I just can’t imagine being that psychotic to actually murder my own babies because they choose to do something that makes them happy.. like wtf is wrong with people
45,Didn’t they make a documentary about this?
46,Religion tends to effect women more negatively than men on account of Christianity and Islam being patriarchies where men hold more privilege than women
47,This is why I don't follow religion.
48,Intermarriage between a Muslim and non Muslim isn't banned in Islam. It's a cultural taboo but it's not banned
49,oh god that's fucking horrendous. what's the name of this documentary?
50,">He was also sexually abusing BOTH of them.

Sadly, right on brand for these extremists of all kinds getting up in arms over ""family values"", like assholes advocating against trans people in bathrooms getting caught with their computers full of child abuse photos and videos."
51,"Glad you said it, too many people are just chalking it up as ""Oh look typical religion!!1"" but this guy was a psycho on top of religion."
52,Did they finally catch him? I’ve also watched the documentary and it breaks my heart. He’s hotten away for too long!
53,"Muslim men are allowed to marry nonMuslim women (: 

Muslim women are not (: 

Because the children take on the father's religions. 

It's sad bc my friend is Shia and she's talking to a Sunni guy and likes him A LOT but they can't date because her family will never accept him & she wants her kids to be Shia. The guy doesn't want to be Shia. They're still talking and I tell her she's hurting herself by extending it longer but what can u do i guess"
54,"So, shouldn't his brother and son also be punished? All three of them and anyone knowingly assisting a murderer should be punished."
55,"Correction. 

Texas is the most useless state ever. Or place."
56,"I don't think that they were looking, looks like they didn't care about this case.
You don't have to be a police officer to figure that if someone isn't home, they're likely in their family or friends' houses."
57,Seriously what the fuck. Swear to god I'll never set foot in that backwards ass state
58,"It took ten years to find and kill bin Laden, and he was found in his house."
59,"Texas is objectively useless, but this guy was on the FBI Top Ten the entire time. A whoooooole lotta law enforcement dropped the ball on that one. I’m from DFW and had the exact same shock hearing where he was found, I had always assumed he’d gone to the ME."
60,"No, it's about honor in religion.  His children dishonored him and his family name by going against religious laws.  There's a huge amount of pressure for him to get his family under control by the religious community, and by the religious government - including the religious police.  

The real problem comes in when those kids say, rightfully, that he's nuts and they don't want any part of him if he's going to be a religious nutjob asshole.  Then he kills them, because the religious part of him feels that he has every duty and right to.  

Your ""radical religious"" people that just ground kids aren't radical.  They just support the radicals that beat the shit out of their kids if they should do something like say a bad word like fuck, moist, or 'charlie horse'.  They don't do it, but they sure as fuck give money to people that reinforce weekly, that children should get the rod."
61,Well..they do do grounding it's just...a different kind. 6 feet under.
62,"Lol you think they do grounding? 

You get your ass fucking beat lol"
63,"Right, so glad they finally got him."
64,"Yes, it was a 'Romeo and Juliet' episode right?? She was dating a black dude, and their mother and sister decided to run away but suddenly the 'slave mentality' of mother rang through and she bought all of them back to his home, where upon entering the house, he shot both of them and ran away."
65,"No, this is what sociopaths, sadists, and narcissists do. (Or just people who take ancient ideas *way* too seriously. There is good in religion, but yeah, some of the older parts have to go.)"
66,"Prophet Mohammad ordered his followers to love him more than they love their parents, children and all humankind, otherwise they are not true believers —> you will be roasted in hellfire for eternity."
67,"They were female children, worth less than nothing to this animal"
68,really gonna generalize like that?
69,"That's a horrible source. Opindia is a indian far right news outlet, that runs on fear mongering, by showing that all muslims are trying kill the Hindus."
70,"I think Scientology competes for this, no?"
71,Both.   You also see it in cultures with caste systems
72,oof it is DEFINITELY banned. muslim men can marry christian or jew women but even that has some conditions. and muslim women cannot marry non muslim men AT ALL.
73,"The Price of Honor 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3220114/"
74,"THIS GUY wasn’t a devout practicing muslim man though. He later claimed to be after he’d killed his daughters, BUT he married a christian texas woman who then “converted” and they had their children.  
She put up with his abuses, covered for him and then KNEW where he was hiding for the last 12 years and kept quiet."
75,They do it to cover their butts and use it as a distraction technique. Hoping you'll get caught up in that rather than investigating what they do behind the scenes.
76,Sexually abusing kids is also typical religion though.
77,"Well, it is though. Child abuse is one of the main pillars Islam is build onto. The Koran literally states that 50 year old Mohamed was married and had sex with a 9 year old girl. I am not sure how else as abuse we would call this today.

Also sex with children (girls and boys) is very common in the Muslim world and is in a lot of cases even social accepted.

Here is a good documentary about sex with young boys in Pakistan:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NMp2wm0VMUs"
78,"It's a shame that some dumb cult a dude made up in the fucking stone age will actually keep them apart. I feel so bad for ppl who are indoctrinated from birth.

It's such a privilege to grow up without that bullshit"
79,Religions are a virus inside the brain that infect the way we think in a very creepy way.
80,I read a story like that by Billy Shakespeare. Did not end well.
81,"In Pakistan; Ahmadi's are considered outcastes and second rate citizens.  The hatred is so much that you need to sign a declaration stating Ahmadis are not muslims to get a Pakistani passport.

Pakistanis also  export this hatred to countries like the UK.

[An Ahmadi British resident was murdered by a Pakistani Taxi driver who travelled hours to knife him because the Ahmadi dated to dared to say happy Easter.](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/man-admits-murdering-shopkeeper-who-wished-christians-happy-easter-a3290316.html)"
82,"There is one motto my county in the Balkans operates on and thats that Germany is always there waiting for you.

They could escape tomorrow, go anywhere they can and never look back. I never understood why people choose to remain living with someone who wishes to control them or in a similar situation like that.

I personally value my freedom more than anything and would rather become homeless and starve to death than live someone else's life. My freedom is worth dying for. 

And even though I always shit on Murica, there is something that Im deeply jealous of. Its the fact Americans are just built like that, they have to be free. The laws might forbid some things, but the brains of you Americans are just wired that way so you gotta live your best life. And for that I love you."
83,Teach the kids both versions since they aren't entirely different religions. Best of both worlds and when they're old enough they can decide.
84,"Yup I know that, it’s bullshit"
85,"They were punished - 10 years for the son, 12 years for the brother:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaser\_Abdel\_Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaser_Abdel_Said)

The story is pretty heartbreaking - the mother persuaded the kids to come back home, and shortly thereafter, their father killed them. The mother bears a lot of culpability for this too, it seems."
86,Please someone save me from this damn state
87,Youve hee’d your last haw now the texans are rapidly approaching your destination
88,*looks around nervously in Floridaman*
89,"Texas is bad, but there are at least 5 states even worse. Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana only gets a pass because of New Orleans."
90,BBQ tho...
91,"bin-Laden went on the run in 1998 and the building he was killed in was built in 2006. At some point, US allies in the ISI actually used what would become bin-Laden’s compound as a safe house. We’re not sure exactly when he moved there, but when he did he spent years keeping mostly to the part without windows. So yes, he was killed in his house in 2011 but that leaves out a lot of context"
92,"A person who would ground their kid for dating someone outside the religion is still radical, just obviously not as bad as a murderer. But this happened in Texas so I don't think there's a religious government or police encouraging him to do honor-killings over his kids dating non-Muslims."
93,"No, it's about ""honor"" in backwards cultures, like Pakistan. The religion gets slapped on as extra ""justification"" after the fact."
94,"ex-Muslim here. Yep, got my ass beat when my parents found out I had a boyfriend. They also took me out of public school after that. We often got the belt growing up for all sorts of things. I don’t know why I still talk to my parents, honestly."
95,"I can't believe the amount of violence that goes on in fundamentalist religious households. It's horrifying. Muslim children have it particularly bad, especially in Somalia. That country stuck out to me bc the statistics for corporal punishment was 90-something percent. Over 90% of children said they were beaten regularly at home. Wtf"
96,"Ugh I remember this, I was in a rage at those parents. Both total pieces of shit"
97,"Even the mom is a piece of shit.

What's wrong with this cult? I've never seen such a high propensity of Stockholm Syndrome and Pickmeism in women from other religions.

They basically racing to shoot themselves on the foot."
98,"Christianity and Islam are both founded on and only exists because of the vast amounts of blood murder torture cultural destruction theft. 


Religion enables and validates domestic abuse across the world. It validates hate crimes, it enables the oppression of women it hides and protects child rapists. 

Its a lot harder for people to commit these crimes without the framework of superstitious nonsense to generate motivation."
99,There is literally nothing good about religion that cannot be accomplished without religion.
100,"Religion is a cancer and I'm so happy that it's in decline. Every year, the numbers drop a little more lol"
