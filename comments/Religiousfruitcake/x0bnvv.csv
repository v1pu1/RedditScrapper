1,"This is somewhat old news in Brazil but I've only learned about the existence of this person today. 

Mario Schwartzmann was a fervently religious anti-vax influencer who believed in Flath Earth theory, religious healing, that vaccines are poison and apparently most conspiracies available out there. He died due to complications of diabetes that went untreated.

From what I can gather his main claim to fame was participating in a popular interview podcast, Ã€ Deriva, run by Arthur Petry. Here's the excerpt of the interview that I watched and attempt to describe below, [https://archive.ph/R4Ln2](https://archive.ph/R4Ln2)

In this video he spouted conspiracy theories about Bill Gates attempting to force people to stop eating meat because, according to him, GMO meat alternatives would be more profitable since Bill Gates owns the vast majority of arable land in the US. He followed it up by suggesting that these were the signs of the coming Biblical Apocalypse, and when asked by Arthur Petry, the interviewer, to explain his theory and elaborate further on the role of Bill Gates in the Apocalypse, he became very defensive and claimed the interviewer was mocking him. The interviewers tone was very neutral when asking questions and he stated that he was genuinely trying to understand Schwartzmann's point of view, which to me seems accurate. He's usually a thorough interviewer and tries to get into the headspace of his guests, but legitimately explaining his claims might have been a bit too much of an ask for Schwartzmann. The interview got derailed after that as he became more aggressive and stated he wasn't sure about Bill Gates precise role, but that he might have been facilitating the coming of the Antichrist by creating the Mark of the Beast (probably with the vax microchips) and etc., while the interviewer just stopped trying to coddle him and went fuck-it mode, actually antagonizing Schwartzmann in return.

Here's the full interview, which is nearly 6 hours long (I mentioned he was thorough) and I won't really bother to dive further in: [https://archive.ph/v7MEA](https://archive.ph/v7MEA)

Now, my personal translation of the picture depicted in the post, which seems to have been written by a family member and posted on his instagram account in January 13th. I could have changed the structure to make it more comprehensible in English, but I tried to keep it closer to the post and some of it is of uncertain interpretation in Portuguese anyway due to punctuation and capitalization:

***""He was never going to accept denying his faith and living on while dependent on medicine.***

***Yesterday morning I took him to the ER, but he didn't want to go in and got more and more distressed, he spoke of God, asked for forgiveness, and prayed the whole time.***

***I was alone with him in the ER (in the neighboring city) and had to return home. He was very adamant.***

***He arrived home, calmed down and had a meal.***

***Around 3 in the morning he went with Christ, in whom he had complete faith. To those of you who loved Mario, please plead in the name of Jesus, the king, the son of the Father, that he bestow infinite glory and joy upon him.***

***I looked after him with all my faith, praying every second.***

***Everything that I asked for with love in his name has been done.""***

According to all sources I can find he had diabetes and refused to get treatment. I did a quick search about him and found this rather relevant video that he posted himself: [https://archive.ph/BaWID](https://archive.ph/BaWID)

In this video he categorically states that diabetes does not exist, along with every other disease. According to him there are only diseases of the mind that then affect the body, and he cites the laws off attraction (Yes, those laws of attraction) as the mechanism of ailments. The universe manifests upon you what you visualize and in accordance with your ""vibes"".

There are many videos in the Brazilian ""influencer-sphere"" about this interview and death. And as you can see he really was quite a character, with obvious right-wing ties, other interview appearances (notably on conservative podcasts) and who knows how many videos and posts he published himself. One day I might try to dive a bit deeper.

I never posted here before so I hope this is following the rules, and that the formatting is ok. I can change any part of it if necessary.

I would also like to request to any available mod to sticky this comment to the top, as it's quite important to the understanding of the post by non-Portuguese speakers."

This entire universe is their game world. Why would they care about one out of possibly quintillions of NPCs?"
