1,Neil Gaiman is a treasure. I adore him.
2,Is it… is it Neil Gaiman’s last name that makes them think he writes gay sex?
3,"If Gaiman writes about gay sex, it will have the plot of a lifetime and I'd read the heck out of that."
4,I did look into this person who said this and yeah they are for real and think like this.
5,what does he means reject logos?  that's bad autocorrect for what?
6,"I've read both Tolkien and Gaiman. I'm a huge fan of both especially once I learned that Gaiman is an ex scientology member and Tolkien told Nazis to essentially go fuck themselves.

Also go listen to Gaiman give a speech or talk at an event if you haven't had the chance.

He's highly insightful and pretty inspirational. Outside of comics. He's written quite a few books I also really enjoy."
7,"And what happens if I don't accept Jesus? Hurt me? If so why would I accept such a toxic, abusive person into my life? I dumbed a boyfriend for being an abusive piece of shit?"
8,"Sounds like the person replying has never read Gaiman or Tolkien, I much prefer Neil.  He is way more versatile!"
9, EXACTLY. Threatening me with hell only further convinced that your god/book of magic is full of shit.
10,Writing about gay sex is good for the soul.
11,"EA

its in my ass"
12,Neil Gaiman is an excellent author and all-around cool guy
13,Plot twist: Neil Gaiman is secretly  Chuck Tingle
14,"Christians sure are uppity these days. They need to be spanked, I think."
15,Well this just made my day
16,What if Jesus was gay? They gonna punish him for that?
17,Neil Gaiman is a fucking madlad
18,You don’t know who Neil Gaiman is?!?
19,"I guess somebody had some issues with *Murder Mysteries*, then?"
20,Never too late - why not start now?
21,Did my dude forget about the taxi driver and the djinn smashing in American Gods??
22,NGL Neil is easily as good as Tolkien
23,"Jesus Christ last time I heard the word logos was in Neon Genesis Evangelion. These Christians really are out there larping their fantasy reality. Do they know how stupid their faux intellectual mysticism sounds? 

It'll be ""trans people have the gates of guf in their pants, and that's why the climate is changing"" next"
24,Idk if logos made hard R martin famous but go on queen
25,You don’t know who Neil Gaiman is?
26,Neil Gaiman’s family is in Scientology. He chose not to be. Another reason to love him.
27,Neil is such an amazing human being.
28,"Mmm, no there’s one (1) implied/a fade to black gay sex scene in the American Gods novel — but more likely they saw the scenes in the American Gods series or the more recent Sandman series and just assumed all he wrote was gay sex."
29,"that's the only thing that I can think of,  his next series will probably have gay sex in it though."
30,"When I learned Gaiman was supportive of gay men, I was like, well he kind of has to be, doesn't he?"
31,"I love Neil Gaiman! He's always had a decent amount of gay and nonbinary characters but his books aren't sexual. And even though he's really famous and popular, the tickets I bought to hear him speak live were only $5 which made me love him more!"
32,LEGOs. Accept Unikitty as your lord and savior!
33,"I thought logos was referring to ethos/pathos/logos, logos meaning logic. But I think the person who mentioned the definition in the context of Christian theology is more accurate"
34,"Definition: the Word of God, or principle of divine reason and creative order, identified in the Gospel of John with the second person of the Trinity incarnate in Jesus Christ.

Edit: just copied and pasted from google 😅"
35,"Did a little Google searching because I can and this is what I’ve found (combined with my own background knowledge of Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity).

Aristotle used logos to simply refer to reason or proof in rhetorical argumentation. You may have heard of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in a literature class or something.

Logos as a Greek philosophical term, however, is associated with divine reason. The Stoic school used it to refer to active reason pervading the physical world, sometimes even as the thing connecting us all spiritually. Philo of Alexandria, an important Hellenistic Jewish thinker whose work appears to have heavily influenced the emergence of Christianity, was a big fan of the term, taking it further to refer to the demiurge, meaning the creator of the universe. In 3rd century Neoplatonic thought, specifically for Plotinus, it referred to the relationship between the soul and The One, an idea that also appears in early gnostic Christian beliefs but is presented slightly differently than in Neoplatonist groups. (Note that Gnosticism is a very outdated term used here for simplicity. In reality there was a lot of diversity in what used to be all crammed into the gnostic box). In more orthodox veins of Christianity, it is the conceptual name for Jesus in gJohn chapter 1, referring to his pre-incarnate self as the means by which the world was created. It’s commonly translated “the Word”. 

 The way this guy is using it, however, is pseudo-intellectual bullshit he heard from his pastor that probably makes him feel smart despite not knowing anything about it."
36,Basically he wants gaiman to sell out to big businesses
37,"His wife or Ex-wife, Palmer was also raised in Scientology. She has some pretty eclectic music."
38,"Jesus himself won't force you into following him, but his followers will. Trust me, I'm a Christian myself"
39,I think you're onto something here
40,Now this is a conspiracy theory I can get behind!
41,They do lmao
42,No who is he?
43,Can't wait for the reactions to Good Omens season 2. Michael Sheen already said an angel will be very much in love with a demon.
44,"He said “much”, not “at all”. lol"
45,"Why do you say ""NGL"" then lying?"
46,I didn't know that. Another notch on a long list.
47,"I remember there being a lesbian/bisexual character in American gods, I don't remember the gay part though. I doubt anyone complaining about him would've actually read anything he wrote though."
48,Why does he have to be?
49,">but his books aren't sexual

I mean American God's had a lot of sex, but it was still predominantly hetero. Unsure if there were gay characters other then the Djinn and the cab driver, and they were very secondary characters"
50,"Any idea is a good idea except the non happy ones. Those we push down deep inside where you'll never, ever, ever, EVER FIND THEM!"
51,"That’s correct, logos is usually identified with the person of Christ. It’s also used by pseudo intellectuals to appear knowledgeable simply because it’s Greek (a language they never studied)."
52,"The bible is literally a book documenting Jesus's morally depraved exploits using violent force. plus, coercion is still force. jesus is the example his followers emulate when they force people. Jesus is an abusive boyfriend"
53,"Really well known British writer/novelist. He wrote Good Omens, Sandman, American Gods, and numerous other comics and books and screenplays that you’ve probably heard of.

He’s a very well respected writer, and is well-known for having really good representation in his stories."
54,Oh true
55,Are you accusing me of lying ya creature?
56,"I don’t think they’ve read those books either. That’s why I’m going hang onto my theory of it being about the name, because that amuses me instead of being homophobically depressing."
57,I'm guessing it's a play on his last name.
58,Sure.
59,Fight me.
