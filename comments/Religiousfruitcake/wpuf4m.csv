1,There is a difference in believing and knowing.
2,"‚ÄúA cabal of satanic pedophiles‚Äù isn‚Äôt there like, hella pedophilia in the church?"
3,I wonder if they purposefully got the rainbow colours out of order or if that was just a happy little accident for them.
4,Jesus said he would return within a generation. That was 2000 years ago and we're still waiting.
5,"Are we not gonna talk more about ""democracy isn't real?""

Like, out of everything, that's the most alarming. They're outright saying that they don't care if the rest of the country disagrees, it should be their way or the highway."
6,"I'm a Christian and I have to issue a hard ""yikes"" at this nonsense."
7,"They can add to the list:

Tinfoil hats are an attractive sartorial choice."
8,Im assuming they dont realy post memes but propaganda with funny faces in the background?
9,"But Jesus wasn't god, he was the SON of god according to christianity. Hell, im an atheist and know more shit."
10,"> Jesus is god

Is, I think, heresy in a lot of Christian denomination..."
11,"""Evolution is fake""

Proof: This book from hundreds of years ago which contains fairy tales and random stories for children that I as an adult believe are true."
12,"At least they believe in pronouns?

Maybe the bar is being set too low....."
13,"The Earth is flat.
Birds aren‚Äôt real.
Etc, etc, etc."
14,"That's a lot of words just to say ""we are insane""."
15,"To be fair to them, democracy in the US and UK is an illusion....
We have the most antidemocratic and broken voting systems of the western world.

But 1/5 is a poor ratio"
16,Reads like satire or self aware wolf material
17,"In this house we are traitorous, delusional, misogynistic, fanatical and perfidious. 

Got it."
18,It's a free country. Believe whatever idiotic nonsense you want to believe.
19,Christians meme?
20,Ive seen a few of the sane version of these and have been wanting one fir my new house. Havent looked hard yet but this is great. I will leave and not return the clippers i borrowed
21,At least they admit that they believe that democracy is bad idea.
22,Rainbow colors tho ‚Ä¶? Hmmmm
23,"Evolution is fake, yet there are bacteria who can eat nylon and plastic, and we have domesticated cats and dogs"
24,"A cabal of Satanic pedophiles rule the earth. 

Good point. Seems that the following churches definitely support, groom and protect pedophiles:

Catholic Church, Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, JW's, South Baptist Convention, Quiverfulls, FLDS, so on and so forth. 

So hey - they have a point."
25,Is cabal spelled with a k or a c
26,"Cool, so they openly and literally don't believe in democracy now. Coz the alternatives ain't great."
27,Sad for these imbeciles that hopes and feelings clash with FACTS ....
28,"I just find it funny all these churches and people have pics of super white Jesus in their homes when he was born in Israel, fuckin nuts that‚Äôs even a thing"
29,They should stop voting then
30,"Toilets are a conspiracy, shit your pants"
31,Anyone could've made that and I'm not going to upvote it to spread it.
32,The dirst 2 do have some truth to them
33,They had me with the first 2 ngl. Satanic threw me off though.
34,"Right. Believe whatever you want, doesn‚Äôt make it true."
35,"Their point is that the pedophiles in the church are not Satanists though. Big difference, at least to them."
36,The irony that I think the Satanists would be against pedophiles since they are humanitarian and all that...
37,Breaking news on my phone this morning that dozens of priests have been accused of sexual assault in Quebec.
38,ü§∑üèªwho understands christians?
39,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Satanic Pedophiles on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."
40,It‚Äôs called projection
41,You give them far too much credit
42,"We actually have no clue what Jesus said about himself, we literally have a compilation of unverifiable, secondary, contradictory statements assembled decades after the stories they are telling may have happened. In all likelihood the mythological characterization of Jesus as ‚ÄúChrist the Messiah‚Äù developed in the time where his stories were spread by word of mouth alone. Everyone was telling their versions of the story and changing details as they saw fit. There were many different accounts of jesus before the compiled bible and they all slightly differ in their claims and conclusions."
43,"""Democracy isn't real"" mf when I become dictator and ban religion (they suddenly think democracy is a good thing)

![gif](giphy|10UHehEC098kAE|downsized)"
44,"It's also way more stupidly phrased than the others, because it's not even like saying the **actual phenomena** of evolution is fake, it's saying the **idea/concept** of democracy it's fake, which is so much odder"
45,"Yeah they do post memes as well but they are usually like this. It seems like the owner of the page lifts weights so it‚Äôs all about jesus christ and heavy lifting, it‚Äôs super cringe but I follow him just to see what else they post."
46,Which ones are the sane versions?
47,Ooooooh I see that makes it okay cause it‚Äôs the church and the church is infallible/s
48,Damn that‚Äôs crazy how that works.
49,‚ÄúWonder‚Äù meaning uncertain.
50,"Don't worry, I've never taken the bible literally"
51,"What is this GIF, damn"
52,"I mean, if he actually followed the teachings of Jesus and worked out all the time I'd be cool with that. Like a swole apostle helping the elderly carry groceries and shit."
53,"All the logical opposite that this is reacting too. 
""In this house we believe that science is real. Black lives matter...."" and so on. With raindow lettering on a black board."
54,I know I‚Äôm just certain about them not being capable of it
