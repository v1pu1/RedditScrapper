1,"I'm pretty sure their ""morals"" don't align with mine."
2,"It's pretty genius. Probably the quickest way to make money is to write pro Christian or pro right wing propaganda. They are a ruthlessly supportive tribe. You don't have to do anything but make up lies and talk about how the other side is trying to ruin our future and how we just want to bring back the good ole days. No plan needed, just lies speculation and buzz words."
