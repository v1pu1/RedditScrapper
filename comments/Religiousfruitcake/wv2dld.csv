3,If everyone knew what these two boys do behind closed doors..
4,"Just a bunch of Christian extremists that waltzed on my campus. In retaliation tho, people walked out with a gay pride flag ðŸ˜Œ"
5,Fake Christian wouldnâ€™t that be all of them bc there is no god.
6,I will agree not to fake being a Christian if I ever go there.

8,Where is this place I need to avoid?
9,If that is so then these fan boys have to go home.  Only people living where Jesus lived at that time and believed in what he was saying are Christians.

11,Do they think they're some henchmen for Jesus? Do they realize they'll have to kneel down to him too if that's what they're telling?
12,"Shhhh, let them figure it out."
13,Basically anyone who doesnâ€™t align to their own specific sects beliefs
