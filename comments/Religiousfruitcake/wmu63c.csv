1,That‚Äôs an awfully nice deity you have there.
2,I guess we are also 'Cannibals' too when shallowing c*m during blowjobs lmfao
3,"This person seems to be missing about half their chromosomes, so I see why they think a sperm is a kindred spirit.  Also, don't forget that if you say this, you'd have to argue menstruation is murder too"
4,"Hey fellow men and those who ejaculate, let's all get together and beat one out to commit a genocide greater than those of old. That'll really show these zealots who's in charge! Who's with me?"
5,Well... Getting pregnant is millions unborn souls minus 1.
6,If this is true than I'm responsible for condemning trillions of souls to hell. Satan owes me big time.
7,Whoops.. Guess I've commited genocide then. Lmfao . . like whut?!
8,I can't believe grown-up people do believe in this shit
9,Every sperm is sacred!
10,"Okay, after ""Life begins at fertilization"" now comes ""Life begins in your balls""."
11,"Monty Python sang it best!

And now that song will be stuck in my head for the day!"
12,"Actually even if a woman gets pregnant, thats only 1 single sperm. Millions of babies still die. God is such a genocidal dick."
13,"STRAIGHT TO HELL, YOU HEAR, STRAIGHT TO HELL"
14,Surely this is satire.
15,"Kind of a silly logic to say that sperm have souls pre-loaded into them, and that jacking it or having recreational sex damns a bunch of souls to Hell. Like, what about all the little guys who didn't make it to the egg? Are they in Hell too?"
16,Literally every teenage boy: evil_laugh.mp3
17,"Procreation for soldiers isn‚Äôt what mothers even want to hear once nor intend.

I‚Äôll argue all day about this to god & I double dare him to try make this ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù!"
18,Why tf does christ need an army of babies
19,Well shit... i been keepin hell stocked full since the day I discovered the internet
20,"Then every time you have sex, assuming the woman gets pregnant, then all but one of them end up dying anyways. In that case, total lifelong abstinence is the only moral choice. But also, a woman loses and egg every time she menstruates,  so it‚Äôs passive murder! The only way to stop unborn-murdering is to kill all women and castrate all men!"
21,What a weak little god to need all these human soldiers.
22,No doubt the lady who posted this is an absolute whore and a cum gobbler.
23,I see the image and immediately thought of Sparta.
24,So like 99.9999% of people in hell either have Turner syndrome or... I don't even know what you'd be like if you just had a Y chromosome and I'm not even sure it makes sense lol
25,Christ sounds like a fascist.
26,I love sending unborn souls to hell
27,"Well at least they have beer there, and probably rock music too.  Count me in."
28,I think this is counter-crazy to the pro-birth(pro-life) movement.
29,">unborn  
>  
>soul

pick one"
30,"So EACH sperm is a life now? Which is it fruitcakes?

Is fertilization ‚Äòa life,‚Äô or is each gamete a life?"
31,"so unborn children aren't innocent

and they're saying every time someone has sex, millions of children die anyway

and menstruation is murder too

they didn't even try to think this through"
32,Are we back to Preformationism now?
33,"Having a child is only one kid spared by that logic, no?"
34,"Actually they are being wasted because they can't fertilize the egg, so those 99.99 million unborn babies go to hell directly. Nice ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
35,"Get a vasectomy, then they aren't going anywhere."
36,Now I have to live with the guilt of the billions of souls I have killed by my self over the years.
37,"Every sperm is sacred  
Every sperm is great  
If a sperm is wasted  
God gets quite irate"
38,"On the ‚Äòbright side‚Äô finally a person that treats the abortion ‚Äúcontroverse‚Äù logically.If a fetus is a living human, so is sperm , let‚Äôs ban jerking off!"
39,"‚ÄúCool, More friends for Satan.‚Äù

*WAIT!: Does this mean every time I have my period & not a child- Does that ALSO mean an unborn child lacking the male sperm to ‚Äòclassify it as a child‚Äô ALSO goes to hell? üßêüßê 

F to Christianity"
40,Actually the Republican platform
41,"What a loving god, to construct a universe where unimaginable torture occurs for so many who never deserved it. And what's even more loving, he watches this all unfold while doing nothing to stop it, despite how he could stop it in the blink of an eye. Hallelujah! /s"
42,"As if ""millions"" didnt die during normal sex"
43,Wait until they find out that only one sperm cell makes it to the egg cell.
44,"Oh my sweet loving **wat**, this is ridiculous."
45,*I command legions*
46,"Ah yes, that time Lord Lucifer got God drunk and tricked him into a covenant that every sperm cell that doesn‚Äôt turn into a baby becomes instead a soul for Hell."
47,So don't use a condom and have only 999999 go to hell!
48,So when I swallow then I‚Äôm a cannibal?
49,"""Every sperm is sacred, every sperm is great, if a sperm gets wasted, god gets quite irate..."""
50,"I mean, at least they're putting the onus on the man for once, I guess."
51,![gif](giphy|4baoNZ5Qo8dX2)
52,Why do they go to hell tho ..?
53,Why the hell would the intent matter? All but one sperm is wasted even when resulting in a fertilized egg.
54,Every child born is a millions of children sent to hell. Better stop having kids altogether then or you're condoning infant sacrifice.
55,Dope!!!
56,"Even if an ejaculation results in a baby, that's only one baby for many millions upon billions of babies (sperm) murdered. Shouldn't every man just be punished for ejaculating ever at all?"
57,Sounds like the sperm's problem. I also thought fetus and stuff went straight to heaven but ok
58,"So even if you have reproductive sex, all the ‚Äúsouls‚Äù that didn‚Äôt make it to the ovary first still go to hell? I guess their sin was not being fast enough. A sin worthy of eternal damnation."
59,"Being the sadist asshole I am, I'll be busting a nut to this image."
60,"*creating new* ***soldiers***

hmmmmm"
61,"I also got a question about that.

If god ""creates"" babies who are born with a deathly disease just to ""test"" the parent. Isn't god the murderer? Isn't that worse than abortion? Well, guess he got his own VIP pass for that then."
62,"Yea I‚Äôm sorry but if your god would send souls to hell before they even had bodies, let alone minds to think and understand the so-called ‚Äúchoice‚Äù between Heaven and hell, he‚Äôs a shit god and I wouldn‚Äôt worship him even if he was real"
63,"I mean the amount of sperm produced is the same, no matter if it dies outside the body or inside the body... So ""millions of souls"" die no matter what."
64,They are not saying that but they are also not NOT saying that souls come from my balls.
65,Imagine someone been followed by all his souls xd
66,"And what? With that logic, when they do procreate, about 150 millon to 750 million souls still going to hell"
67,So what I‚Äôm hearing is every time I whack one out I send millions of souls to hell.
68,No wonder why the devil wins.
69,Someone with decently good artistic abilities took the time to draw scared babies escaping from a condom. These people are sick
70,All the unborn children go to hell? I‚Äôll be in good company then
71,"Jeez, that makes God some kind of a fucked-up asshole, doesn't it?"
72,"They seem to be completely missing the fact that even if every ejaculation was during sex with a woman who was at the right part of her cycle and it successfully got her pregnant, which is not guaranteed, that would still be 20 million to 150 million souls going to hell every time.

I mean fuck, there would be literally billions of billions - quadrillions of souls in hell more than there are people who ever lived."
73,Based on this comment alone ... I think I want to get to know you !
74,"I like being a cannibal too, that's sounds great."
75,We? Speak for yourself
76,"Hell even sex to procreate is murder of millions, one sperm makes it and the rest die."
77,Now that Rick and Morty episode about giant sperm makes sense
78,"I mean christian procreation sex already is a genocide by this logic. Theres millions of dead sperms and only one makes the baby. 

One can not make life without ending many."
79,Gotta bring a shitload of toilet paper and tissue
80,"Cruel, but fair. They had their chance."
81,"Better hope you have twins or triplets so it's -2 or -3.

/s"
82,"Even if you have sex almost all of those sperm still die. It‚Äôs just one actually turns into a ‚Äúsoldier for Christ‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt really mean anything since millions STILL DIE"
83,"When a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate"
84,"Let the heathens spill theirs 

On the dusty ground 

God shall make them pay for

Each sperm that can't be found"
85,"If that's the case, why do they need a woman? They make it sound like THEY can singlehandedly create life."
86,Every sperm is sacred‚Ä¶
87,"I want to say ‚Äúobviously‚Äù because that would follow their logic, but changed my answer to ‚Äúobviously not‚Äù because they clearly don‚Äôt follow logic of any sort üòÖüòÇ

My head hurts."
88,Yeah this is definitely Satire. I saw a post about a woman who was arguing this to pro-birthers.
89,"But they'll die in the balls with a vasectomy. And if you never have sex, your body will ejaculate sometimes to eliminate old sprem... You can't avoid murders."
90,even more a sperm cell has a only lives a few weeks while in the balls
91,I think most of us do
92,"This wouldn't even be a problem for some believers.  I had one argue to me that god specifically makes people he knows will go to hell because if he didn't, some people wouldn't be convinced to worship him and go to heaven.

They don't care how many go to hell as long as they have their ticket to heaven."
93,Gotta crack a few eggs dontcha know
94,Don't forget plenty of lube.
95,They knew the risks.
96,Every sperm is great...
97,"Man, Catholics with vows of celibacy just can't win."
98,"So just fuck every day of your life? That doesn't seem healthy or sanitary. I mean I guess it's how things worked in the ungabunga times, but again, not very healthy or sanitary. And I like to think I have higher standards than Bogonk the cave chief."
99,Straight up Calvanism
100,Thats next level cruelty. Destined for eternal torture to convince living people what will happen by not being able to see you be tortured.
