1,More info here: https://www.lakotatimes.com/articles/missionaries-churches-must-register-with-ost/
2,"Good for the Lakota! Hopefully this inspires more of the same from other tribes. If the locals want Christianity, they'll go looking for it. Until then, leeches should stay in their ponds."
3,"American christianity practically revolves around irrational hatred \*nowadays.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I retract the ""nowadays"" part."
4,All Native Americans and First Nations should recognise that their civilisation was cut short in the name of Christ.
5,"Lakota leader: ""Christianity has not become a world religion through the quality of its teachings, but through the quality of its violence.""  This."
6,"""But but but them not following my religion infringes on my 1st amendment rights! Everyone has to obey my religion's rules or they're oppressing me!"""
7,In b4 Supreme Court rules that 1st amendment clause mandating free exercise of religion applies to tribal lands also.   !/s
8,that's great
9,Missionaries are still a thing?
10,I wish my tribal nations would do the same. These missionaries invade our lands and spread their Christian-Nationalism and bigotry like locusts
11,"As a native American, Ive always wondered why it's okay for Christianity to kill in the name of the Lord, steal land and gold, the doctrine of discovery, rape kids....you know, stuff you aren't supposed to do. And then come at a civilization with Christian moral and principles yet not exercising those things within their own civilization. I can see this shit today and no one calls bullshit. Even my grandparents who were set in their Catholic rituals refuse to see that, and that our ancestors didn't believe in that heaven hell type shit, it just one day clicked to tribal nations that ""I don't want to go to hell"", the tool of fear was definitely highlighted. Religion was used as an assimilation tactic to the tune of ""join us or be exterminated, and when you do, obey or burn forever"", leverage gained by the powers that be to pry their way into stripping a culture of their own respective religious belief, identity, and sovereignty, while keeping them impoverished and last to the feeding trough. I'm ostracized in my family and community for thinking this way and seeing it this way. I don't really care and it's not for me to impose what I believe. But what does cheer me up is when EVERYONE can get together and call out Christianity, catholicism, whatever religious bullshit for what it is. And let's not forget that a lot of christians live by double standards and that they'll accept what they want. They even do this to their own people, debates with abortions, two party systems, smoking weed, drinking, even getting tattoos, they don't want that and won't accept ppl.""HoW ThE LoRd MaDe ThEm"". Loving everyone and everything isnt something they want to do. They can be the most divisive while portraying a holy image. 

Also, recently some ORU missionary was killed by an indigenous group for coming at them with that bullshit. Why? Probably bc it sounded like a bunch of bullshit and they wanted nothing do with him or his beliefs. Kinda like how Christians did American Indians when they performed their rituals or spoke their language."
12,"i hate missionaries, they should be illegal."
13,I love the Lakota!!
14,"I spent 4 years in southern Canada going to a Catholic school there where they also teach Ojibwa to the kids who want it. I wanted to learn about the Indians so I took the class to meet them and get to know about them. I eventually ended up in love with the Ojibwa people, specifically Cecilia Whitefield... She is passed on now but she used to protect me and tell me stories when I stayed late to talk to her. She was the kindest lady at that school other than the blind librarian married to the mma fighter(both of whom were just beautiful people)... Cecilia took me to competitions to represent her reservation and I tried my best to support the team so she could be proud... Cecilia told me after I went to the school a year or two about her past... How they took her from her mother and home and beat her... They called her savage and heathen and would beat them for speaking Ojibwa. How she learned to fear the nuns and their meter sticks... She learned she was subhuman to them and they were going to beat her into shape... She didn't give me any details as I was about 11 at the time, but she assured me she hated the Catholics and their church and even the very school she worked for... The school they built on her people's land, the school they teach others to hate everything but Jesus. She completely renounced Christianity in her later years and became a shaman. I used her in my college paper on her people and talked to her on the phone about everything she could tell me about her people and their religion... My teacher couldn't even check much of my paper as my old friend Cecilia was one of the only person she knew of who was even doing work in their religion other than the man who started the movement, Cecilia's teacher. I have phone numbers on a college paper in case my professor didn't believe my information. I hope Cecilia passed through that ring of fire and is sitting with her loved ones in that free world her mother told her about... The world beyond the ring of flames. The world she was denied by men like this. I wish they had arrested him for harassment on tribal land and kept him in a little prison to sweat out this disgusting act. I'm beyond tired of these people and their abuses of the First Nations Tribes... They don't deserve respect or mercy, they are hateful monsters..."
15,It's about time to take the fight to them. Say no to the extremists who want to turn America into a monotheistic theocracy like Afghanistan.
16,It's almost as if Christianity is partially responsible for Native genocide.... hmmm
17,I see this as an absolute win.
18,"When a Christian zealot tells me America was founded on Christian values, I respond by saying, ""so that explains the near genocide of the American Indian and American slavery."""
19,Jesus Christ it's like we're fucking regressing. How the fuck is this still allowed after how much it fucked everything up the first time?
20,I love this for them. It is time someone says ENOUGH IS ENOUGH with these mentally ill people.
21,"They can openly spread their ideology but if you even whisper yours, then you are oppressing them"
22,"[Oglala Sioux tribe expels Christian missionary for spreading ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô](https://onlysky.media/hemant-mehta/oglala-sioux-tribe-expels-christian-missionary-for-spreading-hate-speech/)

23,I see no Fruitcakes here. Expect the Christian Missionaries.
24,Love to see it! Tell ‚Äòem to fuck right off
25,They should tell these ‚Äúchristians‚Äù to go back to their country.
26,Love it!
27,Wtf I thought forcibly converting native Americans to  Christian went out of style in the 40s.
28,Good for the Lakota!! Christians need to mind their own fucking business and I'm glad the Lakota feel empowered to tell them so.
29,"‚ÄúChristianity didn‚Äôt become a world religion because of the quality of its teachings, but by the quantity of its violence‚Äù - Eleanor Ferguson, Oglala Lakota and representative of the International Indigenous Youth Council"
30,"""We're about peace but you will burn in hell if you don't obey us"" üòà"
31,Check out his [website](https://jesusiskingmission.com/contact/) . It‚Äôs like someone set out to be the worst person ever.
32,"And you just know the Christians are going to be all; ""*Reeee*! We're being persecuted!!"""
33,"Good example, Wish we could do that for the rest of the country next."
34,American christians??? Spreading hate???? That sure is something i have never seen before /s
35,"Good for them.

Missionary people are just lying scheming recruiters for the Cult Of Hate.

If your 'religion' is so fucking wonderful, why does it have to be shoved down people's throats, and at the point of a sword for centuries?

Fuck them."
36,"Last time Christians ""helped"" the natives they forcibly adopted their kids and gave the rest disease and death"
37,"Yaaa, some good news!"
38,GOOD JOB GUYS now all the other reservations need to follow suit.
39,"Good! My mom had hot needles put in her tongue for speaking native in Catholic school. She doesn't remember any of the language now, but she still believes in Christianity."
40,![gif](giphy|LSk5aGh2WYL6g)
41,"Good, good for the Lakota. Anyone who can help Native Americans keep and reestablish their sovereignty and culture, please do.   
If the world lived as native peoples did the world would be a far better place."
42,"This is great, I feel so bad that natives were out on reservations then people feel that they can trample on their land and spread their religion, or that they have some right to that land."
43,Its fucking 2022 and christians still living in the middle ages ‚Äúspreading the faith‚Äù as if those native americans dont have internet and dont look at memes‚Ä¶
44,"I grew up in a fundamental baptist church. If you didn't, let me explain something to you that I am very confident you really don't *get*, because I try to explain this to everyone and nobody really seems to get it.

Fundamental baptists - aka ""evangelicals"" - are absolutely, unwaveringly convinced that they have an understanding of the universe that you do not have. The ""truth"", as they understand it, is not something up for debate; nor is it something they are willing to compromise on; nor is it something they can agree to disagree on. 

If you do not believe what they believe, you aren't just someone who believes differently than they do; you're ***wrong***. Not wrong to them, but wrong in an absolute sense. 

This is something people do not understand. These folks are radicalized. They're not interested in getting along with other belief structures or other cultures; those cultures and belief structures are, at best, wrong. At worst, they're the work of the devil and something to be actively opposed.

Baptist missionaries are not interested in offering you an alternative to the life you are now living. They are unwaveringly convinced that if you do not believe the specific way that they believe, you are *wrong* and destined for an eternity of torment in hell. 

I say all of that to say this. Good for the Lakota tribe for pushing back on this hate, and if you catch some of this awful intolerant bullshit around you, push back on it too."
45,Does anyone have the link to the video this is a screenshot of?
46,"Way to go, Lakota people!!!! This will make you strong and beautiful! You only need your own teachings..."
47,Most Christians only believe in  one-way conversations that lead to one-way conversions. They are not interested in your opinion.
48,"I cannot for the life of me understand why any NA would follow the very religion that took away their children, their culture, helped take away their lands. Good for the Oglala and I hope other tribes follow their example."
49,Good for the Lakota.
50,So glad to see this! It's only taken two hundred years!
51,Fucking finally. Native people tell the colonizers to gtfo go home nobody wants what you're shillig. Only took 600 gd years (in the new world).
52,Native Americans have been forced to live on reservations and now people won‚Äôt leave them  alone on it! Nerve of a burglar!
53,Christianity wasn't needed 400 years ago and it's not needed now. Fuckem
54,"If you are trying to convert people, you are an asshole. If you don‚Äôt understand how that makes you an asshole, you are being evil. Whether or not you get it, are willing or unwilling.

Missionaries are evil. 

You don‚Äôt think people should tell you how to be? You think your way is The Way so much that you think other people are wrong? Guess what, you were groomed and indoctrinated.

There is no way, there just is.

If you actually believe what you believe, making other people believe it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you are trying to convince others, why should I believe you? If you are truly convinced of something, you live it, not try to sell it. If it needs to be sold, it‚Äôs bullshit. 

Truth is found, not spread."
55,"In West Hollywood, Christian kids would stand on a street corner to offer hugs to reach out. I asked them why they were doing it and they said to show they care. I directed them to a homeless youth center and they said that it wasn‚Äôt for them."
56,"Imagine the missionaries pulling the ""Christians are being oppressed"" card while being on land the government literally forced Native Americans into"
57,"Holy shit, good for you guys. Fuck that missionary guy"
58,You can tell he's a psychopath by the way he clips his keys to the front belt loop instead of the side. He likes getting smacked in the crotch with every step.
59,Good!
60,üëèüëèüëè
61,"It only took what, 100 years? Imagine being *such* a piece of shit that an entire tribe was like yeah, your whole religion has got to go."
62,What a clown. I'm glad they're standing up to him and calling out his bs
63,I needed a feel good story today - thanks for this!
64,"This is wonderful, and I hope this trend spreads. It will certainly help protect the children from this toxic, death cult mindfuck indoctrination.

Or, in the case of Catholics, protect the children from being buried in the backyard of a church school..."
65,I‚Äôve often said it‚Äôs not Christian charity if it only comes with the sales pitch their religion. It‚Äôs colonialism and degrades the cultural value of indigenous communities.
66,GOOD FOR THEM. JESUS IS THE SHIELD OF THE HATEFUL IGNORANT.
67,Based
68,"Missionaries go hand in hand with genocide, colonialalism, and assimilation.  Creepy self righteous bastards"
69,"Good to see them fighting back. My grandfather was in one of the boarding (reforming) schools and it never sat right with me hearing about how he was literally forced to learn Christianity, and then he stuck with it afterwards. Such an incredibly bright culture being wiped away."
70,"""My freedom to insult lesser people and threaten to kill them all in the name of my god is being taken away from me!"""
71,"Oh white man, why you gotta be up in everyone‚Äôs business? Go pick up trash in a park somewhere, volunteer in your community or write some poetry. 
You need to live and let live. We are all over your intrusive nature."
72,He‚Äôs lucky they didn‚Äôt put hundreds of arrows in him like that other missionary guy. Ppl will ask for religion if they want it. Don‚Äôt peddle it it.
73,"Based

74,And that dumb hat
75,"I, a monk, sometimes my fellow believers for being fu_king bigots."
76,"Lmao this is crazy, went to high school with that kid. He‚Äôs really gone off the deep end"
77,They should tax them too.
78,More like the religion of the most basic lust
79,Then they yell this is America. Lol Rekd
80,only took us a couple of hundred years to finally do this. Better now than never I guess.
81,Yay!  Yay. Yay.!
82,Ho-wah
83,Go take your brainwashing and stay away for good
84,I love this.
85,Good for the Lakota.   I hope other tribes see this and do the same.
86,Why do Christians feel the need to ‚Äúspread the word of god‚Äù.
87,"Fuck yeah, gettem"
88,As they should
89,Now we wait for the ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù christian zealots to firebomb the reservation
90,Yesh idgaf i hate missionarys
91,should have been done decades ago!!!
92,They should have done that \~500 years ago. Better late than never I guess.
93,"When the missionaries come, you have the land and they have the Bible.  After they've been there a while, they have the land and you have the Bible."
94,"Oh god, the christians are gonna cream their pants over this"
95,"Good for the Lakota, and I hope other tribes follow suit."
96,Objective win for the Lakota people
97,I wish it were that easy for the rest of us to get rid of them.
98,Good
99,"I wonder how this will play with SCOTUS? Oh, just kidding, I'm sure the SCOTUS will allow ""Christians"" the right to trample over Native American rights."
100,"I would have given a lot to be a fly on the wall during that conversation... must have been interesting on multiple levels: philosophical, ethnological, spriritual..."
