1,Love the accidental irony of the picture also including a group of notably naturally gay penguins in the shot.
2,What if homosexuality was natural instinct?
3,"“Oh nooo, if I slap these two things together it doesn’t work! Therefore gay bad!!!” No shit sherlock no one’s having gay sex by slapping their dicks together"
4,Good thing humans aren’t plug in electric thingies
5,"Should say, “Instinct is natural, homosexuality is instinct.”"
6,This is happened in a city in Lebanon. There was a concert planned with several preformers and TikTok celebrities ect.... and homosexuality and related content among the performances came to be known so they cancelled the whole concert and replaced it with this dumb ass shit.
7,The materials your house is made out of aren’t natural so you better go build a hut in the forest and start hunting for food with a bow an arrow you make yourself. “Natural” is an absolutely ludicrous argument as not even the food we eat is natural anymore.
8,"But… my gay pal instinctively likes mens’ willies…

And in any case. Cars arent natural, buildings arent natural, poorly painted roadside signs arent natural.

Plus. “Natural”? What does that really mean? Sitting in a fucking forest clearing picking berries, eating roots and hunting dangerous prey whilst suffering horrific dental problems, massive infant mortality, being killed by minor wound infections and  exposure at 45 years old… that’s “natural”.

Fuck living “naturally”."
9,"How is telling someone, anyone, that they shouldn't be homosexual in any way helpful? They might as well post up that eating mayonnaise is wrong."
10,"""You should take your powerful extension cord argument straight to the Supreme Court."""
11,Just another day in the Middle East… I wanna know about that car with the penguins on it
12,Please tell me how they can possibly know that.
13,"They do realise things like marriage, monogamy amo humans and women being submissive to men isnt natural. Yet we see them demanding it every day and having to enforce it with violence.

In the meantime, same sex attraction is natural and instinctive."
14,Tell that to the dolphins.
15,"Ooh, whipping with electrical cords.  A little too intense for me but meh, won't kink shame."
16,"Ok, using the sex analogy. Why does my dick get hard to men just like yours does to women? Why does my drive rise seeing men and women I like just like yours flares up? Perhaps you're not doing something instinctually, or I'm doing something very natural and real."
17,"The person with that sign probably doesn't even see how ironic it is to have a man-made sign, with an image of an electric plug, while complaining about something not being natural."
18,"See that! Gays can't power your toaster.

Gay? No toast for you!"
19,This seems inaccurate. Where's the socket in the back of the plug that makes orgas...electricity so much better?
20,"Lmao it was always my instinct to be homosexual (before i transitioned, i mean). Never had a crush on a boy, ever. Never even thought about being in a relationship with one. This is kind of what instinct is"
21,"It's still so very stupid that it's funny, how they think being gay and going on instinct are mutually exclusive."
22,"""That's a persuasive argument. You should take your powerful extension cord argument straight to the Supreme Court. They'll love it there. Run it right up the ladder."""
23,"Tbh a better analogue is that you can cook potato waffles in the toaster. It's not what anyone intended but they're still awesome.

Basically homosexuality is a potato waffles in the toaster."
24,Does heterosexuality need a marketing campaign?
25,"Do they mean you can be attracted to someone of the same sex, but you're not allowed to act on it? 'Cos that first part is kind of not a choice."
26,"If you cut both outlet plugs you can solder the wires and make one long wire.

-Sincerely, an amateur electrician"
27,فواتير الإيدز على مين في هذه الحالة؟
28,Didn't notice until people were pointing it out lol
29,"It is.

[Trey the Explainer’s video on homosexuality in nature](https://youtu.be/Mh-HqCzEZT4)

[Homosexual behavior in animals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#:~:text=Scientists%20perceive%20homosexual%20behavior%20in,450%20species%20of%20animals%20worldwide.)

In essence, there’s nothing unnatural or immoral about homosexuality. People need to stop caring about what consenting adults do in their own time."
30,"Also, if we drawing the line of whatever ""natural"" is somewhere that somehow excludes LGBT people, then surely it also excludes extension cords anyway."
31,"False, It's called having a sword fight buckaroo."
32,So many cishets seem to think PIV is all that sex is.
33,"Don't you know? People are literally plugs and sockets, belt buckles or whatever. /s"
34,I mean I don't know what's on the other end of these cords but it would do something
35,I think that is a sex position altho dont know the name
36,"Plugging chords into wall outlets isn't natural!! BAN ELECTRICITY IN BUILDINGS!! BUT WAIT!! Buildings aren't natural either. 

BAN BUILDINGS!!!"
37,Muslim countries are so incredibly intolerant and yet they demand we are tolerant of them.
38,Yep I live in Lebanon
39,"Yeah, I hate the appeal to nature fallacy. It’s natural to bash your neighbour’s head in with a rock to steal his stuff, but it doesn’t make it good."
40,Nooo not my mayonnaise oh have mercy you fiend!! /s
41,They’ll love it there!
42,"I'm pretty sure it's just a typical anti homosexuality campaign, it's also in one of the shittier red neck areas lol"
43,شدخل هذا بالpost
44,"But, being gay is gay."
45,True. I always just think of gay penguins. It basically dismantles their entire argument.
46,"Usually the goalpost then got moved to ""Humans are different from animals!"""
47,"Homosexuality is present jn every species that reproduces sexually.

Homophobia is only present in one.

So you tell me which one is unnatural."
48,Oh definitely. I wasn’t denying it. That was an attempt at being witty about what the sign said.
49,"Or shirts, pants, glasses, hats, photography equipment, houses, most foods…"
50,I stand corrected
51,"What about eyeglasses, hearing aids, most medicines, pacemakers, domestic plants and animals, etc?  None of these are found in the natural world, but were created or modified by human beings for our purposes.  Sexuality naturally runs the gamut of attractions, and the consensus from both the psychiatric and the medical communities is that the entire range is natural.  Therefore, if we are to ban everything ‘unnatural’ all of our inventions, crops, and animals (except for cats) would have to go but sexuality in all its forms would stay."
52,"Lebanon isn't a Muslim country, this type of stuff happens in the part of the country I'm from and it's all Christians. This type of thing is very common in the USA, especially in the Bible thumping regions."
53,الفطرة تقول جنس آمن، الشذوذ بقول جنس شاذ يسبب الإيدز
54,But is it gay?
55,"No because being able to take a 9-inch dick proves you're a real man and therefore proves that you're straight.

Checkmate, homophobes!😎"
56,Can confirm. I love it
57,Christians be like. Those birds are pieces of shit sent straight from Satan they don't count.
58,"Well I mean, I can't see the difference between male and female penguins so I always assumed they can't either."
59,"Well then, that just means humans are unnatural then, doesn't it?"
60,The same could be said about incest though. Should we just say it’s okay for humans if animals are engaging in it? Weird logic
61,"My apologies if you thought I was correcting you, my intention was to expand on the topic."
62,Being gay is gay.
63,"HEY!! You can't get rid of dogs, horses, and other animals!! They're living creatures! Just because humans have manipulated their genetics doesn't mean we have the right to get rid of them. 

Religions are unnatural as well, so those need to go as well."
64,"Ah yes christianity is equally intolerant, perhaps even worse."
65,كمية غبائك مضحكة😂
66,Who is gay?
67,"ikr, REAL men have sex with other men (natural transfer of testosterone), beta males only have sex with women cuz they cant handle REAL men 💪💪💪💪💪"
68,"Sure, incest is natural in animals. It also results in the worsening of genetic defects in their offspring. If people wanna do that, they'd better be prepared to face that consequence I guess"
69,Not a problem. And I’m glad you decided to expand on that topic anyway.
70,That was my whole point; if we banned everything that wasn’t natural (living or not) the vast majority of the human race would perish.  The argument about what is ‘natural’ or not is meaningless given the thousands of years humans have been modifying our environment to suit us rather than adapting to the environment.
71,كيف؟ 70% من حالات في أمريكا منهم

74,"I said nothing about offspring. Incestual relationships are illegal regardless of whether the couple wants to have children (or even is capable of having children, really, like gay/lesbian incest or incest of males with post-menopausal females) or not.  

The argument something is natural because animals are doing it is utterly absurd. Rape is also natural, we don’t accept it, however"
75,I know. I was kind of being sarcastic and should have made that more obvious.
76,She's not gay. I'm telling my moms
77,"Rather hypocritical of you to take issue with me mentioning something apart from what you said when you did the same thing. I never said a word about incest or rape, but you decided to shoehorn it into the conversation. My point, simply enough, is that the whole ""homosexuality is unnatural"" argument doesn't justify homophobia, simply because it isn't unnatural at all. In fact, as I pointed out above, homophobia is more unnatural that homosexuality by a wide margin."
78,"Sorry, being a devout smartass myself I should have recognized it, but you know how serious some people can get."
79,"We must be related!! I try not to be too serious about most things. Today is my day off, and I think my brain went on a vacation without me!! LOL"
