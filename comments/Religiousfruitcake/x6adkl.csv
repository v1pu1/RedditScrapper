1,"Prove your god exists and ill repent my sins to him


The only faith i have is the faith ill need to take a piss when i wake up"
2,"Sure, they all think they belive in the right God, it's just so radiculous. Spoiler: there is no evidence for any of them."
3,Fundamentalists are the only people I've ever met who can be gleeful about the thought of other people suffering forever while also claiming the moral high ground. It's fucking disgusting to see.
4,Their god tortures people for eternity and they still think he's praiseworthy
5,So they think torture is moral and humanism is bad?
6,Religious people when they realise that the only correct religion was the nature gods of the pingo pongo tribe that lived 20000 years ago and the only way to get into heaven is by feeding your left nutsack to a snake
7,"Show me a god that will torture people for eternity simply for being unconvinced of his existence, and I'll show you a malevolent entity that should be the subject of hate, not worship.

Show me a person that worships such a god, and I'll show you someone who is at best mentally ill, and at worst as evil as the deity they worship."
8,"Imagine a child born in some shithole where his only sin is not believing in god and dying early to aids, is he going to hell forever?"
9,"Aaah, the religious chucklefucks who think somehow the 21st century humanistic morals are wrong, and sometime in the future people will figure out that the ""storybook written for bronze age people"" was the correct way all along.

Of course 21sy century morals are wrong, because there'll be better and more refined morals in the future, as was the case with human history up until now."
10,"Theists when they croak and they're just fucking dead.

&#x200B;

\*\*crickets\*\*"
11,Better start praying to allah then right? What makes your religion the right one? What happened if you got up to the pearly gates and it’s Joseph Smith waiting for you? Me personally I’d rather go to hell than heaven with Mormons
12,"It's the one thing that always gets me about Christians. So many of them seem to actively enjoy the idea that others are going to suffer.I get it, I suppose. You go to great lengths to deny yourself earthly pleasures so there has to be an upside. The thing is, according to their thinking the upside is eternal heaven. That's their reward. But it's obvious that for many, their reward is a maliciously gleeful contemplation of others suffering horribly. I mean, they downright get off on it. And that's as far removed from 'love they neighbour ' as I can imagine. They're sick, warped arseholes."
13,If there is a god then wage eternal war on heaven.
14,Lol at their idea of being morally superior by punishing and torturing someone for eternity. That isn't quite the flex they think it is smh.
15,"Not a version of God I want anything to do with tbh - a vengeful, malevolent bully who'd kill you soon as look at you and cast you into hell. Nope!"
16,"If your God sends people to hell because they didn't believe in him, I'm sorry but he has a very fragile ego"
17,"That would just make their god an unjust one since the punishment doesn't fit the crime what so ever. Sp a lunatic god, Satan was right all along"
18,"I've heard it said that given enough time, the human mind can fetishize anything. Eventually, given an eternity, Hell would just become a masochistic orgy.

Is it really still eternal punishment at that point?"
19,"Abrahamics (Jews, Christians, Muslims) worship a god that genocided the entire planet and commanded children, babies, and fetuses to be mass murdered and then they blame this devil fella and gay people for everything bad that happens. Go figure."
20,Still God's fault for allowing atheists to have free thought and reach the conclusion that it doesn't make sense to follow a tyrant that gives no concrete evidence for his existence.
21,"Only the most evil of rats find joy in serving lords that promise to burn and torture those who disagree with them and do not adjust their personal lives to their wishes.

Average Christians are delusional, but radical Christians are straight up evil.

They're the kind of people who would have pointed the SS towards the Jews with a smile under Nazi rule."
22,"That’s one of my biggest fears - that God is real and he’s just as evil, childish, inconsistent, and incompetent as he seems to be in the Bible. You can say he’s not worthy of worship, but I’d rather that than eternal torture

I left christianity years ago but sometimes i still wake up with panic attacks thinking about him Marine being real"
23,"It's funny because an eternal punishment is UNREASONABLE under any form of rational thought.

It's not a culture thing. It's a what the fuck is wrong with you thing."
24,Just discovered this sub and this gave me a chuckle
25,I mean why would god make me an atheist?
26,Says the people who worship the invisible sky fairy…
27,"Does God have anything to say about Hell? He can deny you heaven, but that's about it."
28,"They sure get excited at the thought of their god tormenting atheists for eternity, don't they?  Seems like it's the greatest pleasure they get from life."
29,"It's funny to me that according to Christians, god is so narrow-minded that if it got any narrower hed have an ischemic stroke."
30,More proof that God's sins outweigh your own.
31,Immorality is something different. It isn't even logical to begin with.
32,What makes then think victims of hell wouldn't lose their sanity in the first 2 minutes?
33,"So their god isn’t forgiving, then? I thought that was his whole schtick."
34,"An eternity of suffering is immoral in any time, culture, or place you overzealous dipshit."
35,"That’s your problem not mine, stay in your lane"
36,"It never ceases to amuse when religious folk like these reveal just how petty they are.

Emulate their Christ? No, no, got to gleefully fantasise about the people you disagree with suffering for eternity for the crime of [checks notes].... not subscribing to a system of morality a couple of thousand years out of date."
37,jEsUs Is LoVe¡
38,"Shoutout to god for giving humanity the rational faculties for developing moral frameworks wherein said reasoning inevitably leads away from his own framework.

Thank you, god, for making me smart enough to understand basic ethics, but not smart enough to understand why inescapable eternal torture is a part of the best moral system possible."
39,"Really, I think the only path forward from this string of logic is that god is *not* good, he *is* a tyrant, and he's *right* for punishing anyone who doesn't submit. The unsettling part is that many christians would be okay with this."
40,If a god is just then it would never blame its creation for not believing the craziest members of society.
41,Actually kinda funny
42,So god is actually the devil?
43,I think this is a shitpost
44,So Jesus did apparently not die for our sins.
45,"TBF, an eternal punishment for a temporary crime is quite immoral though"
46,Unless of course you believe in purgatory...
47,Ugh humanism 🤢
48,Torture != Punishment
49,I thought hell was Satan's place though. Or is it like a shared custody thing? Or is God just leasing the place?
50,This guy explaining for the 1000000th time how his god is an asshole and that he still doesn't have a problem with it
51,This is kinda funny tho
52,It never ceases to amaze me how easily religious people can dehumanize their perceived outgroup. That people who aren't like them deserve eternal torment is beyond disgusting.
53,The best persona game
54,Are they admitting god is in control of hell? So god is satan?
55,"I will fucking gladly burn in hell for etenity. Even if god were to be real, this kind of god is not worth kneeling to. I would believe and worship a kind god that makes themselfes known (aka there is evidence). Not this god tho."
56,"Infinite punishment for finite crimes is immoral according to *any* non-psychopath who understands what infinity actually means, not just 21st century Western humanists.

Memes like this are just straight-up admissions that they worship a being who they think is a complete fucking monster."
57,Actually I agree with this. Immorality is no evidence against God. He could just be a lying evil God.
58,"Imagine thinking you have a benevolent, just, all-loving god who will administer infinite punishment for finite crime."
59,"I'm sorry did they unironically suggest that God is a piece of shit by basic human standards and therefore should not be recognized by comparitively less significant beings as a God?

Deal."
60,"Lemme guess, r/memes ?"
61,"These people don't know the classics, it wouldn't be Hell, it would be Purgatory with the other Noble Pagans...I mean of it were real. I prefer Reincarnation myself."
62,"idgaf about eternal punishment, DEMON BABES"
63,Sounds like a frustrated hostel warden.
64,"[You send yourself to hell](https://youtu.be/HaJgLBoB_Pw). Duh.


Edit: [Another good one](https://youtu.be/RB3g6mXLEKk) (but different subject)"
65,"I don’t care if it’s eternal, if it is that makes the God in question immoral, not me. I might not be the best person but I’ll never willingly serve evil. Which is what hell would be. A evil punishment."
66,God can suck my dick christian jihadists
67,This meme is actually pretty funny. I could see it being made by a self deprecating atheist
68,Is this the loving and forgiving god we are talking about?
69,"Ngl this is pretty funny. Not in the way they intended, but still.

Reminds me of one of my favorite askreddit posts/answers. Was something like:

Atheists, if you die and end up in hell, what would be your first though?

Top reply: ""Well, I'll be damned!"""
70,"let me guess, r/memes?"
71,"Fun fact the very next line from Jessee in that episode is : ""he's the devil"" 
Pretty self explained"
72,"Bro, it's a shitpost, calm down"
73,Thought god was all about forgiveness
74,i thought this was funny
75,"I mean... I'm an atheist because I'm not interested in living forever. Even by the Bible's description, hell only lasts until like, the end of time, then all the ""bad guys"" get obliterated for the eternity that comes after. That's just no afterlife with extra steps."
76,In what moral system is it okay to torture someone for guessing wrong?
77,"Obligatory “if the Abrahamic god is ever proven to exist, I’ll become a misotheist”"
78,"I bet whoever made this meme, and everyone who posted it, rubbed at least one out. They get really excited at the thought of someone's torture and death."
79,"If God is real and I meet him, HE will have to answer to ME."
80,Satan throws the best parties!
81,So there's an appeal process?
82,"Imagine someone saying ""your god sounds like a tyrant"" ans saying ""that is absolutely correct."""
83,According to Islam I’m burning in hell for watching frozen🥺
84,"You know, many unrelated cultures have a concept of a sole creator. One thing they all have in common is that the creator is seen as kind and loving towards its creations. One thing that differs from belief to belief is the belief in hell. So if there is a creator, did some forget about hell? Or did some invent it. Surely only a human arrogance could believe that a loving god would submit its creations to eternal torture for not believing the same things they believe?

Hell is an idea which mainly manifests in places with many competing religions, usually as a threat. Believe what we believe or face the worst fate possible. This probably arose from frustration, a very human frustration, that others don’t share the same beliefs, and even punish them for thinking differently. So frustrated with the pagans who persecute them, they grow to believe that the only fate fit for them is the most horrible imaginable. And surely their perfect god must agree?

Ultimately, the idea of hell is the result of the worst human instincts, instincts that no divine creator would fall victim to. A perfect god would show forgiveness to even the worst transgressions, they would fix, not punish. Those who threaten hell think they are following the word of that hypothetical god, but ultimately they are straying as far as possible from them."
85,… so like. Christians just ignore the entire paradigm shift with the New Testament versus the idk testament and act like that’s the only time the rules ever changed ever.
86,"So you are doing good things in fear of hell , and pedophiles ,rapist and killers can go to heaven cause they belive I your  God.  While a normal atheist will suffer hell just because he doesn't belive your God.  Nice cult you got there ."
87,Can't think of the kind of mind space you have to be in to joke about something as disgusting as eternal hell
88,"Sorry I dont see a god using fear tactics and eternal torture with no rehabilitation as an ""infinitely benevolent"" being"
89,Spoiler. Everyone sympathizes with jesse and he is the most moral character in that show.
90,"They don't understand how proof works and don't care.  They'll just say stuff like ""look at that flower, it's beautiful. Therefore God exists. If that isn't proof enough you don't understand.""

Then if you explain that is still nothing like proof they'll just keep acting like they're wiser than you because it makes sense to them."
91,"Their god sounds like a sadist. A real sick puppy. Why would I ""repent"" my bronze age guide to life fairytale sins to an immoral oppressor?"
92,"I still won't

&#x200B;

They don't deserve worship"
93,"If they managed to prove their god existed I still wouldn’t repent my sins, cause for once a christian meme is actually spot on.

Even if god’s existance was proven beyond a doubt I would not worship him. The god portrayed in the bible is an evil, vengeful and megalomaniacal tyrant. Simply existing doesn’t make him deserving of my worship."
94,">Prove your god exists and ill repent my sins to him

I mean, why? Would you repent for being good? Their gods tend to be defined as monsters, there is no way to see them as goods. Even if they exist (I mean, if they weren't logical and physically impossible, and existed), they would be the bad guys of everything.."
95,"If god was real I'd still have no respect for him. That being said, I'm 100% sure he isn't."
96,"And after sex to reduce the risk of STDs, even with a long-time exclusive partner!"
97,They usually get pissed when I tell them I don't believe and then almost every time they stop talking when I say why. No good god allows pedophiles to prey on children.
98,"I wouldn't repent even if he was , I wanna go to hell to bang sexy demon girls"
99,"even if the christian really strange and comparatively ridiculous idea of god is true, which makes as much sense as gandalf being god, I would only repent my 'sins' out of fear. I try my best to live by the golden and older silver rules not out of fear of god, but because it makese sense and feels right.
 
I wouldn't in my heart accept their god as it is pretty much evil, so I would probably still go to hell. 

TBF nature and the natural law doesn't support the christian faith either, and can certainly do pretty horrorific things from my relative perspective."
100,Fuck God even if it does exist. I'm not gonna bow to a piece of shit like that.
