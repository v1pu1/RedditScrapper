1,"She hates the defund the cops thing, but wants to defund FBI just because of trump raid? confusion"
2,""" no men in women's anything"" I thought she was pro life? Doesn't a man have to go in a woman to make life? I'm getting mixed signals"
3,Maybe she can go back to school and pray for a basic understanding of the English language.
4,"Is this woman real? Anyone else never been able to accept someone so fucking stupid was able to be elected to office. 

Feel like she has to know she’s just playing to the most extreme of the right base, still I find it wild ole’ “Jewish space lasers” is really an elected official in the USA; guess I shouldn’t though."
5,"The creature is an idiot. Sadly, she's dangerous. Vote her off the island."
6,"Please avoid refering to this idiot by MTG, as a member of the Magic The Gathering card game we do not want to be associated with anything involving her"
7,That's really just a checklist for reality-challenged political morons. AKA right-wingers.
8,I always read MTG as Magic the Gathering and I don't even play it
9,"""Clearly MTG doesn't know"" fits for any statement she makes."
10,"Once again, from the “party of freedom”……"

15,My monkey brain: magic the gathering
16,"Uhg, this conservatives and all their weird neopronouns. Like most of these are just words, I wonder if Impeach is just doing it for attention."
17,"I see this shit and think ""edgy teen"" but our nightmare reality turns it into ""Member of Congress Adults Voted For"""
18,No Men In Women's Anything is a truly odd stance for a pro-lifer since if followed this would lead to extinction.
19,"""we don't support LGBTQ, but we will mock them using nonsensical pronouns""

Real matured for a politician."
20,She knows what a fascist is though because the image is staring her in the face every time she looks in the mirror.
21,"I very much look forward to calling MTG “men” and “Biden”.

But “stop” and “no” are also fun."
22,She doesn't know much of anything.
23,How about no too everything
24,"So hate, guns, and getting rid of law enforcement. 

They want anarchy, murder, and death for Americans."

33,Man/I/never/realized/how/much/I/appreciate/spaces/to/separate/words/in/a/sentence/until/I/read/this/idiot’s/tweet.
34,I'm out of the loop. Why are they calling for his impeachment? Did he do something legal? Or is it just part of the Nat-C hymnal?
35,"Neither do her followers. 

Just more belligerent bullshit masquerading as governance."
36,"1. None of those are pronouns

2. Almost half are verbs




Someone shoulda done less praying and more studying in school"
37,"![gif](giphy|MU5ZQDPTw1Kj1EWFKN|downsized)

Blessed be the fruit"
38,"""Bring back American energy"" because we need to get off that imported wind."
39,"Just remember, if a child sees a man in women's clothing, regardless of context, it's grooming. It might make them sexually confused later in life because they don't know if they were attracted to the man or the woman. 

(Yes, this is really one of their arguments)."
40,The irony of America/first being last on her list
41,Impeach's not the brightest.

43,"I can never predict, on a particular day, whether the right wing will go law&order mode or anarchist mode."
44,Why would stop know what pronouns are? Close’s clearly never went to school Bidenself.
45,"I can't stop laughing thinking about Marj coming up with this list - sitting at her desk with her readers on, tongue sticking out the side of her mouth in concentration, carefully selecting which color crayon to use next."
46,Abolish doesn’t understand First’s talking  about but maybe Drag’s trying to understand?

All while not realizing that she is one of the top 5 most embarrassing things about the United States."
48,"I hope a nearby flying astroid looses a small chunk and it fucking domes MTG right through her narrow little brain. (Don't worry, she'll live her brain isn't doing much for her anyways.)"
49,The irony of “America first” being last on her list will surely be lost on all of her followers.
50,"If this were just some alt-right commentator she'd just be an annoying reminder how stupid and hateful they are. But her, and the others like her, having actual political power at top levels of our government is horrifying."

58,Can someone edit MTG’s Wikipedia page and replace all of the pronouns with these?
59,"No no let's respect her wishes


One day, Greene decided to go shopping. Impeach picked up some bananas, bread and milk. Biden went to the cashier but when it was time to pay Purge realised DOJ left Defund wallet at home! FBI was very embarrassed as the woman behind Fire was getting impatient. Fauci left the shopping behind and took out Abolish phone to buy groceries online.

ATF got home and saw all the groceries Close had ordered had arrived before The had! Border left them a five star review and then Only went to bed.

The end"
60,"No men in women's panties then, I guess"
61,Im okay with defunding/ abolishing the FBI/CIA/ATF. She can eat a bag of small dicks though
62,Is this the GOP's policy roster?
63,"Alright, everyone! MTG has finally told us two pronouns. Only has made a big step and we should respect that. It can't be easy for someone so conservative to tell the whole internet two pronouns that aren't gender-specific. We need to stop referring to two using she/her/hers. Only is clearly uncomfortable with it."
64,no men in women's anything 💀💀💀
65,There's a lot of words she doesn't know the meaning of.

""A supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, **America** has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Trump won the election in a landslide victory that was stolen from him. **First** called for Georgia's election results to be decertified and was among a group of Republican legislators who unsuccessfully challenged votes for Biden during the Electoral College vote count, even though federal agencies and courts overseeing the election found no evidence of electoral fraud. **Impeach** filed articles of impeachment against Biden the day after his inauguration, alleging abuse of power."""
72,"""No men in women's anything"" so.... gay sex?"
73,"Excellent, I’ll be referring to MTG as “Purge” from now on. I’m happy for Purge, it just feels right."
74,“No men in women’s anything” is *not* going to be as popular as she thinks 🤣
75,"'No men in women's anything'? So I guess that's sex out then? Oh well, it was only a matter of time until they came full circle. ""What's the best way to stop abortions? Celibacy!"""
76,"Well, if *In* prefers these pronouns I'll happily respect *Drag* choice.

It's inspiring to see *Ban* come out and be *Prayer* true self despite living in a red state. I admire *In* courage and wish *Schools* the best."
77,She's just absolutely dedicated to being on the wrong side of history.
78,cant wait til her pronouns are was/were
79,"> In biden speech, Taylor Green responded that purge opinion was queen only option to restore the America energy want."

88,"Damn, put prayer back in school? so you're ok with your kids praying with muslims or are you against the 1st amendment?"
89,It’s like they’re all trying to out idiot each other so all the other idiots fall in line under them.
90,"What does she mean with ""Bring/back/american/energy""?"
91,start referring to ~~her~~ Biden  as Bidenself or Biden
92,Amrica first in the last sentence noice ideology tho
93,Be gentle. She only recently graduated from highschool.
94,She doesn't know pronouns but she knows her audience. 2.5 K love that shit.
95,"It's official, the Republican Party needs to be abolished."
96,Can we sign her up for mandatory remedial English classes?
97,Anyone else here think MTG's mom still has to dress her?
98,"""American energy?""

Ah, the old wingnut canard that America somehow was once energy independent, probably the second Trump took office.

Too bad for this fairy tale that there's this thing called the world oil market, where if someplace will buy oil and gas at a higher price, it's going there and other prices will follow."
99,It’s meta-irony
100,">No/Men/In/Women’s/Anything
