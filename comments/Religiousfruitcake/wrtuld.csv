1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,It's the ever-present notion that people can never be good enough.
2,"They’ll say it was the devil. Christians will never admit that in the Bible, their god created EVERYTHING. Including evil and sin. This is ignoring the fact that the Bible is fiction."
3,"If I were god, I’d be like, “Beat it all you want, and I’ll even add this neat feature that makes the skin on your dick sort of slide around so you don’t accidentally damage yourself. Please don’t cut it off because it’s super useful.”

Basically I’d be the exact opposite of the catholic god, apparently"
4,A coworker who worked in a nursing home told me about the priest who would masterbate while saying the “Hail Mary”. The ultimate unobtainable woman.
5,"Bruh, I was 20 before I said fuck it and just accepted I'd go to hell if there was a god. Used to furiously wash my hands and face out of feeling unclean from jerking off so much. 

The worst part about religion is not the brainwashing of the average bozo, it's the indoctrination of those bozos' children."
6,"Classic religious tactics. Demonize sex, the most natural and basic of our instincts, to create a sense of guilt and shame. Once someone feels guilty and ashamed, they will believe and do anything if they think it will make that feeling go away. This is how they take control of peoples lives. They also take away birth control and abortions because they need people under their spell to create more babies that can be brainwashed from the beginning that sex is bad, thus perpetuating the religion."
7,"I HAVE CHILDREN IN MY BASEMENT, WHY DID GOD HAVE TO MAKE ME THIS WAY"
8,All religion is cancer. Benign or malignant.
9,Hang on buddy. Rule 11.
10,"Catholics don't get cut though. That's Jews and Muslims. And it was adopted by Protestants in the Victorian era as a way of preventing masturbation, which then became normalized in the medical system of the Anglophonic world to this day.

Of all the fucked up things Catholics are about, this isn't one of them."
11,That latter part is actually fuelled by the adoption industry. They need babies to be given up for adoption in order to continue making money. Can't make money if babies are being prevented with contraception and abortion.
