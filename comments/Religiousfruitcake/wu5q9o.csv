1,"Why do Christians think they created/started everything when there's clear evidence of the opposite? Science, really?"
2,"Earth looks finely tuned for life, but life has evolved through millions of random combinations into organisms that work with their environments. Life is tuned for Earth, not the other way around."
3,I'm curious as to what DNA is if it's not information?
4,"“Looks”

“Looks”

“Looks”

“Seems”

“Seems”

Oh, but they don’t have faith. They just believe things as they appear without looking any further into it… not faith apparently"
5,This person is straight up using the god of the gaps as their entire world view. I feel like it’s a very close minded way to view the world if everything is just god; never admitting that sometimes things can happen without any influence or catalyst
6,"Let's address these one by one:

\- Life looks designed? I'd say life looks random as fuck. Evolution makes more sense.

\- Atheists claim DNA doesn't have info? What?

\- Objective morality doesn't look like it exists at all. Example, Christians who claims they'd rape and murder without Jesus. Morality gets equated with legality mostly because whether or not something is right or wrong tends to be based on how heavily we are punished for the wrongs.

\- The Earth is finely tuned for some life (99% of animal species to have ever existed have gone extinct) because of evolution. Also, pure survivorship bias. You wouldn't say that because the Rams won the Super Bowl that it was the only possible outcome.

\- The universe couldn't have always existed, but an all-knowing supernatural being totally could have.

\- How would you even prove we have purpose? Like at all?

\- Religion is actually the ones proposing that free will isn't real. Christians in particular claim god knows exactly what's going to happen.

\- Christianity started science? What? Just fucking what? Ignoring that the concept of science has always existed. Maybe they mean discovered, and even then this is complete bullshit. Even if they mean dumb shit like Newton, Newton being a Christian doesn't mean Christianity created it. Hitler was Christian, does that mean Christianity killed 6 million Jews?"
7,"Ah yes, “free will” is when you have to follow a bunch of rules in a really old book and everything that happens is planned by god. That really sounds like free will."
8,"People look smart, but believe this crap"
9,"Whoever makes this Xtian meme must not have ever heard the word ""counterintuitive""."
10,"ah yes, objective morality looking like it exists

&#x200B;

what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?"
11,"“Life looks designed, but it’s not.” I mean, kind of. It’s “designed” by random mutations that occur"
12,"My bread seems stale, but it isn’t (homemade bread can be good up to 7 days)"
13,mesopotamians could distilate wine. that is scinence. christians drowned people to see if they sink. that is not science
14,"Indeed, people were doing science long before their prophet got himself nailed to a tree."
15,Probably thinking about how his religious ancestors threw “witches” into lakes to see if the sunk or float.....sCiEnCe!
16,you know that thing that basically proves every single thing they believe is complete fiction? they invented that!
17,"Precisely.  The ""everything is perfect for us"" looks at it from the wrong end.  Conditions exist and we fit them; we didn't exist and have conditions fit us."
18,"And to some extend, life changed Eart as well. 21% Oxygen in an atmosphere isn't something that's stable. But life made it happen and is maintaining it."
19,This!! 👆
20,Yes! I cannot count the number of times that I have tried to make that argument.
21,"That one got me, too. DNA is information. It's not secret passwords from God, but it is information."
22,Christianity killed way more then 6 million jews
23,"> - Atheists claim DNA doesn't have info? What?

I think this is in reference to one response to the common religious argument is that ""DNA is language, therefore god"".    You can talk about DNA as if it were letters/words- but it's only true as a metaphor.   ""Information"" is a property of/result of how a mind understands the natural world.  DNA isn't information, but you can ""read"" it in such a way as to gain information."
24,"it means that christian people believe that without their god’s rules people would start killing for fun or even worse - be gay or something idk, and they are the ones who are saving our specie from such horrible behaviours"
25,">random mutations 

Plus the most important part... natural selection.  That's what makes it really *seem* like it's designed."
26,ಠ_ಠ
27,Haha
28,"Maybe they're talking about introns and exons? Introns are removed during the part where the DNA is copied to RNA so that part of the sequence isn't used as instructions for proteins. But there are still the exons which do code for proteins. 

I think they heard a science fun fact and just didn't understand it. Because it'd be like saying books don't contain information because there are spaces between words."
29,"No, they’re just being disingenuous. 

Please don’t reach to figure out what people like this are trying to say. They don’t know what an intron is. They don’t know what a gene is. They don’t even really know what DNA is. 

What they’re saying with the DNA line is the exact same they’re saying about everything else - if order exists, there is Someone who made that order. The entire point of evolutionary studies is figuring out how order emerges as a natural process in the same way a ball rolls down a hill. 

Don’t get me wrong - things like introns are very problematic for creationists and they have to get creative in explaining them away - but they’re not what these people come out of the gate with."
30,They definitely have never heard the two words “exon” and “intron” in their life lmao
