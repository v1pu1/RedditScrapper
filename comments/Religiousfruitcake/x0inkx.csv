1,"This is literally Blackmailing that's disguised as ""free will""

""Worship me or go to hell, you choose"""
2,Free will literally cannot exist along with the idea of an omnipotent god that created everything. Trying to explain that concept to religious people is like trying to fit the square block in the round hole though so it‚Äôs not even worth trying.
3,my brain hurt
4,"By this logic, person who was hit in the face can't choose whether to be angry or not"
5,"Which is it?

God orchestrates everything or free will!?

There can't be both, morons!"
6,OMG Queen Kristi
7,"Wouldnt an omnipotent god technically be able to both give humans free will and make it so its his will? If omnipotent means all powerful then an omnipotent god should be able to do anything, along with bypassing a paradox such as this."
8,This applies to most things scientific.
9,">hit in the ~~face~~ fact

Ftfy"
10,She‚Äôs my EVERYTHINGG honestly the key To my deconstruction
11,"Modern apologists will say omnipotence means that the omnipotent entity can do that which is *logically* possible. That would eliminate those paradoxes.

But it still doesn't address all of the issues:

1. Libertarian free will states that if you rewound time, and had no new knowledge, you *could* make a different decision. I.e., if you chose to wear a red shirt today, and tomorrow we experienced a time reversal and all particles, etc. reset back to their position when you made that decision, you *could* choose to do differently. The evidence isn't there for this, though. The universe looks deterministic. If you see causality, then libertarian free will makes no sense.

2. Theists often subscribe to the Kalam Cosmological Argument. The pertinent premises state that everything that begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause. But if everything that begins to exist has a cause, then your *will* has a cause, as the implication is that it began to exist. In the moment of a decision, that free choice you had was caused. That indicates a deterministic point of view.

3. If things are uncaused, then they are random. People don't act randomly, they act with intent. Circumstances, available resources, etc. drive much of our decision-making. Emotions themselves aren't random and uncaused either and make up the majority of the difficulty to predict human behavior.

This is just a few of the issues with libertarian free will. You still have the problems of evil and suffering among others.

But theists do have a point. If our decisions and actions are causal, then how can we lay blame on people for them? For me, I think this just implies that retributive justice is incorrect, and a more pragmatic form is needed. Remove dangerous people from the streets, attempt to rehabilitate them, etc. No need to punish for the sake of punishment."
12,"You can‚Äôt bypass a paradox‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a paradox lmao. The only way that would work is by changing the definition of free will and then it‚Äôs no longer yanno, free will‚Ä¶"
13,"Thanks, I didn't notice that üòÅ"
14,"The funny thing is that if God cant bypass paradoxes then that is a paradox aswell. Since if God can do anything he could bypass a paradox, but if he cant bypass a paradox he isnt omnipotent, which he is."
15,Which only reinforces the part where he doesn‚Äôt exist.
