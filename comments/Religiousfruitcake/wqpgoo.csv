1,So you can only sense demons only after you learn the religious status if some stranger? But sure you are good at sensing them it has nothing to do with your need to a a special prayer warrior who rebukes demons.
2,"Yes, all demons help carry groceries."
3,This person votes.
4,"Put on a sweater, dimwit."
5,"I was severely abused by the church as a child, it wasn't until my late 30s to mid 40s that I started to really see the damage that had been done to me. It took many years (at least 15) to un-brainwash myself and in my mid 50s still see a therapist. 

I met my fiancÃ© a few years ago and she has had little interaction with christianity and knows almost nothing of any religion. I have been trying to educate her so she can better understand my past trauma. She recently finished her degree and is working in the mental health field.

I shared this post with her. I received this response back. ""This is like having schizophrenia."" She was completely taken aback when I told her this is a very real part of christianity and most christians believe this to their core. She still doesn't entirely believe me. 

It's the reactions I get from her that really hit home for me. She is seeing it as a child might, however,  she can articulate her horror better than a child. She understands so much better now why I've always maintained that any instructions that come from religion is straight up child abuse."
6,I'm an atheist who worked in a grocery store. Got demons on alllll them bitches lol
7,Straight schizophrenic
8,"Worked at chick-fil-a when I was younger. I was in the bathroom and an old man came in all like ""a blessed day we're having, huh?"" I said ""yessir"" and kept my head down cause I *fucking* hated that job (and I was back of house so I didn't get reprogrammed to toss him off right there in the bathroom or some shit) and his face just goes so cold like outta nowhere, his hands still half-lathered with soap under the running water, and he says with a suddenly monotonous voice ""Tell me its because of Jesus. Say it."" I was speechless. I'm from the South, bible belt all my life, but this was when I moved to WA state and worked in that new one on 13th(?) in Tacoma. No matter where you go, these delusional bastards will find you. They will find you and they *will* do unnecessary things to make you uncomfortable"
9,Unholy water.
10,"Crazy he couldnâ€™t feel the demon before asking it whether or not it was Christian.. makes me thinkâ€¦ he ALREADY HAS FALLEN TO THE DARK LORD, JOIN ME PRAYER WARRIORS."
11,Pretty sure 99% of atheists know that if someone says some weird shit like this you just agree with them and move along with your day. We want no part of being yelled at because we donâ€™t believe in your particular sky daddy.
12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPnej4rlqt4
13,I refuse to believe this isn't a 6 year old making shit up.
14,Sounds like his inner demon came out to play
15,Exactly!!!
16,"Well where are they when I go to the store? Am I missing something, like a special incantation?"
17,And apparently is a licensed driver somehow.
18,Underrated comment
19,And they never miss an opportunity to do so
20,"Not replying for karma just to give a second account.

Depending on the church environment you grow up in the above statement is incredibly common. 

My most prevalent experience with it was when I was involved in a Baptist Church. It was not at all uncommon in youth leadership to hear comments about prayer warriors. We were instructed to constantly be warriors in prayer defending God's people. at one point we were literally given a bag with a scripted prayer and a rock that we were supposed to leave on her pillows after we made our bed every morning to remind ourselves to anchor to the rock of prayer in God. 

It went so far as to drag bus loads of us out to local hilltops to pray over the city in order to keep demons away. When a freaking bald eagle just happened to fly past the hilltop that I was on a bunch of people practically fell on their knees crying out Jehovah is with us because they saw a bloody bald eagle. Well yeah it's a freaking bird in the sky what a shock and we happen to live in an area where they are not entirely unheard of. 

I was also put in at least one situation where I was actively trapped by a leadership into sitting through seminars on how to forcibly convert people to Christianity in life and death circumstances. In normal activities youth leadership would stagger themselves around the group ostensibly to be there if you needed something but really it was another pressure tactic to prevent teens from leaving because you would have to get past at least one youth leader in order to get out the door.

As a woman the pressure was even heavier on you to be a prayer warrior. The Baptist Church in particular took more of a strong rooted stance in segregation of activities and gender roles in the world. So women were frequently told that the way they could be of help was to pray fearfully and continuously for their men and to God because heaven help you if you tried to actually handle the situation on your own. Got a problem in your relationship pray to God to fix it scared about a test pray to God don't study just pray. 

Ultimately it's one of the reasons that I stopped talking to a best friend almost a decade ago. Not every church is like this I have been in churches that are much more chill and relaxed but that's a bit more of the exception than the rule."
21,"It's that test: You with me or against me?  You might be the coolest cube in the ice tray, but if you ain't got Jeebus in your heart, you is evil. Even if they are the ones asking you insane questions in the fuckin' bathroom like that's a normal thing to do."
22,That is so weird.  If you were to do the same to him (demand that he believe something he doesn't) he would *hate* it.
23,"Is that like, Aquafina?"
24,"Nah, I wouldn't lie. 

If they get offender over something as simple, I would say ""I only wanted to be a *good Samaritan*"" and drop it right there.

Have some dignity, don't be coy and help an evil shit. Call it out in *understandable terms* and leave. You can be kind to someone *normal*."
25,Yeah seriously this is like atheist 101 you don't say you're an atheist to a religious person unless you want something to happen.
26,I always found being forced to say or agree or hearing people say so and so was a prayer warrior to be both egotistical and cringe.
27,You must not be pure enough to be corrupted by their assistance.
28,"YOU are the demon thats supposed to be helping with groceries, geez, slacking much?"
29,You have to drink the blood of a deceased demigod and ask him to possess your heart as a domicile. That piques the interest of grocery portation demons.
30,"They're all on strike, hell doesn't pay for shit as it turns out."
31,Thanks for sharing that.
32,"Right like there are designated moments and in the men's room there is no denomination. Except for guys that show ass when they piss c'mon y'all get your shit together.

Exactly right and this post is pure just *specimen* to boot"
33,![gif](giphy|5hh26QwJe6fuRSf7ij)
34,I get what youâ€™re saying but honestly it just isnâ€™t worth it. I live in a red area and if I called out everyone that said something pertaining to religion my throat would implode. It would also be hypocritical to push my beliefs down someoneâ€™s throat just as I donâ€™t like it when they do it.
35,I'm probably not
36,I definitely aint
37,"Hey, now, I gotta have time to settle into this demon gig lol. Best reply yet, though."
38,Deceased demigod blood seems to be in short supply where I live. Can I order it off Amazon?
39,At least they've got a union.
40,it's because no one asked you if you're Christian in the grocers parking lot. it's the code phrase to activate your demonic helper mode
41,This just in- Literal Hell is better than most modern American companies. Actually that doesn't sound like news to anyone lol.
42,"Ok, that makes sense. But if it hasn't happened yet in my backwoods Bible belt ""town"", it's never going to."
43,It doesn't to me.
44,you could like... kickstart it by just... idk... helping people maybe? just don't do the freezing cold energy thing and you'll be good
45,"Thanks for the tip! Although as hot as its.been here, the freezing cold thing could turn into a lucrative side hustle."
46,"oh snap, your demon powers are kicking in. you've now evolved to include greed! good job!"
47,"*Blushes and rubs toe in dirt* Aw, gee, thanks!"
48,did you just nail down lust on your first try?? unholy shit! you're a natural! ðŸ¤£
49,"When you got it, you got it, I guess lol"
