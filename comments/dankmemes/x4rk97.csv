1,Big chungus multiversus?
2,There was nothing funnier than when Space Jam 2 came out listening to the podcast where Jim Sterling explains he coined the term ‚ÄúChungus‚Äù as a portmanteau of ‚ÄúChunky Anus‚Äù years ago and happily watched Warner Bros. run with it with no awareness of what it meant.
3,What‚Äôs the bottom gif from?
4,"Well, he has appeared in a Warner Bros official Gacha game, so ofc they would, but still, if someone used the image of big chungus, they could still claim its Bugs (because it is an official image after all). That means you can't even say his name now."
5,My bet is she hulk gets canceled after season 2. No way firefly gets cancled after one season but something like she hulk goes on for 7 seasons.
6,Ah excuse me guys
7,This would be kind of funny if the MCU was in any way related to Warner Bros
8,How long until the the twerking she hulk meme dies out
9,I'm not a furry I'm not a furry I'm not a furry I'm not a furry I'm not a furry I'm not a furry I'm not a furry
10,Do you think WB owns marvel?
11,Can't wait for Big Chungus in Multiversus
12,Memes over guys move along
13,"Wait they trademarked a meme?? I guess cuz it‚Äôs bugs bunny at its core it makes sense but that has me worried for the future of memes, almost all of them use preexisting media"
14,But She Hulk is Disney property.
15,Chungus makin me rock solid
16,Warner Bros doesn't own any Marvel properties.
17,Please stop torturing me
18,If BC was trademarked by Warner... why do you think he'll turn up in a Disney show??
19,Pls mark it as NSFW I AM SCARED FOR LIFE
20,Pls bring me the unseen juice
21,u/videotrim
22,MULTIVERSUS!!!!!
23,What??
24,ok this one is acceptable
25,Biggus Thiccus
26," He's just fat bugz, and he was in their own cartoon they made, so wouldn't they have always had his trademark? This is confusing me."
27,that's like nintendo trademarking mario with a purple hat lol
28,I need an adult.
29,The undulations
30,"I mean it originally came from an actual cartoon, so wouldn't they already have the rights?"
31,Incoming the fat shaming brigade.
32,She hulk looks like the grinch
33,Chungus among us
34,A McD sponsorship
35,isn't that the yo mama Ronald Macdonald joke?
36,Just give loki season 2  instead of Shrek.
37,"This makes She-Hulk the best Marvel Movie of all time, even better than Green Lantern."
38,I expect it.
39,"If Multiversus had assist trophies, Big Chungus woyld be part of it."
40,I think hes already bugs bunny‚Äôs idle animation
41,came here looking for this comment
42,big chungus twerk?!?!?!?
43,Bugs bunny skin probably
44,Big chungus multicurves
45,"*them. Jim Sterling is non-binary.

Why are you downvoting me? I'm right."
46,Shrek 6
47,My nightmares.
48,She-Hulk Episode 3 Post credits scene.
49,ahem IT'S SHREK NOT SHE HULK
50,"That's not really how the MCU D+ shows work. Each season is like its own movie with a self-contained story, and whenever they want a ""sequel"" they make a new season. So far the only one that's being continued right now is Loki. 

""What If...?"" Is getting another season as well, but that's not really part of the main MCU lineup and is being treated more like a normal TV show."
51,"thats the usual procedure, 2 or 3 seasons...cancelled after 1 would mean a flop, something they are not gonna admit...but 2/3 lets it die down with too much investment and less PR loss of a flop, they just gonna talk marketing like 'they want to focus elsewhere' or some such shit to make it not appear like a flop"
52,I haven‚Äôt seen firefly but she-hulk is pretty damn good so far
53,Hopefully soon.
54,"but Marvel will own WD (my prediction for 2028, right after Lady Gaga won the US election)"

61,"Give firefly a watch. But know it ends after that first season.
