1,"Why does he always drive away towards Wayne manor?

Hmmmmm"
2,"I remember reading a comic where Bruc said something along the lines of ""It isnt hard to realize Bruce Wayne is Batman, it is impossible to prove it"""
3,"People of Gotham thinks Batman is a vampire, among other things."
4,"Would you suspect Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos fighting crime, If there were a Batman in real Life?"
5,"Please remember that Gotham City is canonically based on New York, with Gotham even being an old name for NY irl, there are (according to google) over 1 million millionaires in NY, not to mention that batman himself doesn't have to be rich, he have been poor and sponsored by a  billionaire/group of millionaires/company"
6,"And then there's riddler who ranted on his therapy session that it's obvious that Batman is a criminal who beats up other criminals, steals their money to fund his gadgets cuz it's impossible for anyone in the world to be that selfless."
7,"Batman actively tries to hide his identity though, sometimes he gives the dress to a robot or someone else and have them meet with himself as Bruce Wayne"
8,"Court of Owl exists. Apart from Waynes, Cobblepots were billionaires, so were Elliotts, Stagg, and Arkhams."
9,On of my favorite Batman movie quotes. ‚ÄúYou think Bruce Wayne one of the most powerful and influential people in all of Gotham is secretly a vigilante who goes out every night and beats hardened criminals to a plup.  And you plan is to blackmail this person‚Ä¶ good luck.‚Äù
10,They tried very hard indeed
11,The construction workers wondering why they‚Äôre building a lazy Susan in a cave for Bruce Wayne
12,"Others on this thread have good reasons but I havent seen this mentioned. While he obviously has some gadgets I'd say it's not obvious just how expensive and extensive they are for people in the story. Only Batman knows he is just a dude with skills and gadgets, others definitely think he has some super abilities."
13,It's simple! Batman of course!
14,I watched this enough times to notice that the snail on the picture in the background changes colour
15,"Fair. But also, if you live in a big city. Can you name the richest person living there?"
16,Look at it this way. It would basically be like if someone with a personality not far off from Andrew Tate were batman.
17,"No one seems to talk about the Wayne enterprise running for profit prisons in Gotham. And this nuisance so called Batman picks on random people doing nothing bad at all and sends them to prison. Sticking the bill of their stay to the taxpayers. A hero like Lex Luthor has agreed to help us, he is letting us use his Non Profit Prisons for free. Even permanently housing the notorious Gotham criminals in exchange for very little completely legal Generic Testing on prisoners."
18,these people must be relatives of clark kent's co-workers
19,u/savevideo
20,robin.
21,Not the government for sure
22,Clearly it‚Äôs that Oliver Queen guy. Or Lex Luthor. Or Lucius Fox. Or Mayor Hamilton Hill. Or one of the GCPD. Or‚Ä¶.
23,Hugo Strange: COULD IT BE............BRUCE WAYNE?????????
24,It must be that Harvey Dent guy. Civil servants are just rolling in cash.
25,I'm pretty sure he is just a soldier and the money comes from the goverment. The only way to legally use a tank against criminals
26,"Yeah, that's probably why they invented Batman, Incorporated to explain away this glaring plot hole"
27,"Shall I try politics  and use all those billions to fund hospitals,school and shit for free so Gotham is not a shithole anymore?

Nah"
28,His home must be close to the Wayne manor!
29,The Bat cave was like 12 miles outside of Gotham. Wayne Manor was in the city.
30,I plothole really easy to solve if Batman didn't park the Batmovie in the Batcave instead of the BatGarage
31,The criminals don't have to prove it to go after him
32,"It would be really easy to prove, a random accountant does that in the Dark Knight"
33,Just like Superman's villains know Superman's identity but don't reveal it because then he wouldn't be busy 40 hours a week.
34,"Bezosman, the first superhero to fight labor unions."
35,Not to mention like every other Batman story features some rich people party that Bruce has to go to because he suspects a villain might crash it.
36,"reminder, court of owls exist who are like all rich af"
37,"Holy shit, a **million** *millionaires.* Like 1 in every 8 new yorkers is a millionaire. Sheesh."
38,"That‚Äôs where the comic origins are based in but in the current continuity Gotham is actually Newark NJ. Metropolis is NYC.

Semantics aside, you make some very good points"
39,This is ironic right?

41,Bruce Wayne does that
42,This is literally exactly what he does. Gotham is just such a shithole that a lot of what he donates or funds gets embezzled pretty much immediately.
43,"Literally what his parents tried, dumbass"
44,Of course it's where the bat population live. Duh
45,"But isn‚Äôt the Batcave in the naturally occurring cave under Wayne Manor?

My understanding was that both of them were at the edge of the city, and people just thought of it as the reclusive billionaire lived at the edge away from everyone.

Since it‚Äôs at the edge of the city, such a crime-torn city, people just forget he event exists, he just kinda fades into the background, especially when much more prominent rich people exist such as the Penguin and Falcone"
46,This just isn‚Äôt true. The batcave is always under Wayne Manor.
47,"Yeah, Lets go after Bruce Wayne because we think he's batman and get beaten into a meat pie"
48,He is rich. He has a high fence and shit.
49,Thats the same logic by which a criminal has an edge over superman by knowing his real name. Like the fuck you gonna do? Shoot him?
50,"I think it‚Äôs a similar deal in Gotham but it‚Äôs also the fact that Gotham is such a hellhole that everyone knows Bruce is Batman but they have an unspoken pact to not reveal it/ not investigate if they don‚Äôt know

Because Bats is one of the 2 good things going for Gotham, in addition to the Thomas and Martha Wayne foundation.

Both go down if someone spills the beans"
51,Have you seen the bezos lately? He's training for something!
52,You kinda have to be to feel comfortable at all there.
53,"Yeah, it's kind of insane"
54,Of course it's in New Jersey
55,"Huh, didn't know they'd changes it, thanks"
56,"No, i live in the Batman World and am lobbying for lex Luthor üåö"
57,We can ask other citizens at the huge fucking party held annually.  You know the one where the baddies show up to kill Bruce Wayne everytime.
58,Not in every Batman version. In the Nolan Batman films yes the cave is under the Wayne Manor. In the Batwoman show the Batcave is under the Wayne tower which is in the heart of the city.
59,You could say that billionaire was quite edgy
60,"In the Adam West show he drives past the same ""12 MILES TO GOTHAM CITY sign in every episode"
61,Yea! Lets run right at the same guy singlehandedly beating our shit in every night!
62,"Bro can also throw unrivaled hands

1. Criminal enters mansion
2. Doors close
3. Nobody ever sees that criminal leave again"
63,My man‚Äôs got automatic sprinklers to deter any would be villains
64,The Zuck too
65,"Yes, but Batman and Robin slide down poles in the manor to get to the Batcave. This means that the manor itself is also located outside the city."
66,difference between going after Batman amd going after Bruce Wayne is that Batman will leave you paralized and Bruce's security will just fucking shoot you
67,"Oh, true. Maybe the entrance tunnel is just absurdly long as a diversion? Lol"
