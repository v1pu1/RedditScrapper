0,I didnâ€™t just watch someone die did I?!
1,Exactly what's going on with me right now.
2,"exams are the best, 1/1:30 max and itâ€™s your grade"
3,So glad I didn't go to college. I'm so glad my dad told me it was a waste of money if I wasn't going to be a lawyer or a doctor. I didn't even go to a trade school an apprenticeship is a much better option
4,He yeeted the hell out of him
5,Why nsfw??
6,"I'm doing my Masters right now, and I've done this so many times (this is my ""third"" degree technically), that it doesn't even effect me anymore. Seriously just another day, like clocking into work. Go into a room, write some shit on a piece of paper, get back a number."
7,"Um actually ðŸ¤“ school isn't meant be enjoyed, you just go there to learn boring stuff and work yourself to death when you finally leave school for good"
8,2 weeks into school and now Iâ€™m literally having a bunch of exams.
9,Yeah i hate quizzes
10,relatable enough that it had to happen right now
11,u/savevideo
12,u/savevideo
13,Probably not but you did see a dumbass in a small car cause a van to go into some trees
14,I mean... you can't even see the driver
15,"u did

that why its nsfw"
16,The return of the why-boner.
17,???? My exams are between 3-5 hours long
18,Where the fuck do you go to? Sometimes I have a 4 hour exam in the morning and then a 4 hour exam in the afternoon.
19,"What if you want to be an engineer? That's what I'm doing, is an apprenticeship even an option for engineers?"
20,"I'm in university (Computer Engineering/Robotics), and I definitely agree that people shouldn't be going to all these expensive colleges unless they have a realistic plan to get a degree that will likely land them a high-paying job"
21,Wait for real? My parents telling me I gotta go to college to get any kind of livable job in general
22,He dead.
23,Some tiny car with a person inside got sandwiched
24,Including said car.
25,A head on collision with 2 vehicles going ~100km in opposite directions and then getting sandwiched between a semi and trees? Good chance someone died
26,That ain't a van
27,I'd guess yeah what field are you trying to get in?
28,Welders make more than doctors
29,"I dunno, to me it looks as if the car slipped out to the front mid collision in the dust cloud. So he might've survived. I hope"
30,Im blind dont bully :(
31,Electronic Engineering is what I'm taking
32,"imo I'd stay and finish your degree, try to get an internship or 2, and then maybe even go for a masters.  A Masters in EE will reallyyy boost your income potential, but you def don't needa do it right after undergrad if you want some real world experience first."
