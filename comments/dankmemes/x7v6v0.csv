Now you have a reason to downvote me"
3,So called free thinkers when u/deleted shares a political opinion
4,Yes! I completely agree. It's like there is a mob mentality on Reddit. When people see blood they try and make more. All it takes is one drop.
5,🗿
6,I enjoy agreeing with the downvoted comments and seeing how fast freethinkers all the sudden have a change of heart
7,"No individuals, only the hive mind."
8,So called free thinkers when nuketown is an option
9,"*everyone disagrees with OP*      OP. ""no it's them that's got the problem."
10,"The hive mind is too strong.

Bread"
11,can proudly say i downvote on my own because my account is shadowbanned and i can't see any up/down votes anyway
12,I am completely clueless to the topic and my comment adds nothing to the conversation.
13,"Daredevil Season 3 is average and not as good as the first two. No, not even two. Fight me."

21,"or maybe y'know, they just don't like what the downvoted comment says either"
22,"yeah but sometimes, someone says some dumb ass shit and you just want to downvote it, even if it is already a double digit negative number."
23,Free thinkers when the paid thinkers walk in
24,👍🏿
25,"Redditors when two people agree with each other on something: “rEdDiT hIvEmInD!!!!1!1!1!”

Also applicable to redditors when they say something brainless: “tHe HiVeMiNd WiLl DoWnVoTe Me, BuTt [insert stupid bullshit]”"
26,"Thats the different between reddit and 4chan,  here you have sad people so desperate for approval their opinions depend on what gets upvotes and delete any opinion with downvotes.



If you get plebbitors to start agreeing with you instead of downvoting then u should start to worry something is wrong and animals are pulling you to their own level of thinking."
27,Deleting a mass downvoted comment is a sign of cowardice
28,This is the way
29,I think op is salty because he commented something stupid
30,like this one?
31,"News reports say that a man name ""heisenberg"" has been cooking artifial downvotes, to make the downvote market more saturated and inflated."

34,The reddit hive mind
35,"Every day, I just find out the stupidest and/or most controversial comment I can find and give it my daily free award. 

Well, not necessarily something extremely stupid, but something that at least *some people* can agree with.  But nothing controversial in an obvious way either, that just divides people (“there are two genders” etc.). 

“Why the hell was this given an award??”"
36,I usually upvote those ones cuz its happened to me before
37,👍🏿
38,Downvoting is the new upvoting

The best way to get downvoted is by telling the truth   



The great reset is in full swing and most people dont even see it  slowly evry world leader is replaced by world economic forum  members who take control of a country  my country included   a good example of this is [Canada ](https://youtu.be/SjxJ1wPnkk4)

Covid  food shortages  energy crisis and housing crisis are all tools to disown you of all your possessions  thay use covid (wich can be harmful not denying that) as a tool to get evryone injected wit somting that is harmful over time  and also to registrar evryone under a id tool to be able to cancel you at any given moment  for doing somting thay dont like  this comment for example  

The farmer nitrogen crisis in a few countries now is also complete bs  it's just a tool to disown farm land so that tere is more control over the food production 
Why woud farmers put so much nitrogen in the ground to the point that its dangerous    the farmers goals is to grow as much food as possible whit as little fertiliser as possible  because that stuf is expensive  thay 

All the food distribution plants that went up in flames  I dont think that's an accident
Water shortages  same stuf 

War in Ukraine   horrible  truly is  but it's just a way to destroy the economy even further  and it's working 
Immigrant crisis in europe is driving the house prises even higer than befor and now geting a house as a single is next to impossible 

Who got beter in all this  big pharma  made record profits  of the vaccine   and that are far from done yet many more booster to come and many more sudden adult death sindrome casualties in health people  

Evry new crisis is used to bring fear to evryone because scared people are easily controlled and that's the whole purpose  the ultimate goal is to reduce the world population to a point that whe dont destroy the planet  


This is not some right wing propoganda   the new British priminester is a conservetive  and stil a world economic forum member 

Woke agenda  all tools to slow down reproduction  
I'm not against LGBTQ people  let evryone be whoever thay want 


This is how you get dislikes  trust me I even trew in grammar and spelling mistakes for extra effect"
52,Why a ré you talking about political stuff. It gets tired.
53,Wont I agree
54,"Lol this is reddit that won't get you downvotes. Watch this:

Gender is a social construct, there can be as many as possible. 😊😊.

She Hulk is actually a very good show, its basically superhero ""Suits"" with a bit of action."
55,And then some!
56,uh oh
