12,"Into the comment section to see hundreds of people who share the same braincell, argue about something that hasn't been resolved in over 2000+ years. This ought to be good."
13,"Aight time to give it my rundown, before you bother commenting I really dont feel like arguing so im not going to bother replying. Anyways, God set up the world and its systems, think of coding a game where you make the physics engine and then set up world rules and everything that the game follows. He did that but for the universe, and then let it run while occasionally interfering. 

So he isn't individually controlling every single bacteria cell and made you get sick (He can but odds are most of the time he doesn't) it just runs, he's aware of each and every one of them but doesn't just sit there controlling bacteria. So on that same note a lot of people get cancer naturally, no god intervention, no anything. However, God can give people cancer as a test, and sometimes its not even a test for them but for their family and loved ones. I've met some people who have completely changed their life around for the better after losing a loved one and are now really good people, I've met some who fell into depression and no longer have a will to live.

But why would a loving god be willing to put people through suffering? Because in the grand scheme of things, with heaven and eternal life and all that this mortal life is nothing. There's all some sort of event we have had in our lives that we hated in the moment, it was miserable everything sucked, but one that changed us as a person as well. So now looking back you go 'man that sucked, but at least i learned from it' and it doesn't seem nearly as bad as it did at that moment. Some of the best people ive ever known are those who have gone through more pain than I can ever even imagine and they chose to grow from it rather than sit and wallow in their sorrows.

Anyways hope I helped explain it, or maybe I just made somebody irrationally upset, at least I tried."

17,"Revelation 12:9
""And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole worldâ€”he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.""

John 5:19 
""We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.""

For what its worth, the Bible actually says the Devil is control. Make of that what you will."
18,Most religious people somehow knows what God is /  does yet can't even prove it to themselves or others
19,For the 99 fucking times: this is the test domain. It's an unmanaged domain. Anything goes here. It's the GTA world without police. It's the free will domain. God observes only. And little Tommy who died of cancer is better off than your ass ðŸ˜‰

29,"Think of God as the examiner & us as the students. this world is the exam hall. our individual time is our exam time. now what u r asking is why did the examiner not give us answers alongside the question. see how dumb that sounds? why would the examiner take the exam in the 1st place if he were to give out the answers? 

as a muslim we believe God gives permission every singular action we take. the actions can't be done without God's permission. but God doesn't stop us from making those actions with our own will (besides the divine interventions we see happen in the past from our holy book). we have limited free will (limited because many things we can't choose, like being born a certain race, being blind, having cancer etc.) for which we will be rewarded or punished in the afterlife. the afterlife is basically the result of our exam. 

The examiners wants good for us, but he isn't going to spoon-feed us the answers."
30,Iâ€™m just gonna say it. What if those kids grew up to be murderers? THE PLAN.
31,So Joe Biden has a plan?

33,Reddit momento
34,the main point of humanity post adams apple is free will and letting everything happen on its own. I'm not gonna bother arguing morals but it isn't that hard to explain why it happened.
35,"This person above seems to be a real dickhead. However, the only issue with that statement means that this ""dickhead"" needs to actually exist..."
36,"Dank. But as a Christian, I am pretty tired of my people just completely invalidating and dismissing peoples suffering. Like yes, God does have a plan and it is good, but from our pov life sucks and God says it is right to be upset about it."
37,If this is God's plan then God is a fucking asshole and doesn't deserve our respect.
38,"ye but im pretty sure what you needed to write right there is ""little timmy"" not ""little tommy"""

47,"One of the many religious lies the so called religious people spread. They paint God as a cruel and uncaring person, while the Bible teaches things very different from the doctrine they espouse. Hypocrites"
48,"So if I rape you and kill you then you won't report be because it's part of god plan right? So if I force you to marry me and be my slave it's all his plan right? I'm just as much of a victim to him as you are to me right? RIGHT??? I CAN DO STUFF WITH YOU AND GET AWAY WITH IT RIIIIIGHT???!!!!

edit: it was a joke btw, to say if there is no free will then people shouldnt be responsible for what they do since they didnt decide to do it

religion is stupid"

53,Wow never heard that one before...
54,"There are two simple key concepts in Christianity people

We have God who has a plan and we have Satan who screws that plan wherever he can 

It seriously cannot be that difficult"
55,"That is not Godâ€™s plan as a Christian I can tell you God doesnâ€™t want you getting sick or wish any ill will upon us, he wants us to realise who we are and overcome the illness through his grace, the Holy Spirit can heal anything. You must have faith in his abilities"
56,"Because that was simply the way out was rolled. All life, even the lives of those that we consider to be lesser or criminal such as disease or cancerous are viewed equally by life. Living. And eventually, it will die as well. Whether or not it takes another or many others with it. It's still a creature of life and therefore, equal to all others in the eyes of life itself.

The deer may see the wolf as a criminal for slaying it's relatives, but the wolf sees the deer as unreasonable in it's pleas to deny it life tomorrow when it so clearly was unable to preserve it's own today. And to life, the deer that escapes the starving wolf and the deer that falls to feed the wolf are both acceptable outcomes. 

Is there a plan? Yes. Does it involve us? No more than any other living creature or organism. In the case of cancer, why should it be damned when it is a cell that simply does as it was made to? It may be and error in it's creation, but that does not make it less alive. Though my personal thoughts are to eradicate it, to life whether it lives or dies are both acceptable and not unreasonable.

Life, breed, die. Evolution is the order of life, the plan. We need not necessarily be a part of it. Life and death are the same entity, after all. Remove one, and what are you left with? A meaningless word."

74,"Interesting fact, God (Yahweh) was originally viewed as a god-king, one who maintains order. His position in society was that if the people followed His rules, then they would be granted an orderly world.

Only later when the idea of an all-good-God came into being did the idea of an evil Satan who subverts his will emerge."
75,"More like sparing lil Tommy from cancer is not part of God's plan.

If you learned that watching p*rn gave cancer to a small fraction of electrons in a small part of your GPU, would you stop doing it? Most likely not. After all, even if you did, the remaining tiny fraction of electrons who do still get cancer, would stil blame it on you, their god. 

And even if you went ahead and redesigned their little conductive iniverse to eliminate cancer entirely, electrons inhabiting this new universe wouldn't know how horrible it is and wouldn't be able to appreciate its absense.

There's a great quote regarding God doing things. Not exact fit but still. 

""How many would you have had me kill, in order to avert an action that would have remained entirely hypothetical. What would you have thought of me then? Humans have free will. God will not and I cannot prevent them from harming each other."""

85,Any one have gore group plzz add me in the group or share link
86,The whole point of the Bible is that basically none of this is Godâ€™s plan.  Thatâ€™s likeâ€¦. The foundation of the entire narrative and teachings of the book.
87,"Itâ€™s interesting that people continue to discover this ironclad argument against a benevolent god even after a thousand years of discussion. But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ve cracked the argument and blown the lid off this whole religion scam."
88,"Trying to explain something that exists beyond logic and science and that created such by using both is a terrible idea. We don't know why bad things happen, or why He lets bad things happen. Perhaps it is atonement for our sins, but then again, He already sent his Son to do that... Perhaps, then, it is because we exist in an imperfect reality, and Him intervening would ruin His plan to be a perfect being with an imperfect companion.

We don't know, and we can't even comprehend the reason why he doesn't do anything.

But knowing about something does not equal to causing that thing."
