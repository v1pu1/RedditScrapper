1,"I haven't killed 13 million people this year.

In a bit of a slump."
2,"Fuck bicycles!

Edit: in US, may not be a problem in your country"
3,"I'm only at half that, myself, but there's still a few months left."
4,"You have to kill 1.3 million not 13.
You are way overachieving rn"
5,"but why though? everyone on a bicycle is one less car on the road, therefore there is less traffic, so you can get to where you are going faster"
6,"In theory, yes.  In practice, bicycle people are hybrid vehicle/pedestrians that ignore the inconvenient rules of either and shit on common courtesy."
7,I live in a rural area where the speed limits are mostly 55 mph. Most roads have no shoulder and tons of blind corners. People like to ride their bikes at rush hour and almost every day there is a line of 50 cars behind one asshole on a bike. It's annoying and selfish.
8,"well that just depends on where you live and how the infrastructure is designed, here in the netherlands we have a lot of bicycle paths and other provisions for ciclysts, therefore these irritations you describe are kept to a minimum."
9,"but isn't that more of a problem caused by the infrastructure, and not really the cylist? since the infrastructure does a bad job at accomodating all the road users?"
10,"Oh sorry, donâ€™t leave US much.  Bicycle etiquette is bad in my town"
11,"Yes and no. There should be a bike lane. But, because there isn't a bike lane and people are actively chosing a mode of transportation that affects others. Plus there are some routes with bike lanes but they aren'tusing them. I'm not saying all bicyclists are bad people but here in the US they can be a nightmare. It's not really any different than someone just walking down the middle of the road saying that they have the right to use the road too. It's a complete disregard for everyone else and it's super selfish."
12,"well the US is designed for cars first, so its understandable that going anywhere by bicycle is a bad idea"
