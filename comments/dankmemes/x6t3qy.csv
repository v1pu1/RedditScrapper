&#x200B;

Marvel Fans: Well that just happened."
1,He's right behind me isn't he?
2,"They live an entire life suffering from PTSD and several physical ailments and die alone: ""Well that just happened"" -🤓"
3,"*your best buds brains are currently splattered across yours and several others face’s*

“Lol, I’d bet they’d pay top dollar for this down in cannibal island.”"
4,"*gets behind the enemy*

*whistles to let them know he's behind them because it's funny*

*gets filled with bullets and dies*"
5,"Hate to be *that guy*, but The Punisher (2017-19) had some actually pretty hardcore, very realistic combat scenes from Castle's time spent in Afghanistan. Jon Bernthal also stated he wouldn't reprise his role in further MCU projects if it wasn't R rated, so it seems he's also opposed to not taking it seriously."
6,"Enemy troops arrive-
""We've got company!""🤓"
7,"Man, I miss daredevil. I hope the mcu doesn't ruin it."
8,"Marvel fans watching their mutilated friend slowly and painfully bleed out in their arms after a frag grenade ripped off their face: *Well, that just happened*"
9,I have watched a lot of rough videos on the internet and a lot of them involved war. I've noticed that soldiers do quite often joke around except in the very heat of battle where you have to focus. I've seen a lot of videos of dudes laughing their asses off at the enemy getting smoked.
10,"excuse me, this is the fun-vee. the humdrum-vee is back there"
11,thats one of the reasons im not a marvel fan anymore. marvel used to have a good mix of comedy and serious moments but they seem to have gone all in on the humor side of it and it shows
12,Genocide & Jokes
13,Marvel fans when they are stuck in a one on one combat against an enemy and hundreds of portals revealing alien superheroes don’t open up
14,"""We're fucking dying out here!!""

""Pfft. Language.""

*machine guns rips entire squad to shreds*"
15,"Ha! I've seen the average marvel fan and you guys couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper bag let alone in a war. Keep dreaming you Thanos nerds.

Hell isn't that why you guys like marvel and DC? it's a big power fantasy. But instead of becoming powerful by hard work exercise and proper diet with correct training you guys read comic books and think that's a good substitute"
16,Foxhole fans: calculated
17,"„this movie was sponsored by the pentagon“    
no really. the pentagon sponsored many hollywood movies and offered vehicels, personal, equipment etc in exchange for the right to edit the script to remove war-critical scenes."
18,"""I'm gonna get that arm"""
19,"Oh there are jokes. Just not the ones you're looking for.

*laughs at Russian screaming in the distance from last artillery barrage*"
20,Sometimes you gotta force yourself to laugh. Otherwise you’ll cry.
21, “jokes”
22,"“It’s Nukin’ Time… uhhh that sounded better in my head. Wait, where’s the launch codes? They’re right behind me, aren’t they? Uhhh… Awkward!”- Kim Jong Un right before nuking the US"
23,Did that actually ever  happen  in the mcu
24,They gonna say YOU TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME and when they shoot they'll be disappointed
25,Idk if I'm allowed to laugh at this but I do want to
26,"Well, THAT just happened."
27,*AK muzzle pokes out of bush*
28,Is there a sauce for this one liner
29,"Can you please explain where this is from lol, I’ve seen it twice in this thread"
30,the realistic scenes added to the experience … idk whether the new punisher series will work with normal scenes and comedic dialogues
31,Barking like a dog is goofy but it’s also very on brand for Jon’s punisher. I mean that man was born to play that role.
32,and Punisher and Jessica jones and Luke cage and the defenders and (fuck you Iron fist)
33,"judging from marvel’s shows and movies from the recent years, like 80-90% of them are straight up shit. there’s a good 90% chance daredevil is gonna get turned into some disingenuous virtue signaling cringefest with tasless cliche jokes and 3rd rated writing/directing done by some high school dropouts who feel absolutely compelled to show the world their profound struggles and their newly developed understanding of the society. 

on top of that, even without the agreement with netflix, they still wasted years not getting started with filming while the actors grew older. the story ended with a cliffhanger. who knows if they’re just gonna dump it all and do away the previous elements. i hope they don’t fuck it up with this show. or i’m really not gonna resubscribe to disney plus again"
34,Im not an expert but it just sounds like some  mechanism to reduce stress.
35,"When I was in Iraq the amount of jokes was staggering. 

I literally accused my MSgt of being a cock holster for our major and he winks and jumps in the majors lap. Great times

Even when it got dicey (I was never in like ‘shooting at ISIS’ situations but plenty of mortars and IDF) guys chilling in a bunker packed with too many dudes chime in over the radio for accountability “yeah we’re good but I’ve got Frazier’s ass in my face and I’m pretty sure Johnson is playing with my taint-break…yeah it’s Johnson”. 

Find memories. Lots of dick jokes and gay jokes."
36,Even funnier if they told it to a higher-ranking officer
37,i give that joke a pass because he got a vibe-check immediately after
38,Bro you must bleed toxic masculinity
39,I bet you could one on one Thanos easily
40,who ruined your day?
41,This has to be a troll
42,Sup Tate how u finding reddit?
43,He probably watches Andrew Tate
44,I guess Chris Kyle shouldn’t have read The Punisher and just should have put that comic book down and been a real man.
45,Yes
46,Somehow Palpatine returned
47,I find it hard to take you seriously with that face.
48,you don't believe iron fist was worse than Disney+ shows right?
49,He does. Check out his profile.
50,Hey if you enjoyed jerking off and reading comic books I guess that's what you want to do just remember this is the internet not real life and comic books are for bitches. Not to mention marvel movies fucking suck every real director in Hollywood makes fun of them
51,I'm sorry I didn't realize telling the truth about a bunch of weak ass bitches means my day was ruined. And judging from my down votes I see I struck a chord 😂😂🖕 that's okay Socrates was executed even though he was right
52,"Nah, this guy is an antivax, flat earth believing trump supporter, he’s serious"
53,"""What's wrong? Something in my face. Am I funny to you? Do you think I'm a clown or something?"""
54,"Not really except Wandavision, but comparing bad apples with shit doesn't make em tastier"
55,No I bleed masculinity. toxic masculinity doesn't exist it's a made-up term by a bunch of feminist femboys who just don't measure up to the rest of us. I'm not satisfied with being a weak pussy. I'm also former infantry so I really don't give a fuck what you think. I've come to realize reddit is filled with a bunch of leftist pussies anyways so have at it bitches act like karma means anything to me 🤣😂
56,You saying you don't enjoy jerking off? But then again you're ex-infantry so you probably just got some of the other guys to jerk you off for you
57,Bro comparing himself to Socrates
58,Damn didn't know we had Andrew Tate stans still.
59,Lol bitch boi
60,He is on a mensright sub
61,"Yes?

Now go get your fucking shinebox!"
62,"just, you know, you're just funny. it's the way you told the story and everything"
63,Wich is shit and wich are the bad apples
64,Shut up spyboy troll
65,">feminist femboys who just don't measure up to the rest of us. I'm not satisfied with being a weak pussy

Literally mashing random words together"
66,"Ignore the Andrew Tate stan, not worth it."
67,"""you mean funny Hah-Hah, or funny kweeuh? NAH, I WANNA KNOW!"""
68,Bad apple is Iron fist and shit are the Disney shows
