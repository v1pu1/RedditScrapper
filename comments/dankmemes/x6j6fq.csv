1,"Nah bro, have you seen shops? Those things are heavy as hell, I could never lift one"
2,Are you a cop or something
3,Used to do the walmart return policy trick. $60 cologne and you return it for a gift card. I would do a British accent so the ladies would focus on that and not the fact that this rando all of a sudden doesn't need $60 cologne he just bought without a receipt.
4,I shoplifted your mom out of a whorehouse
5,Nice try FBI
6,I stole once. A charizard pin from a local comic book store. I still have it 8 years later and I still feel guilty about it.
7,I can't even lift myself Bruh
8,i stole their air
9,"When I was like 16 I went to Toys R Us with my friend and his girlfriend to steal some Yu-Gi-Oh cards because we were stoners and wanted to play but had no money because of the weed. 

We wandered around the store for like 5 minutes each holding a couple packs of cards trying to figure how stealing worked and finally gave up and we decided to put them back and leave. 

His girlfriend said ""You're both fucking pussies"" and proceeded to rip open like 5 packs of cards and shove the cards in her bra and walked out of the store. 

We never actually played the game lol."
10,"Honestly no, there were a few times as a kid I thought about stealing candy, I even picked up a reesie cup, but I didn't go through with it."
11,Not today mr fbi
12,Their battle will be legendary
13,Chocolate.I was 8
14,"Game CDs‚Ä¶

But to be fair, they were copying pirated games onto the CDs and selling them for a buck each.

How do I know they were pirated? I had to manually paste files from a ‚Äú.crack‚Äù folder from the CDs for the games to work.

Eventually got caught, never shoplifted again"
15,"Yeah, I stole your mom's virginity"
16,Guy liner
17,I took a three pin which didn't fit in my room's socket
18,Depends. If you‚Äôre in a liberal run city you can just shoplift freely ü§£
19,You can lift anything if you smoke enough crack
20,Do you think cops have a special reddit taskforce that is interested in what people on dankmemes shoplift or something?
21,lol...So you just take a cologne from the rack and take it to the counter with a pommy accent and get a gift voucher?  That is some Slipping Jimmy shifty level shit.
22,"Dad... is that you?

You still owe mum 20 bucks."
23,Stop trying to blow my cover!  It's bad enough they don't let me have a real gun and make me make shitty dankmemes all day on Microsoft Paint.
24,"The guilt probably means you're a good person, if it still bothers you you should try to pay the comic store back anon or if you really wanna balls up, you could  speak to the store owner and explain. I'm sure the comic book guy would laugh if you told him and take your money and you will probably make a new freind and sleep better at night."
25,Crack will help with that
26,You're breathtaking!
27,"That is so wholesome,

so did you bang your friends girlfriend?"
28,"Remember fellas, stay under $981!"
29,üíÄ
30,Can I borrow some? There are some shops I would like to lift.
31,Yes
32,You think they don't?
33,Sounds like something a narc would say...get him!
34,Yea man. I've since turned around though lol got a 2story 2bed townhouse all to myself:D
35,You're Breathtaking!
36,I couldn't even bang my girlfriend at that point in my life lol
37,"Nice job my man, that's a lot of cologne gift vouchers you must have hustled for to buy a 2 bed townhouse in this economy lol"
38,I'm not allowed there any more
39,"I was gonna say as someone with a lot of experience in retail, companies usually have a way of tracking non receipted returns so you‚Äôd be caught eventually."
