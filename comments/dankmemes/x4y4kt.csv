1,"‚ÄúBefore I rape you, can you help me open this consent condom?‚Äù"
2,That is ableist! What if I'm dating a one-armed chick?
3,"And if your rapist has four hands? What then, idiots?!"
4,If your a rapist don't think you realy care about condoms
5,What about 2 men raping 1 woman?
6,"Presumably, the idea is to protect either party in a consensual activity from being falsely accused of rape. Hard to see ""they raped me"" when two people were needed to open the condom and no-one else was there to help. Not fool proof, but I presume that's the idea."
7,‚Äú I know I‚Äôm raping you and all but I wanna be safe let me get my condom‚Äù
8,"Its a symbolic gesture and obviously not intended as a rape deterrent. They already have anti-rape condoms.

I imagine the condom is encouraging an idea of sex as an act of partnership and not one where the penetrator does sex upon the penetrated."
9,"it's not supposed to be a foolproof way of preventing rape. As the article says, it just sends a message."
10,"Why would a rapist buy this? Also, can‚Äôt they just use some scissors to cut it or something"
11,use a knife?
12,"Machamp, anyone?"
13,I'm sure some flexible person would open with their 2 hands and 2 feet soooo that's 4 right?
14,I feel like I've seen this in a series somewhere.
15,That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard
16,What times to be alive
17,"Incentivizing raw dog rape, because the DNA disincentive clearly wasn‚Äôt enough"
18,"What if they open it and then one of them decides they don't wanna have sex and then he rapes them anyway? Fucking dumb idea that literally won't help with anything. Also, heard of scissors? Jesus"
19,"Nothing kills the mood more than 'hey I need to uncuff you so we can open the condom"""
20,Do rapists even use condoms?
21,"Prince Goro, Machamp, and Pong Krell have entered the chat."
22,"""powerful statement""."
23,"This is an ancient awareness campaign, it doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore"
24,"# Objection! 

But how did he open the condom if said girl did not give consent?"
25,Late stage capitalism be like: poWeRfuL StATeMenT
26,Mine take 4 hands to put on.
27,"Looks like a waste of cardboard to me and a way of ignoring the problem of poor communication. And if a guy wanted to pressure someone into sex and was afraid the partner might refuse if they had to give explicit consent via a condom that requires 4 hands, this might deter them from using a condom at all which would be so much worse.

It‚Äôs a cute idea but it doesn‚Äôt seem very well though out to me."
28,Imagine the rapist has four arms üíÄ
29,General Grievous is gonna have a good night with someone. But who?
30,better call Saul mfs when(they better call him to free them from the rape charges)
31,"Basically you can force someone to sex, but not to open a condom with you?"
32,"Why would a rapist need a condom, as a true redditor I have heard bare back is better!"
33,Can‚Äôt I just rip the box in half?
34,I‚Äôm pretty sure no one planning on doing some raping stopped because they couldn‚Äôt get the condom open.
35,Your rapists used condoms!? üòÆ
36,Knife? Scissors?
37,Well it appears that no matter what I'm still Ranni's bitch then
38,Kinda pointless because you can choose to stop at anytime. opening a condom box is some magical Pandora's box of consent.
39,"I think I had a stroke reading this title.

But the idea is also stupid, nice thought / plan but very badly executed"
40,"Quick question 

What if I use a knife to open the box and throw it away"
41,"Quick reminder that while the mechanism needs 4 hands to activate, its made out of CARDBOARD and can be torn easly with 2 arms."
42,"The idea of the condom is that it invokes the themes of consent. It promotes consent as a concept, not to ensure it. The fact that it is designed that way at all acts as a reminder to the importance of consent, even if it does not serve serve actually enforce it. You know what does both? Never paying for your own condoms. Only use ones given to you. Stick around for more financial tips."
43,Also what if someone is an amputee like bruh what?
44,I mean it's a statement rather than a practical product.
45,"Has anyone here ever heard of a knife, cuz I‚Äôm 90% sure a rapist would have one."
46,I doubt rapists give a fuck about protection. And if they do well even if this was the only one sold worldwide.. its a piece of cardboard.
47,"It would probably be like
""Help me open it  or ill rape you without one"""
48,I‚Äôd just rip the box
49,Rapists use condoms?
50,I‚Äôm sure rapists could easily avoid this situation by just not buying these condoms lol
51,In comes general grevious
52,what if they just break open the box
53,Just rip it open what‚Äôs stopping them
54,You‚Äôre like 10 years late with this headline
55,Amputees may have issues
56,"It‚Äôs not meant to stop rape, it‚Äôs supposed to make a statement. Obviously rapists won‚Äôt be buying these"
57,As if rapists use condoms.
58,Because women can always accuse men of rape
59,Id say its to prevent false claims.
60,Me about to use scissors
61,Rapists don‚Äôt usually use a condom
62,"Or, what most rapists do, not even use a condom in the first place???"
63,"I‚Äôll never understand this sub, you can barely read the title, and the ‚ÄúConsent Condom‚Äù was a thing in 2019, who the fuck is upvoting this?"
64,the company forgot that knives exist
65,What if it‚Äôs a gang rape? All 4 of them can open it. What a dumb product.
66,"its not a genuine attempt at reducing rape, as outlined in the tweet itself, its a ""powerful statement""

the meme was also unfunny"
67,"Lol, just watched this episode like 2 hours ago."
68,Champed.
69,"""Wait, you guys are using condoms?"""
70,Bro just rawdog it if your desperate
71,Noo! What if I get raped by Machamp?
72,"Mighty considerate of a rapist to use protection, God forbid he leave her with a burden that'll last her years."
73,Check Fingerprint!!!
74,or what if there are two rapists
75,Imagine buying a condom going through with the whole stick just to find out the condom is too big or got too hot and fused together. Wouldn‚Äôt that be a bitch.
76,Inb4 rapists start carrying around hacksaws so they can open up their condoms when they see someone they wanna rape.
77,"How does it require 4 hands to open. Is it made of metal or something, does it have an active bomb strapped to it so it explodes if forced open? What kind of backrooms technology they using for it? From what it looks like, I see cardboard or paper material that could just be cut open"
78,A knife should do the trick
79,"Wait besides all the other issues, what rapist uses a fucking condom anyway?"
80,Powerful
81,I get it's meant to be a symbolic thing but it seriously sound so dumb
82,"According to the comments, the box is supposed to send a message, but tbh, it‚Äôs a dumbass message IMO. 

I mean, it‚Äôs great that it basically VISIBLE proof that both parties consented to not only using a condom, but to sex, overall, but that can also be said with a regular condom‚Ä¶ Regular condoms won‚Äôt show visible proof, but I am, does that really matter when people can just say they don‚Äôt wanna fuck anymore during sex? Like, it really doesn‚Äôt.

The box is really only showing that both people consented BEFORE sex, which once again, is nothing when you consider that that consent can be taken away anytime during sex"
83,What about rawdogging? Would be even worse considering the abortion laws
84,"Once it is open, consent can not be withdrawn."
85,Machamp
86,Why am I picturing Goro from Mortal Combat skating on thousands of rape charges?!
87,"Can't you rip the package open?

Unless it's made of titanium alloy"
88,"""Help me open this or I'll do it without it"" 

I feel like this is more dangerous than helpful."
89,Or it would be a threesome rape
90,yep people who do those dirty crimes care about condoms and safety for sure dude
91,General grievous laughing in the background
92,*Scissors would like a word
93,just use toes lmao
94,This shit is just a marketing thing having no real world application. Life hack channels have probably developed it
95,Rapist with scissors
96,"This isn't about rape you dorks, it's about consent. It's generally about when a guy is pushing sex on someone that doesn't want to, but that someone is not able to reject his advances."
97,"Or..... doesnt go with any.... i cant imagine someone doing this and stopping to conider ""Huh.... i should use protection so i dont ruin her life"""
98,What if they just dont use one? Well done
99,"Could still be coerced, so fail product."
100,"The immigrant rape gangs in Sweden, Norway and Germany: Oh no anyway"
