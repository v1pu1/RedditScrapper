1,Pretty sure they just thought they were possessed by a demon.
2,Thats kinda double edged emotion
3,"I’m getting sick of these memes, this is not how schizophrenia works, not even close lol"
4," I see this guy pop along in memes pretty often recently, I don't know where he's from thought. Can anyone tell me?"
5,Schizophrenic don't see imaginary people like this is trying to say. They hear disembodied voices and some have dark thoughts. But really depends on the person and how severe it is. It's usually caused by trauma. (My grandma and friend has it).
6,Should've been me
7,"Me and my friends like to play this game, when i take my meds they all go and hide and knly come back when i forget to take them, its very entertaining!"
8,This actor is great. The range of emotions he conveys just here are incredible.
9,Literally just family man
10,It'll scare the bejesus out of me...
11,Second person to have schizophrenia freaking out because if they don't barricade themselves inside their room the voices will send a monster from the pits of hell to go kill them and everyone they love
12,I've always thought but never asked. That's a CGI face right? The movements look to weird.
13,Now he has a wife to hit
14,Alright
15,U/savevideobot

17,That is the point…
18,"And in the age of the first person getting schizophrenia, having children without being married could have been a crime, a sin, or a socially immoral status and the best case scenario was being shunned by the society."
19,Don't care didn't ask the joke is funny don't be such a nerd Jesus Christ
20,"Don't forget, we all see, hear shit, and talk to people that arent real, we just accept it because we are asleep. We just call it dreaming, but what if that carried over into awake time??? Pretty fucki g terrifying..."
21,"The Boys, Amazon Prime Video series"
22,"[TLDR; You're not wrong.]

Hi, unmedicated Bipolar Schizophrenic here, I see ""shadow people"", hear voices, and have dark thoughts (but that may just be the depression hitting different.)

My most vivid hallucination came when I went 24 hours without sleeping and kept seeing/hearing a shadow crouched in the corner whispering something about glue? The best way I can describe it was seeing it out of the corner of my eye and hearing over-exaggerated whispers (y'know ""psst, spssp"" cartoon-like shit?) with ""glue"" occasionally dropped in.

So, yeah. Just to confirm that you are in fact right about this meme not being accurate. But it did give me a solid chuckle. However, the fact that they didn't get it right is awesome because it means that they don't have to deal with it, which is really great for them. Sorry for the ramble, lol."
23,"schizophrenia is more-so genetic but can be triggered by trauma. sorta like how someone can have the genetics of an alcoholic but if they never drink, they'll never experience it."
24,Antony Starr is definitely an amazing actor
25,Nope thats just Anthony Starr's acting prowess
