1,Who is Amouranth?
2,Eh.. this is kinda fucking weird.
3,Is this like a simp post?
4,"I mean sure, but i think its like a double edged sword. She attracts the coomers from other girls' stream but she also attracts coomers that dont use twitch. And those coomers that didnt use twitch might also check out other girl streamers thinking theyre also thots."
5,Who the fuck is amouranth?
6,Crédit for what ?
7,"Trust me, she doesn't stop all of them."
8,Just gonna say this but if you spend money on girls like this. You are a loser and should better your life.
9,Unsubscribed?
10,Simp
11,"OK I have a genuine question and not a rhetorical or snarky one. I should say that I don't know anything about streaming or twitch and haven't seen these so called e thots. So help me understand something. What's the point of watching a half naked women for the better part of day?  I'm not discounting people's horniess, I jerk off twice or thrice a day but once I'm done I close the tab, throw away the tissues and get back to what I'm doing. Even if you're watching a half naked chick in a bathtub and jerking it. Once you're done what's the point of continued watching? I've seen amouranth on some show and it said her viewer count was staggeringly high even when she was simply sleeping. So enlighten me about this?"
12,What about that one who had sex on twitch? Or was that her?
13,huh.
14,"She's gonna end up dead young, you can tell she's not doing great mentally."
15,"Don’t hate on her. She does this for money. I admire her hustle. 

Not my money tho. I got bills to pay."
16,"A million dollars a month, I think she’s happy enough."
17,I don't know who that is. isn't it a pokemon?
18,Yikes
19,"i think the money she makes with very little effort is already enough, no need for credit on top of that"
20,I wonder what will happen to those horny dudes when she quits whats shes doing and choose to have private life after being millionaire.
21,I don't know who that is and I don't think I want to...
22,"Doing the right thing, just in a wrong way!"
23,"Huh. Never thought of it like that. 

I always kind of disliked what she streams, finding that the ear-licking thing a really lazy way to make money. But, hate the game not the player I guess. There's definitely a market for it.

I suppose what you're saying is that she is a sh\*tmagnet and can deal with the lecherous masses, and so takes that heat away from others that sexual harassment might be directed to.

If true, then good?"
24,"Simp post detected, opinion rejected, on streamer girls ejaculated."
25,The only credit she deserves is none.
26,"First i read it as ""Amon Amarth"" and i got confused. :D"
27,Not sure it works tho.... have you seen some of those mesasges in game streams?
28,"I don’t really want to listen to her fart and lick the same microphone for 5 hours. 
Idk how people can get off to watching it for hours, more power to them if that’s what they like but I’ll pass."
29,"Retarded boyos who donate, just because they want their name on a banana.
Lula"
30,What?
31,"Completely agree. Twitch has become a fucked place when it comes to dealing with these people. Like dude… if you want feet pics go on WikiFeet. If you want to see proper porn go on PH, and if it’s the “thrill” of watching someone half naked in a public setting I pray you never see a beach."
32,"I didn't know who she was and googled her. I saw how much money she makes.  I've been living my whole life wrong apparently.  I'm a curvy type redhead who plays video games. I work TWO jobs; at an insurance company and designing websites and I'll never make as much dough as this lady sitting in a hot tub and gaming.  

*depression*"
33,Hate that you’re right
34,How did you make the meme with just one hand?
35,There's nothing Amouranth can do to stop me from simping for Jerma
36,She isn't even that hot
37,"This is such a weird take. There's so many streamers that do Amouranth-like content with or without her. And there were streamers before she became big that were doing their thing anyways. I have respect for her for continuing her hustle and she does support girls who follow her path or streamer girls in general who don't. But to say that she's the ""big net catch protector"" for all the horny dudes makes no sense considering that there's always girl streamers that either enable, amplify or lurk on any their streams."
38,She’s Freaking Hott!!!
39,"As a woman I appreciate Amouranth

She doing the lawd’s work"
40,Idk who that even is wtf
41,She literally poses in front of teenagers who are learning how to masturbate. How is she a hero in the slightest bit? Smh simp culture is being accepted into society I guess.
42,Ah a real tiddi hero
43,Dank memes doing pretty good today
44,"Bro I remember her! She wants a farm or something for her animals, I think it was a sanctuary. That girl from Hamilton or whatever is my crush, she would play COD, last time I checked she was playing Valorant. I forget her name, A something."
45,I'm pretty sure she's just in it for the money and publicity....
46,"Create problem, sell solution"
47,Its amazing how she can get 10.000 people to watch a «hottub» while she «changes into a tiny bikini» for 2 hours.
48,Worst take on twitch prostitutes I've read so far
49,Spiderman's a dick he coulda just swooped up the kid
50,She a thot
51,"As with leafy, they smart for using whatever method to earn money."
52,Nah she deserve the streets
53,"Never thought of that, but true."
54,"Once me tell the guys on twitch that porn exists, its all over baby"
55,who?
56,"Except, I'm almost sure many streaming girls would love to be in her shoes"
57,Horny weirdos wormy be looking for softcore porn on Twitch if it wasn't there.
58,"That's not entirely accurate, all you'd have to do is look in a female gaming streamers chat to see amouranth doesn't get em all, sadly"
59,you raise a fair point.
60,"I never thought about it that way OP! She is essientailly the tank, taking all the aggro and damage to keep the actual stream girls safe!"
61,Just grab the kid Spiderman what the fuck.
62,Watched her Vice documentary and interviews. She's actually a lovely person. I started liking her.
63,You know she makes like 1.5 mil a month. Honestly I feel like she’s getting enough with just that.
64,Hmmmmms in Hmmmmm
65,who?
66,"Damn boy, bless Reddit."
67,Yeah its kinda the opposite. Amouranth and others of her ilk lowered the bar on twitch and they consider themselves trailblazers. Really they are just the worst kind of sex worker lol!
68,why the fuck doesn't spider-man just move the fucking child?
69,Who is she
70,Looks like the porn industry nowadays is homemade and shifting to Twitch.
71,"Stfu you simp, if parents taught you rejects respect then it wouldn't be that way"
72,nah she's a vapid thot
73,The people who give money to this kind of people should be helped
74,God I love Shayne Smith comedy
75,"Well she is also the reason so many more coomers come to twich to do Yoga, take a little bath and shit like that. I still remember twich banning you for showing just a little skin."
76,Wow so noble?
77,The first thing I see after searching up her name is a redhead with burp ASMR and fart breaks video so yeah…OP is into some weird shit
78,She has a net worth of $4 million stop the simping
79,I feel like it does the opposite I still see weirdos and coomers in every female chat.
80,Reminds me of superman stopping the train for a child.
81,not all heroes wear clothes.
82,I’d suck fake cocks worn by dudes for money too.
83,Who tf is that?
84,Surprised more people don't suspect amouranth to be trans
85,He\*
86,Wait till this dude finds out you can watch more than just 1 creator…
87,Any gender videogames streaming is low effort mogbang
88,"Itt: guys calling op weird, because they simp on twitch and are embarrassed. 



If you don't think amon catches a huge wave of insects in her spiderweb the first second twitch is pulled up, you're crazy."
89,You think she is only? If she don´t exist nothing will otherwise.
90,"If ur gonna give credit for her maintaining horny guys then u should take away credit for attracting horny guys to twitch in the first place. It’s not a porn site but yet she rides the line to attract a certain crowd. She’s not the reason other girls don’t have to deal with horny people, she’s mainly the reason girls have to deal with it at all"
91,Why tf doesn’t he take the kid away instead of putting every clueless passengers into 40g of deceleration
92,Am i the only rare breed that never knew her .i just know the name
93,Simps must be exterminated
94,"Ah yes. The girl that is a big tiddi bikinis swimmy streamer, that sells porn on only fans and earns $1.5 million every month is protecting girls that stream video games and that don't exploit lonely men for money, by attracting all of the weirdos with he hankalagubas.  
But I will always blame the lonely bastards because they willingly go on twitch to jerk off instead of going a tube site or torrenting porn."
95,Too bad cos girl game streamers also want horny guys
96,"Who's Amouranth?

Is that one of those ""streemers"" I keep hearing about?"
97,"If it were true, female streamers still get a lot of losers creeping from their hole."
98,This must be the stupidest thing I've seen all week.
99,Stopped one bus but there are literally 100 more
100,Deserves credit for building an empire off her tits and simple dudes? Congrats I guess.
