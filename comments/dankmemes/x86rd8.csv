4,"The owner is a hard ass who collects checks and threatens eviction on everyone except the elderly ones living there and his grandson who I see at the office sometimes recovering from some drug bender or in his own unit next to the pool flicking cigarette buds into it.

The owner also kicked out a woman and her wife for having an OnlyFans saying it might as well be a prostitute service, which seemed like to everyone agreed was BS. His secretary I feel really sorry for. She's seems like she's always on the brink of tears, and admitted she's always afraid of the boss. Honestly the dude seems like a week away from a lawsuit."
5,"My advice: always keep your receipts for large payments, use prepaid cards for online purchases or in general to help with budgeting, and sign up for Medicaid as soon as you turn 26."
6,"My life has been so much better after I left school. Adult life is immeasurably more satisfying and freeing than it was when I was a kid. The only thing I miss is the free time. 

Don't ever avoid growing up and taking responsibility if you want to not peak at highschool."
