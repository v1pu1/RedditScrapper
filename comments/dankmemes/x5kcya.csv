1,"I think they had to keep the transition to black and white in mind when chosing colors. 

Or at least, for the first two episodes of WandaVision they made Vision a specific shade of blue instead of his regular red/purpleish color because that one didn't look like him in black and white."
2,old films can be projected into 4K resolution if the original film is available. TV shows shot on magnetic tape and low res digital cameras actually look worse than film from 1930.
