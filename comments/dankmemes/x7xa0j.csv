1,"Yes. I'm a cybersecurity analyst and deal with this constantly.

I've watched this happen to multiple Roblox cheaters/farmers this month. If you have to watch a youtube video to get a link to a password protected .rar archive to install the software, it's probably going to fuck your shit up lol.

I only see it from people doing it on their work computers, which happens often (Just use your personal computers ffs) For an employee, it's much worse. It results in the person losing their job if there's a breach/ransomware, costs the employer a fuckton of money.

I thought that I'd be fighting russians out of hospitals, which I do, but to see that people making $100k from a billion dollar company that launches satellites into outer space run roblox cheats on the corporate network.... well that blows my fucking mind lmao"
2,"Does this also happen to phones? Apple and Android. I’m not even a novice at cybersecurity, just a teen learning programming. I’ve heard that phones can also be compromised, but I haven’t seen news about a phone compromising a network.

Edit: Also because Roblox is primarily played by kids on iPads and phones"
3,"Not really as often but it's definitely possible if apps are being installed from bad sources. If you work in defense, you're way more likely to get hit with some custom made government sanctioned insanity but the average person just needs to stick with the regular app store. That free .apk of a $.99 app can cost you your credit card numbers lol"
4,"Well, cheats have that certain allure to them. My friend when they were a little bit younger (totally not me who has no friends) tried to download an apk to cheat on a 400MB game that was about 500-560 MB, it sounds like dum tech now that I type it out but “my friend” thought it was a good idea at the time, luckily it was an 12-14 year old HP laptop but “I” had to find a new computer from then (laptop was wrecked)"
