6,"With a small modification, you could turn that into a toilet. Cut a small hole in the lowpoint of the chair and don't put on pants or underwear. While gaming, make sure you have an ample supply of spicy processed foods (hot-pockets, etc) so that your shit is as runny as possible. Drink lots of water so that your piss cleans your ass on the way by. Piss is sterile, after all. There are perfumes that you can put in the bag to cover up the smell of your spicy diarrhea. Then you can game for an extended period of time.

I really think that you're on to something here."
