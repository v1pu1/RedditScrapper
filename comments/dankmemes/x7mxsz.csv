0,Clever meme indeed
1,"Dodge people are gays like the mods. 

Change my fuckin mind. 

Oh, and I love my ksg."
2,is this some sort of american meme i'm too european for to understand?
3,"Every Keltec is something brand new, and possibly functional. Either way, it'll be interesting."
4,"Dodge people, yes, are gay... but FCA et al. Has been known for some positively fucked ideas. 700+hp RWD street cars? Sure, lit. Let's do it. 2 doors? 4 doors for more whores? You wanna outrun almost anything else in a straight line? Buy a hellcat. Hopefully you can afford to fix it when it breaks. And while we're at it, fuck it, let's put the same motor in a Durango. And a RAM 1500. because we can.

The Alfa Romeo 4c and 8c are both a fucking riot to drive.
The Jeep Wrangler 392 probably shouldn't exist, but it does. Looks like a Jeep. Sounds like hell on Earth and scoots to boot.
The Maserati MC20 is a beauty and the sound of the Ferrari v8 in the GranTurismo will never not bring a smile to my face. 

I own a Jeep Wrangler and I'm worried about it breaking every fucking day... but you can't say that FCA doesn't do some whacky shit every now and again."
5,"Imagine someone took a land rover and said, ""let's make this bitch go 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds and have 800 horsepower,"" that's dodge for you."
6,"sounds fun and dangerous at the same time, can't imagine its eficcient though"
7,Imagine 12.5 km for every 3 liters inside a city
8,how is that even possible? no wonder americans cry about gas prices while they still are incredibly low compared to the netherlands where I live
9,Itâ€™s not as bad as you think it averages 8mph-25mph
