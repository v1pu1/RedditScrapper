1,Has anyone ever pressed “no”?
2,Hahahaha! Brilliant reversal. I love a simple but clever twist on common memes.
3,What is this Steve Bushemi x Pete Davidson mashup
4,I'm pretty sure 18year olds are also horny teens.
5,Whats with the violin
6,Watch me do a Paganini on my hella impressive violin
7,Plot twist everyone on there is under 18
8,So um… taxes amirite?
9,I did a business
10,Well what if those horny teens are 18 or 19?
11,And that's why all porn sites should verify age by either id or credit card so kids wouldn't be able to just lie and with a single click access hardcore porn.
12,"Porn sites hardly even try with kids -, -"
13,He should be dressed as an old man
14,Reminds me of that episode of IASIP when Dennis looks around the bar and realizes that they’re all minors.
15,I thought they gave up bc they figured out how useless it is.
16,Fuckin young Pete Davidson lookin ass..
17,Mini Pete Davidson
18,If you pressed no to that site it will redirected to President office
19,"You know, I’m something of an adult myself."
20,Nahh I'm going to be 18 this month
21,This is a genius format hahaha gj!
22,"> Wallet, keys, phone... shit where's my violin?  Oh here it is.  Ok, time to head to the Business Store to do some business."
23,"I am going to see what happens

Brought me to another website teaching parents how to protect their children from dangerous websites, kinda wholesome lol"
24,Some will outright close the window you are on or will bring you to another page saying that the content is for 18 and above and that you shouldn’t be here
25,"This was many winters ago. I pressed ""no"" and it took me to Cartoon Network."
26,I like a simple but clever twist on the common meme.
27,"Hi, Stevie Davidson here"
28,I thought Bill Skarsgård
29,"19 year olds, on the other hand…"
30,Because old lame people like the violin
31,Wait yeah i didnt even see that
32,Then I'll go to Reddit to avoid the hassle of I'd checks
33,You can’t be serious about the credit card thing right? That would result in thousands of scam charges on our credit cards
34,"No, teens should be able to watch it, it’s better than them having sex and causing teen pregnancy. Also I shouldn’t be inconvenienced because some kids parents don’t do shit. The world is too childproof as it is"
35,This is what the UK government is trying to do and it will be a disaster.
36,"Nah, gotta support privacy. I’d rather kids have the ability to lie about their age than give up my ability to browse porn anonymously."
37,"I must’ve advanced to the Legendary status bc those sites haven’t asked me that in years. Like many years. 

I thought they gave up bc they figured out how useless it is."
38,That’s fucking hilarious
39,"Correct, old lame people do like the violin, just like nearly everybody else. The violin, just like the majority of other instruments, sounds awesome."
40,At least on Reddit people can’t see your search history not even your internet provider all they see is that your using Reddit but not what your looking at
41,"You wouldn't because if Reddit wants to have porn on it, they should also need Id checks."
42,"So avoid sketchy porn websites the same way you avoid buying stuff online on sketchy vendors. Or if you don't want to do that, do it at your own risk, instead of allowing kids to access porn because it would be inconvinient for you otherwise."
43,"Nah man porn seriously fricks with your brain in a way regular sex doesn’t. Just teach kids to wear condoms, or jack off without porn"
44,"You teach sex ed to avoid teen pregnancy...

With logic like that next you'll be saying we should get kids addicted to alcohol as a way to avoid them getting addicted to drugs."
45,"If people in China can manage to get around the world's most controlling governments firewall, 15 year olds in the UK aren't going to be stopped from looking up titties."
46,Trying to help kids is a disaster because it's inconvinient for you?
47,"""Overexposure of children to harcore porn causing long term damage to them is not as important as my convinience""

That's some great set of morals you got there pal."
48,How about you clean your cookies?
49,Then you'll need I'd for all social media and there would be a lot of bitching about that. I don't want my I'd connected to something online I want to stay as anonymous as possible.
50,Are you dumb?
51,If it does then you’re watching the wrong kind of porn
52,So what are teens gonna do to get their urges out? I mean seriously what’s watching porn gonna do to them?
53,"No because it's technically unfeasible, morally questionable and hurts more than it helps."
54,I do that on my mobile devices twice a week! I’m a legend!
55,"Or just don't allow porn on social media if you don't want Id checks.

Your privacy and convenience is not more important than the sexualization of children."
56,I’m not watching any my guy. Porn gives you unrealistic expectations that make you unable to properly enjoy real sex
57,If you don't know the effect porn has on teen you should read about it
58,"You can't get rid of porn off social media that's just impossible now, not even YouTube can stop some from slipping through, and if it's not porn it's going to be barely clothed people doing suggestive things.

The big problem is everything is online and easy to find so unless the parent or guardian has filters or ways to block this stuff there is no feasible way to stop kids from seeing porn or anything suggestive."
59,"That's why I watch unrealistic furry porn, so that I don't get expectations in the first place"
60,"If you based your expectations on porn you're a fuckin idiot tbh, most people know it's fake"
61,"well thats their problem, not mine. I don't care"
62,"Just fine Youtube or any other social media anytime they allow porn posts to slip through and you'll see how quickly they figure out ways to block it. Just because you can't block all of it, doesn't mean you shouldn't do anything about it. Blocking most of it would already be great, it would be a lot harder for kids to find and access porn.

What you just said is the equivalent of saying, we can't stop all kids from underage drinking so let's just sell alchohol and drugs to everyone."
63,That’s just weird man
64,I think you're overestimating the impact porn has on the average person
65,Eternal Buck when he realizes kids and teens were already horny before porn was a thing:
66,I'm not. You're underestimating it. Go read about it instead of speaking about stuff you know nothing about.
67,"Yea lol, he acts like teens aren't the horniest bastards around. If they wanna see some titties they're gonna find it."
68,Clearly you never bothered reading the effect porn have on teens
69,"The average person, not the people who watch(ed) far too much of it and for the wrong reasons."
70,"If you're talking about having unrealistic expectations on sex after watching porn you're an idiot, well of course porn isn't like a real sex, only dumb people think it is and it's better to vent out the frustration than having kids fuck irl, that's how we get teenage pregnancies, ""just teach them about it in sex ed"" well I'll have you know here at least government is trying to shield children from the information about sex for some reason, sex ed here is a measly 1% of what it should be taught so I rather have my kids watch porn than be pregnant at give age of 13"
71,"I literally never watched porn, and i *still* was the horniest mf in highschool."
