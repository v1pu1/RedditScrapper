1,Fallout 76
2,Star Citizen
3,Pokemon Sword/Shield
4,This doesn't happen to me cus i just check the reviews before playing em. But it does get annoying when your favorite franchise goes down the drain. And you know that if it weren't for the microtransactions and/or the bugs it would be a great game
5,"Gotham Knights. I miss the Arkham games, and the gameplay for GK looks so lackluster in comparison. The world and story look amazing tho, I guess I’ll just have to wait and see for myself"
6,I will go first...  My user name!
7,I still want to see the entire episode Badger made up for a Star Trek episode.
8,"I mean… that’s what gaming is full of. Now at days we just notice it more. Superman 64, ET, I mean even donkey Kong 64 was so buggy the only fix was an expansion pack for the 64"
9,Lol i hope it will actually be more than a tech demo at some point
10,"I downloaded it for free from Fitgirl as a Pc emulated Repack.

If I paid full price for it I would be feeling feels.  I didn't play it for more than 2 hours and now it's just taking up ssd space."
11,It hurts so much when the games have so much potential and trusted devs flat out lie and mislead pre launch. I got bit by cyberpunk and 76
12,"I feel like they have progressively gone backwards since Arkham City. 

Luke Skywalker doing  Jokers Voice was gaming at it's peek and my youth."
13,"If you still want to, cyberpunk is absolutely worth going back to! Almost all major bugs as well as performance issues have been fixed 

The story, world, characters all around make it a masterpiece with gameplay being a bit hit or miss, but for me it was very enjoyable, would wholeheartedly recommend"
14,Cyberpunk is fire 10/10 no flaws great game as long as you never look into the hype and buy it when patch 1.5 released and download mods
15,"Nah BF 2042 was worse

Correction - is*"
16,Badger needs his own spin off show where he gets abducted by aliens when Jessie leaves him in the desert and he ends up getting his own alien spaceship that can bend time and space. He flies around the universe trying all the drugs in the universe with hot babes y'all.
17,"I paid $65 for a game package and had fun playing it for at least 40 hours. I spent another 20 hours glitching through my ship, redoing missions that 30ked, and searching for mission markers that did not exist. If they  just fixed the bugs now and released it as a game I would say it's worth that much money, but they still have to build 70% of the game play and 99% of the universe."
18,"yeah, I downloaded it free too (for legal reasons, that's a joke). I honestly had fun with it, but it was not worth paying money for with what horrible quality it was. It's something I'd expect from a new indie studio trying to break out, not a AAA studio running the highest grossing media franchise *of all time*. Gutted gameplay, gutted pokedex, graphics that look like they're from 2012, all paid online content, and no postgame (or rather, a postgame you have to pay $30 extra for per copy)"
19,I was thinking about getting 76 too... But i decided against it cus it's Bethesda and they fuck up a lot of things. Glad I did :p
20,"Kinda idk, tbh Arkham Origins is my favorite in the series because of how the Year One esq story and character arcs, but yeah Mark Hamil as Joker is awesome"
21,"Yeah that is true but battlefield games come out all the time and not rare and have been slowly going down hill every year or 2 they release a game.

CP 2077 felt like waiting a life time while waiting for it to come out."
22,"It doesnt feel like playing it right nowvmakes any sense to me, every 2nd mission bugs out and they will wipe the accounts a few more times anyways"
23,Normally the bugs in Bethesda games are somewhat charming and mod community can can fix their games but 76 was just a comedy of errors and sweet little lies
24,"That is true, we had to wait so long for it and it was a mess but mess in multiplayer games is much worse for me."
25,"My ex wife sold my home and took half my life savings and she bought....

 2 spaceships in Star Citizen with all of it."
26,Yeah... Was a little hesitant to spend full price on that. There's not gonna be another fallout game for 3-4 years now so much better to enjoy the old ones.
27,"Are there any good MP games coming out you're waiting for? I mostly play SP

I'm worried about Starfield and next elders scroll and fallout 5 in 10 years, 

This next decade is going to hurt the way things are trending.

If they fuck up Witcher 4 then I'm leaving this planet /"
28,"Starfield is next, then Elders Scroll which is still like 4 years away, then it will be the next fallout game... that's like 8+ total... oh man that is like a gap of 15 years between fallout 4 and fallout 5. I  hope my nurse lets me stay up late to play it in my nursing home."
29,"Currently i feel most mp games are dominated by already setup franchise so I'd like to see some good co-op story games.
Lotta good story games are set to release soon but if i had to say I'm most excited about sons of the forest in co-op mp, other than that I'm mostly planning to play single player"
