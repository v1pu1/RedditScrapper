1,"They said that to me in middle school about high school too. Even in 3rd grade, my teacher told me I would fail 4th because of my sloppy handwriting - I'm finished undergrad now and I think my handwriting just got worse since then"
2,RIP to the passengers in the back of the plane.
3,"I laughed so hard that I still can feel some people looking at me in the cafeteria, I couldn't help it"
4,I just love that gif.
5,I don’t know why but that gave me uncanny valley vibes and it’s not even human
6,"Lol and I’m without a college degree slinging bond ladders for a company that feeds me all of my clients. 

I was absent for literally over 150 days in high school and never took the SATs. Just fucking produce value and people will hire and promote you. 

Talk about what flies after high school lmao"
7,Who installed cursed halo?
8,Nice to know that there are other people who knows this gif
9,u/savevideo
10,It flies though
11,"Okay real question though can any aeronautical physicists tell me if this would actually fly assuming we had the capability to engineer a plane like that

I'm not concerned about the feasibility as obviously making something that could move like that out of those materials is kinda impossible, I'm just curious of if we did, could it work?"
12,"It does though.

(My secondary school is a college)"
13,I had a buddy in high school.
14,"Ohhhh, so this is the 'ignoring air resistance' part of college physics!"
15,u/savevideo
16,The passengers in the back dead
17,Yup that’ll be 600$
18,This aeroplane has a better personality than I do
19,Trying not to laugh at this plane
20,Oh shet! This is some fuckin national geographic type of shit!
21,So that's what turbulence is.
22,u/savevideo
23,Lmao my first day of college is today tf am i got experience
24,what the a340 doin
25,No body talks about the edit
26,lol- arrogant teenagers fail the living fuck out of college because their whiny shit doesn’t fly with tenured professors with zero fucks to give all the time
27,I had a buddy in high school. His handwriting was so horrible that he and only he was allowed to bring a laptop to exams to type them out.
28,"Same here. Last year of middle school the math teach said ""THIS is how your high school teachers want it done, I know cause I'm qualified to teach high school"". 

In high school all the math teachers wanted to know who *that one motherfucker at the middle school* was."
29,dead ass they said that to me in 5th that it wont fly and jn 8th now im a senior still acting up
30,"""That's what you get for flying economy, dickheads."""
31,Damn your life must be good rn
32,ME TOO. I was searching for this comment. I knew I wasn’t the only one.

34,"No, the motion and flexibility of a birds wing is extremely hard and expensive to replicate and that’s not accounting what passengers would feel in said contraption. 

If you built a plane that can carry passengers and replicate the motion and flexibility of a bird there are only two ways to theoretically make it work.  

Less gravity and or thicker denser air. 

People have made machines that mimic sting/manta rays and that shit slaps but water is denser than air as well as a buoyancy factor.

I’m not a physicist but a measly mechanical engineering student. Some of what I have said may be wrong. It is just my interpretation of why."
35,Not this design no way
36,"The contextual clues should have let you know that in your case, they clearly implied university (or whatever you call it)"

38,"Idk if you know what shit flying means lmao. It has nothing to do with grades whatsoever its about behavior in school, you have infinitely more freedom in college compared to high school despite teachersin high school saying the opposite."
39,Someone in my chemistry class was the same
40,Almost got this privilege but then my teachers actually started to understand my handwriting and I was fine lmao
41,"It's gotten better in the last year =) , but for real, sometimes I see some stuff here in reddit while having my food in the cafe and can't help giggling or a sudden high pitch laughing when I see something surprisingly funny and people sometimes gives me stares"
42,"Yeah I know ornithopters are extremely hard to create especially for carrying multiple people but I'm just curious if a machine like this would actually fly if it somehow magically was able to move like this, not really considering for passenger travel"
43,"most teachers say “not in college” because a professor won’t accept your essay 9 weeks late

it has nothing to do with partying"
44,Lucky you
45,"Short answer: yes, maybe with more technological advancements mainly in light weight materials."
46,"That's absolutely wrong and here's why. Shit not flying and grades are completely separate if something won't fly it means you get punished for doing it, if you view bad grades as a punishment then I hope to God you never are allowed to teach, bad grades are consequences of your actions not a punishment. It's literally 100% about behavior and zero about academic success"
47,"I’m not going to sit here and argue with you because I’ll just sound like the person you are complaining about 

but you will actually see- good luck"
48,"I've already seen, you just refuse to differentiate between shit not flying and the consequences of your own actions, shit flies and still has consequences good or bad, if it doesn't fly then it's an external force deciding to punish you because of your actions if it's the consequences of your own actions then it's a direct result of what you did, for example smoking weed, in states where it's legal shit  flies but there are still negative effects to using it, whereas in an illegal state that shit doesn't fly and you are externally punished for doing it despite jail time not being a side effect of weed, it was the fact that that shut doesn't fly. Not doing your paper until super late is a direct consequence of your actions, but you are allowed to do it."
