1,She may like you more than you think.
2,Bro this shit is not relatable.
3,"Damn, girls flirt with you?"
4,"Come along, we must do The Emperor‚Äôs work"
5,"As a woman, If another woman is talking to one of my bros, and I know she's toxic as hell and wouldn't be good for him, I'd drag him away in a heartbeat. All the while I'd explain why he shouldn't fall for that siren in the first place. Even if I'm not interested in him romantically, I'm not going to let her destroy a good dude. Now if he wants to be dumb and chase after her anyways that's his business. I'll still be there to help pick up the pieces she's scattered."
6,Sure buddy üëç
7,I love how all people are thinking that this is made up because he has a reddit account lmao
8,"If u like her (beyond friends) make a serious move and move on if it blows up

If not then u also need a girlfriend and yes that means she will loose possibly a lot of access to you but u need relationship opportunities prob"
9,"This is the second Warhammer based meme I‚Äôve seen in non Warhammer subreddits. 

Very interesting"
10,"This brings honor to The Emperor. Courage and honor, brother!"
11,Is this a gen z thing?
12,No simps allowed
13,"Damn bro 2 females in 1 meme, share us some pussies too man we are all struggling here"
14,Lies!
15,TRUEEEEE
16,"Yes, as a sororita from 40k"
17,"It seems so.

I was also baffled by this"
18,"I think it's mainly this, coupled with a few of those girls seeing me as part of their ""territory"". It were my parents to first point out this behaviour. They are fully convinced that find me attractive, and are making clear to any other girl that they will have to earn their approval to date me.
Which I honestly like, as this way I know there isnt going to be a girl that will abuse me, cuz I know I will fall for any girl that will make the first couple of moves."
19,Redditors when they hear a man has women around him that aren‚Äôt repulsed by him.
20,It's a grasstoucher thing
21,"Oh it could definitely be that they're territorial as well, absolutely. Whether they want you for themselves or they're just looking out for you as a friend, you're theirs haha. Like for me and my male friends, I don't want to date them but I'll hang around them and talk with the girl he's talking to just to get vibe on her intentions. You're not hurting my boy. If I think she's alright for him, I'll back off. If not, I'll pull him off or let him know later ""Hey man, I don't know if you saw these red flags but... I'd advise against it."" And I appreciate it if they do the same for me. Just looking out for each other."
22,It is simply not possible.
