1,I always thought they were hated because of how overplayed their music was on the radio.
2,[Can't be a bad band with this hit](https://youtu.be/sIlNIVXpIns)
3,"Ah yes, I to was recommended [SunnyV2's video](https://youtu.be/GFC4OFWIPtw) just the other day."
4,"No its because back in the day you couldn't turn on a radio without hearing them. They are decent, but holy hell do I just not want to listen to their music."
5,imagine dragons is the new nickelback
6,Its also because Chad Kroeger is a cunt.
7,I would say they are mostly generic but maybe one good song. The whole “Nickelback makes my ears bleed” meme never made sense.
8,Someone watched sunny v2 lol
9,Always felt like [Burn it to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HElo91a4s) slapped
10,"After the first album, all their songs started to sound the same. Similar to Hoobastank. You listen to one song, you've heard them all"
11,The memes are good though. Look at this graph!
12,I think Nickelback is boring as hell and they hated against Stone Sour.
13,I like them and I'm not afraid to say it. . . On the internet . . . Anonymously
14,I don’t understand this revisionist history that nickelback is good. They’ve got maybe 2 good songs and the rest is generic at best and awful butt rock at worst.
15,"Also cause it's the most generic rock band on the planet, they're a plain brown shirt. They are not bad, just that literally anything else is more interesting"
16,[deleted]
17,"Amount of hate undeserved? - Sure.

An objectively good rock band? - Thats a stretch.

They have a handful of good songs from a library of 
9 albums."
18,"I can’t speak for everyone, but when the whole Nickelback/Creed genre was breaking out, I was already making fun of them with my friends in high school. It wasn’t because some comedian..it’s the fact they are a generic sounding rock band, and the only thing that separates them from the hundreds of other shit bands the radio plays, was that dumb ass thing they do with their voices. It’s so fucking bad all the way around."
19,"No if your Canadian you hate them, they were jammed down your throat on every station to satisfy content rulings"
20,That random comedian was Brian Posehn and he just hates pussies who pretend to be tough rocker guys
21,You watched SunnyV2 didn’t you
22,Revisionist history by people who didn't grow up in the era. Stop listening to this kid on youtube pretend to be a historian.
23,"I thought people disliked them because they admitted in an interview that they just listen to the top hits and copy them to make their music.

I hope I'm not making up a video interview in my head lol."
24,"Kinda like what happened to Winger back in my day. It was actually because of Beavis and Butthead, but Winger is actually a decent band filled with incredible musicians. Shit just happens that way and it's unfair. 

One of my best friends was reluctantly dragged to a Nickelback show by his then girlfriend. We're both rock fans but not really fans of the radio friendly Nickelback at all. He told me he was pleasantly surprised by their performance. And what you hear on the radio is not necessarily what you get or the image they present live. I took his word for it though. Still not a big fan."
25,Okay I was kind of wondering why people hated them because honestly their shit's pretty good I'm not saying I want to be stuck on a desert island with them as my last CD but they some bangers in there. Fuck ppl bro
26,Let's not pretend they're actually good though
27,Never heard the comedian. Heard them on radio and hated it.
28,"This is a cope, people hate Nickelback because they genuinely think they suck.

That's okay. It's okay to like things other people don't. You don't need to pretend they don't actually dislike something just because you like it."
29,"Family guy told me to hate cold play, so I do."
30,"In Nickelback's defense, they aren't Hoobastank."
31,"This is the actual reason. Use headphones if you can!

32,The reason I think Nickelbad isn't a good band is because my ears told me so.
33,Never understood why people hate them…
34,Looook at this photograph… no just fucking no
35,"They were mocked because they sounded a lot like Nirvana,but with the intelligence and passion completely removed."
36,I love em
37,I used to Jam out to Animals when I was teenager and by myself. I fell for the meme I guess and  was embarrassed to listen to them
38,"They’re harmless, middle of the road rock music that your uncle thinks is awesome.  They’re the Foreigner of the 21st Century."
39,I hated them because they were the Imagine Dragons of their time. Bland and fucking everywhere.
40,"Not gonna lie, I kinda like [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQzn4a5qHT4) because I thought it just fit well for Spider-Man."
41,I really like them. I also like Five Finger Death Punch. And a lot of other music. Never understood the hate for either but don’t really care. I listen to what I want and hope everyone else does the same.
42,"I always hated the mom rock genre in general. Daughtry, Creed, Finger 11... Nickleback was just one of them. I think people remember them more because of the meme, but for a while in the early 00s that type of music was everywhere and it all sucked"
43,"So my guess is that a YouTuber did a video on why nickeback hate is an unjustified hivemind, so now zoomers will create a contrarian hivemind where Nickelback is good?"
44,"Oh and also their music actually does suck, to anyone with any decent taste in music whatsoever.  Rock by numbers, played on the radio 24/7 by the band's corporate owners, just commercialized as fuck with every single detail about the band planned out down to the stupidest detail.  

I've never gone out of my way to attack Nickelback, but now that this horse shit is trying to take shape where people (who always have to be contrarian because they think it's an automatic awesome character trait) are pretending they're some great rock band, I'll speak the fuck up.  I do not like Nickelback, and it has nothing to do with some comedian or some bandwagon bs.  They might not deserve as MUCH hate as they get, but don't pretend they're good."
45,I won free tickets to a Nickelback show 4 or 5 years ago. I went begrudgingly only because my family member wanted to go. It actually was a pretty fun show. They perform well live and Chad actually is really good at interacting with the crowd. Overall not a bad time.
46,Look at this Graaph!
47,Chad Kroeger sounds like he's unloading an 8-pack of White Castles he ate the night before when he sings
48,"Well, yeah, that and they suck."
49,I hate Nickelback
50,"Nah, their music is the kind of painfully mediocre crap people who only listen to the radio find appealing.

The quickest way for me to find out you have no taste whatsoever is to hear you think Nickelback is good. It's like if someone took Nirvana and removed all the energy, the songwriting, the musicality and the passion. Just a genuinely pointless musical endeavor."
51,"Every time Nickelback releases a new song:

The comments - ""OMG, Nickelback is heavy now?""

Like, dude, don't get me wrong not all of their songs are bangers by any stretch, but I don't really know where the ""they're too soft"" memes are coming from. The band really only had one abysmally soft album since they became massive in the 2000s and that's No Fixed Address. I feel like if you want to make the most neutral assessment of the band possible, you can say ""Nickelback is grunge rock for people who like pop"". Nirvana and Seether are a little too 'adult' or 'real' for you? Nickelback's got you with party anthems and songs about picking girls up at bars in the Midwest.

If you really want to hate on a band that rose to fame in the 2000s who just churned out formulaic shit after they became popular, hate on Hinder. Everything after All American Nightmare is ass, and even that album was nowhere near as good as EB and TITTL. LOL!"
52,Never made it as a wise man
53,"As someone who saw them playing on the pub circuit, back in what is now considered The Day, the band were decent people....Chad however was a bit of an antagonistic piece of shit, and an asshole. 

I'll show myself out, looking forward to seeing how many downvotes this gets."
54,What comedian? Nickelback is just ....shit...that's all
55,"I don't dislike Nickleback, I just think their music is cringe."
56,I like some of their songs. Was introduced to them when the soundtrack Hero for the 1st Raimi Spiderman movie came out
57,They also wrote the same song twice
58,Look at this photograph? Fuck you.
59,"Nickelback goes hard, never heard anyone hate them."
60,I thought they were hated because they USED to be a good rockband
61,Nickelback is gud bc they was in flatout 2 ost
62,"…And they say that a hero can save them, I’m not gonna stand here and wait!"
63,I forgot they existed until just now lol
64,Look at this graph
65,"Look at this meme - Nickelback, probably"
66,I see OP had that video in their suggestions too.
67,Yeah we all saw the same video OP. The fact that you were able to turn it into a meme is neat though.
68,There was just one song I liked
69,This is how you remind me of what I really am
70,I only like Rockstar and How You Remind Me. Their other songs are pretty mid or bad
71,They're bad but in the same way all mainstream rock bands are. They latch onto trends and play in whatever style is going to get them the most attention. Papa Roach does it too.
72,Bro watched that one video that showed up on everyone’s YouTube feed
73,SunnyV2 is awesome
74,If the color beige was a rock band it would be Nickelback.
75,"Damn, you watched the sunny v2 video"
76,"I like nickelback music. Don't care about or for Chad whom I heard was an asshole, but I like their light tunes."
77,Nickelback isn't bad. It's just kinda mediocre...
78,I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
79,stop tampering with the temporal timeline
80,"Nickleback actually has a tour jacket in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.

I’ts in the lost and found."
81,Somebody watched the Sunny V2 vid. It was one of my favorites by him tbh
82,I really like the Spiderman ost and the Savin me mv
83,"Or it's because half their songs use the exact same riff and are practically indistinguishable from each other.

But I do give them credit for ushering in the end of the boy band era and the reemergence of bands actually playing instruments again"
84,Lol someone has watched YouTube recently.
85,"Makes me think of this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgh4wSxAKqo"
86,It’s also because their record label sued them for plagiarizing themselves and they were basically right
87,Look at this graph
88,Sunnyv2 moment
89,Nickelbald https://youtu.be/MOfvaUwWi2k
90,I mean I kinda agree
91,"I see you also saw that video on YouTube.

the algorithm works in mysterious ways."
92,They are actually awful and just over produced sound with zero musical talent above a 5th grade level
93,The Craig David effect.
94,I hate this meme template so fucking much
95,They once played an illegal club owned by a serial killer so there's that.  (Robert Pickton's Piggy Palace)
96,listen all i’m saying is you haven’t lived until you’ve thrown ass to shakin’ hands
97,Who was the comedian
98,"Saw them live in 2018. They sounded awful, and it was genuinely one of the worst performances I've seen live by a major band."
99,Imagine Dragons is the Nickelback of the 2010s/20s
100, Nah. They're pretty bad.
