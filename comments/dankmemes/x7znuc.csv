1,Mentions porn and hentai but censors fuck.
2,It's ART
3,"It takes more time, energy and effort to make Hentai.
It's not porn, it's premium porn."
4,"Fake ass template. Its ""no no no"". 3 no's"
5,"The only downside hentai has, is that it takes more time and effort to produce one 

But boy, is it worth it"
6,Search engines and tags are definitely better on hentai websites.
7,[deleted]
8,That's sad
9,Least delusional hentai fan
10,I am better
11,True
12,True chads watch both
13,Only for the weebs
14,"Actually, its the opposite."
15,That's enough Reddit for one day
16,Porn > hentai. Reject real women convert to animated women
17,Tbh I barely watch porn anymore hentai is where it's at.
18,"true, very true"
19,[removed]
20,Dudes who watch hentai are the same guys that stare at 16 year old high school girls
21,Hentai is like the vegan version of regular porn
22,"One advertises drawings of underaged characters and immoral behavior. One actually “employs” underaged individuals and sex slaves while trying to hide it (as well as other unethical/illegal behavior) 🤔 

Hentai really is the upgrade imo. At least animals and people aren’t physically and psychologically abused."
23,society
24,where does yiff fall?
25,u/repostsleuthbot
26,Family friendly stuff.
27,Agree
28,It's just like how the hentai censors the actual naughty bits you wanna see.
29,At least that's what I keep telling myself...
30,Stanley hudson approved this message
31,"And the people who make hentai are actually talented, like some of the hentai i have seen is very beautiful looking"
32,"urgh to be fair, given the production values I have seen in recent OVAs, I mean like last 5-6 years...I'd say at this point it takes more effort to create standard porn...honestly, it went fuckin' downhill a lot...back 10 years ago I was looking to like half or more monthly releases, nowdays Im happy if Im looking forward to 1 every 4 months"
33,[deleted]
34,"It also doesn't hurt anyone


*porn ptsd and things*"
35,I read the 3 no's with the bitconnect guy's voice
36,when you haven’t felt the touch of a woman
37,"porn addicts*

sources: am one of them😔"
38,Wait a minute...
39,Avarage redditor
40,"

Emotional damage"
41,you realise that everything that you see on your phone can be considered a drawing right? real porn included
42,"So what? It’s not like me doing it to hentai will make your grandma die or some shit, just shut the fuck up captain obvious, cope."
43,Bro normal people agree with you
44,Bold of you to assume they leave their house
45,The ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent.
46,totally wrong my dude
47,At least the porn companies hide their shitty behavior. Meanwhile children stuff is drawn everyday without consequences. Is it really the upgrade to be able to watch children have sex albeit drawn ones?
48,"
>At least animals and people aren’t abused.

We're not expecting Special Forces."
49,"Fair fair, that's why hentai studios censor their dicks"
50,"Sometimes, porn is too family friendly"
51,[removed]
52,now i’m telling you that too. it must be true
53, Good visuals with terrifying sexualized stories
54,"Like what?

Asking for a friend."

60,What no father figure does to mfs
61,What a weird cope
62,Least schizophrenic Redditor
63,"Even the ones downvoting know I'm right, they don't even try to despute it"
64,Ok edp
65,Hiding actual child abuse is worse than drawing pictures and calling them children yeah
66,Me watching hentai with my family after they censored the genitals:
67,How much of a dick do you have to be to get censored in an animation
68,Especially incest
69,Bot account spotted
70,And porn has the better stories… yeah right

72,Acting and drawing aren’t the same thing
73,"SFM? Right, because [Red Spy humping a goat](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) is right up there with some of the fucked up shit people have drawn and animated by hand."
74,"Well, I could be wrong, but I believe ""woman "" is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era."
75,You're the one who is butthurt about cartoons man
76,Dumbass made up random bullshit just because he can’t cope
77,"Look at superman over here, flew out of the clouds to save us all from masturbating to hentai, what a hero"
78,"They are still children as they look like children despite being pictures. Also, do you see porn companies depicting children getting abused freely? I’m not defending porn companies here, they are shady assholes, but to say hentai has no evils is ignoring most of the issues they have"
79,me spotting the same joke for the 5000th time
80,Enough to fuck around with a pussy
81,It fucking does you dimwit. Unlike hentai most porn is not about women getting raped or little boys/girls having sex.
82,"Oh.

Wholesome.

# /s"
83,comparable to gay tentacle porn
84,I'm pretty sure a women is that weird plastic tip on the end of a shoe lace.
85,"You're the one who's butthurt about me calling people who jerk of to cartoons losers man

Must have felt personally attacked"
86,"I don't jerk of to cartoons, I don't have to cope lmao"
87,"I gotchu, it's all love ♥"
88,"Weird all this time i thought there was a separation between reality and fiction, i don't think it's bad if it does not hurt someone real.
Bad= harm, any kind
Neutral= the lack of harm of any kind
Good= the contrary to harm"
89,"Welcome to the internet.

Have a look around."
90,Does that mean you watch child hentai ?
91,You must not watch alot of porn then lmao
92,"Well, the way it bends, you got a point."
93,"If I disagree with nazis, it doesn't mean I'm a victim of holocaust - you're just speaking nonsense"
94,My man jerking off to his own reflection :0
95,"Regardless of if it’s fiction or not it still constitutes as child porn due to depicting underage people regardless of if it’s fictional or not. It’s like a lawyer defending a client that he has witnessed kill. You can’t hurt anybody that isn’t dead, but it’s immoral to defend someone you know without doubt did wrong"
96,Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found
97,"How clever... And no, but I know because you can't open a hentai site without seeing a ton of loli stuff plastered in the main page."
98,"Yes, I dont watch child porn. Do you?"
99,I'm not that based
100,"You meant to say ""someone watching someone kill another one in a movie"". Because that's the proper comparison."
