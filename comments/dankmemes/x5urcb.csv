45,The guys in the video. They do a lot of similar stuff like this.
46,Hahahahaha
47,Why did you get downvoted ?
48,All you did was add text to an already funny video
49,people have weird tastes
50,"Ahhhh booooo, taking away my upvote."
51,ok thanks
52,"Because he reposted someone elses content and was like ""who DAT¿"""
53,"that is called meme, use a template and slap text to it"
54,You don’t have to do that.  It’s new to you and it’s still funny.  This is my second time seeing it and I’m still cracking up.  My favorite part is the guy tip toeing up the stairs.
55,"so you never upvote any meme because who made it usually did not make the template, right?"
56,Fair enough
57,i did not reposted i just create a meme out of it
58,At least give credit to the people who made your meme possible😂
59,There's a difference between a template being used and writing a headline to a whole video.
60,You didn't create a meme that's what the point of their original video was. Quite literally a repost.
61,"no idea who the creator is, i just took a meme, deleted the text and added my own"
62,you don't know how memes work
63,"This “meme” is funny because of that persons content, not just because you put text over it. They deserve some credit 🤠"
