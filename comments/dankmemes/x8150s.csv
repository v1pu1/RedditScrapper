1,"To be fair, PG&E is the main energy company in California and they obviously don't give two shits about the people."
2,A significant portion of California's population is part of the reason there are warning signs on detergents
3,"Illinois is working on the same game plan, closing existing power plants. While assuming there will be enough solar and wind power to replace them with. Best yet they are taking the best farmland out of production to build the solar farms."
4,Someone tweeted out a Tesla being charged by a gas generator out in Cali because the grid was having rolling blackouts LMFAOOOO
5,"Fun thing, we swedes shut down 4/10 of our full functioning NPP’s the other year and guess what? Our energy grid also “got shot”. Isn’t that just the weirdest of coincidences?!"
6,California is awful don’t move here! 😎
7,"I live near Diablo, the last nuclear plant in California. Most people hate that they will be closing it here soon."
8,Companies get paid more to replace electrical infrastructure when it breaks than repairing or upgrading old infrastructure.
9,"California: our power grid can’t handle it when we turn on the AC

Also California: let’s force everyone to get electric cars in 10 years 

Also also California: let’s impose taxes and fees on those who want to switch to solar"
10,"Oh you've got to be fucking shitting me.

What is this, the eighties? Why are we afraid of nuclear power AGAIN???"
11,This meme won’t do well because californians are too deep in their own shit to admit it
12,"Are we just going to ignore that San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was , essentially, sabotaged by the operator? ""California"" didn't take it offline, the private operator cheaped out on a replacement part and it failed."
13,"As a Californian, I agree. They're literally telling us not to charge electric cars yet heavily promoting that we switch to all electric cars and housing systems instead of natural gas. I hope people in government and the population realize how effective nuclear is again."
14,Yeah big corporations and government buildings can be on all night with AC blasting but all citizens please stop using your power in your house for the afternoon please. Oh also we’re getting rid of nuclear power go fuck yourself.
15,"Fun fact, this meme is just super inaccurate!

The issue CA is running into now is peak power generation not consistent power generation. It is a problem that every single grid struggles with and tends to coincide with high heat because of the power draw of air conditioning.

The power plants that account for peak power generation aren't even the same ones that you are talking about. Peak generation requires smaller plants that are typically offline to be brought online. It isn't even possible to turn a nuclear plant on and off the way that is required for peak electricity days."
16,If Californians could read this would really upset them
17,"When I say Texas and California are opposites sides of the same coin, I don't mean social policies I mean crap like this."
18,same in germany
19,Nuclear power is bad because… well… IT JUST IS OK???
20,"Me who doesn't live in California: Oh no, anyway"
21,THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF THE HARD PILL TO SWALLOW MEME!!!!!
22,Hella based
23,"There are many major factors and this is not one of them.  One big factor is their strict zoning laws, that practically enforce a suburban sprawl.  All that grid… such large amount of utilities for such few people, yet the expect the same level of maintenance and upkeep as a densely populated city."
24,The greenest way to produce energy is to chain people to a giant wheel and have them walk in circles day and night to generate electricity but be careful one of them might be Conan the Destroyer who will kill the enslavers
25,They have all the right intentions and none of the right ideas
26,Spot on
27,Lol truly a true dank meme
28,"Texan here, our power grid sucks too, we know how it feels."
29,I fucking hate this place
30,"Moved to Riverside from Minnesota for grad school, this state honestly feels like another country"
31,"Uh oh anti-California post, Reddit hive mind isn’t going to like this"
32,"Germany and Italy same. Now want to do a deal with Russia over Ukraine.

They lost their national sovereignty because they wouldn't build any nuclear power.

Freaking idiots."
33,"I think Nuclear should definitely be more widespread than it is. Sure, the freak accidents and meltdowns occur but the chances of a Chernobyl-scale or 3-Mile Island incident happening are miniscule at best.

Hell, even the disposal of nuclear waste has improved drastically in these few decades, with other countries figuring out ways to recycle most of it into lesser fuel for commercial reactors and stuff. I've got hopes the US will eventually follow suit as it could be a good way to both open jobs and invigorate the shambling economy, but I'm no economist."
34,"As well as,

""Look at the stewpid Texans in their red state, they are uneducated and can't make proper decisions"""
35,PG&E doesn't give two shits about their customers. They'd rather watch a town burn to the ground than update their failing infrastructure. Not a good thing for a public utility when climate change and fire suppression are making fire seasons longer and more dangerous.
36,"Gonna get down voted for this but idc, my biggest issue with Nuclear energy is that I do not trust company’s to safely manage the waste for the next x thousand years. Especially if we significantly up the total amount of nuke energy in the coming years."
37,California is a shit show.
38,Can we have less posts of stupid reasons to bash on the U.S. and more posts of actual reasons to hate on California on reddit? Because it's a terrible state.
39,"Dude I literally wrote in essay on this today.     In fact… it was actually right when you uploaded this, got anything to say about that funny man?"
40,Our governor is a moron. That's the reason why we have issues
41,"Why is this ""California lost power"" misinformation everywhere today? 

People died in Texas when they lost power due to their idiotic libertarian practices. California is fine."
42,"I hate how the Redwood curtain gets lumped into the ""state"" of California. They come from the bay area into the forest making the local people get fucked by the rise of property value. At some point we need to just refuse to be governed by them."
43,"The only theory now make sense, despite nuclear power beeing our only hope the Ultra rich are hoarding all of the fuel for their life after either the earth or after humanity as we know it"
44,Replace California with Texas and “gasoline cars” with “liberals” and you’ve got something that actually is funny *and* true
45,I'll never smile more than when california becomes uninhabited.
46,I for one hope that southern California and everyone there have a complete collapse of society and that we fence the whole place off and keep them from fucking up the rest of the country.
47,What is this from
48,*Laughs in texas*
49,Does Vegas get outages like this?
50,Why do they have cars when they cant even drive?
51,At least it’s not as bad as Texas grid.
52,*laughs in german*
53,NP is bullshit
54,"Our grid NEVER went off, are you guys talking about texas??"
55,[deleted]
56,Surely it's because of Texas's solo grid that they were shittin on
57,"By increasing the carbon ppm in the atmosphere past 400?   

Because oil companies spent billions on a propaganda campaign to convince millions of Americans that man-made climate change is a hoax?"
58,No
59,"> To be fair, PG&amp;E is ~~the main energy~~ [a] company ~~in California~~ and they obviously don't give two shits about the people."
60,PG&E is a safety company that happens to produce power.
61,"As a Californian I must ask, Is Alabama before or after California on the intelligence list. People from Alabama know they're dumb. People from California invest in Gamestop."
62,"Considering that CA is the most populous state in the US then yes, by the numbers there is going to be more dummies there. Percentage wise though I have to imagine it’s much better off than other states."
63,"As someone living in southern California, we haven't had a single outage this summer. Our air quality is actually good now. People keep talking shit about iur policies but everything has been fine for my area.

Why don't you guys go bash on Texas' power grid?"
64,"Warning signs on anything*

Warning, entering this garage exposes you to harmful chemicals that may cause cancer.

Warning, this spoon holder is made using materials known to be carcinogenic.

And my favorite one:

Warning, this building is made using materials known to cause cancer. Entering this building puts you at risk by exposing you to said chemicals."
65,"Solar farms are a mistake in my opinion, I think that putting them on rooftops of buildings is a good idea but I dont think we should be clearing large portions of land for solar power."
66,"Sounds dumb, and maybe fictional. You can absolutely farm under solar cells, see agrivoltaics for more."
67,The grid never went off though
68,"Doing x gives y. 

Does x. 

Gets y. 

Why tf would z do this to us."
69,"1. It's near a fault line that nobody knew was there when it was sited.
2. It's old technology, better designs exist.
3. It's an old plant that was designed with a finite lifespan, nobody has any right to be upset it will be closed, that was always the plan.
4. There is an emergency bill that just passed to shovel $1.5B to the operator of Diablo and ask them pretty-please to keep running it."
70,Can cali just burn up and break away already?
71,"Blame oil company funded propaganda, the solar lobby, and uninformed environmentalists."
72,The whole countries grid struggles with dealing extreme weather conditions. Texas grid literally went offline and people died.
73,"california is a shit hole

source - californian"
74,"Fortunately they need electricity to access the internet, so we don't have to worry about them."
75,"Not sure where you do business, but my massive office building with 20 floors turns off AC/heat at 6pm on the dot. Why pay for an unused utility?"
76,"Consistent energy production from nuclear builds a base of energy production which then allows other power plants (like coal and oil) to be brought online during peak power events. With no nuclear, the coal and oil power plants are used as the base power and consequently there is nothing left to bring online in peak power events."
77,Bruv you shift consistent production to nuclear... It's so obvious
78,"Just wait until half of their cars are ev.

Iirc an ev draws as much power as a single home ac unit."
79,"The increased solar on the grid makes the peak problem harder. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve

Solar causes a huge increase in demand at 4-9pm which are precisely when we are being asked to conserve.

If we had more nuclear base load we would be able to use natural gas to spike more. You can see this on sept 6th or 10th 2020 on the caiso website. This was one of the hottest days in LA and you can see the massive spike in gas plants kick in at that time go cover solars duck curve.

I dunno what the increased demand on CA’s grid is from if I were to guess it’s higher EV/energy demand, and overall higher temperatures? But we don’t have capacity to ramp up."
80,"This probably won’t gain a lot of traction. Seeing how all these Squirrel Eaters and Cousin Fuckers in here are to busy huddle jerking to actually do research. Imagine living in Muncie, Indiana or Johnstown, Pennsylvania and laughing at people in California. Lmao! Gotta love Shit Kicker mentality!"
81,"Alright, then explain them also shutting down coal power plants. Those are the ones that handle peak generation, and CA shut them down too."
82,Not to mention the crux of the argument is that California is blaming gasoline cars for the power grid issue...
83,I'm from California I read it and I just have questions. I'll keep them to myself.
84,The percentage of ppl who have experienced outages is extremely small but “CA sucks amirite.”
85,Facts
86,"Thier power grids are two different beasts with two different sets of problems..

What you're is just an idiot."
87,The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
88,"lol ya ""california bad"" memes are so dank, such good content"
89,Moved to Bay Area from Texas for grad school and I completely agree.
90,"To be fair, France has many nuclear power plants and are one of the main reason for the electricity crisis in Europe because of them."
91,Hey if we keep relying on fossil fuels instead there won’t be 1k years to worry about
92,Oh yeah they also ship Norcals water down to the fucking desert and tell US to conseve water but they can have pools and shit.
93,Why?
94,better than whatever stupidly unrealistic idea you have
95,"Ah yes, a sheep to the anti-nuclear propaganda from oil companies."
96,Why?
97,Most expensive way to heat water.
98,Are you talking about NY or FL?
99,huntsville alabama is where literal rocket scientists develop new tech.
100,They're dumb*
