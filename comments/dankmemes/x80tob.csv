36,"Honestly, Robin shouldn't have been one step off the fucking curb."
37,The gif still makes like 0 sense to me and I've watched every season of the boys
38,"But Robin didn't ask Hughie on a date and also she was killed by A-Train, not a car."
39,Imagine needing a girlfriend when you got the boys
40,I stopped watching after that scene
41,and then you become low budget anime protagonist
42,Okay
43,"R.I.P Benny Harvey

I'll miss you big guy"
44,Truck-kun never dissapoints
45,Tf are you talking about she was on the road. Its her fault for obstructing justice
46,Lmao true
47,I wonder if that line was a commentary on jaywalking.
48,Yea ive never seen this gif ever
49,girl asks them out on a date. random car a-trains girl. no date.
50,it’s a clip from his music video on youtube
51,I didnt say she did/was? I was just giving context to A-Train because the person didnt get it
52,I got so hooked i binged all three seasons in like three weeks
53,"I think more a commentary on how frequently we place the blame on pedestrians when a car runs them down regardless of the situation. 

You see it all the time on Reddit. Most people see themselves more as driver than pedestrians and jump through hoops to justify reckless habits because they frequently do the same (speeding, running red lights, texting while driving,etc) ."
54,"He isn’t saying u did? Only that the meme doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, it’s basically just a reference to a show people like"
55,"What you said is true.

But it's an explanation of The Boys not an explanation of the meme.

That's all."
56,The words he used sound like he was correcting me
57,I dont really get the meme either tbf
58,Oh yh just read it again. Never mind
59,"Lol I'm still scratching my head, mate."
