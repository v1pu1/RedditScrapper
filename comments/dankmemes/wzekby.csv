1,Did someone actually stream themselves having sex on twitch?? Or is this just a hyperbole?
2,"*‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt show the actual scene from American psycho in a reddit video!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWHY NOT YA STUPID BASTARD?!?!‚Äù*"
3,"on twitch, you can put ""i hate men"" in your stream title  
if you try ""i hate women"", the title gets blocked by automod"
4,"Fucking what??

I hope this is an exaggeration"
5,"Well, yeah


Losers flock to girls doing that and would spend money on it, giving Twitch a lot of revenue so really it's just them being in for the money"
6,"So brave, so stunning XD

Twitch is run by neckbeard losers"
7,#freesdrumox
8,Sauce
9,People still watch twitch?
10,"People are finally taking their blinders off, but simps will still flock to twitch to watch some bimbo play a video game."
11,Typo in meme üò´
12,You got only yourself to blame if you let other people not allow you to say word
13,SAUCE
14,"Average Andrew Tate fan creating based meme from his gold foil Bugatti

kEeP wiNnINg KInG ;)

/s"
15,Proof?
16,tbh no one gets hurt when a girl has sex in front of the screen. also why only specify male streamers saying slurs? happens with female streamers to.
17,"Go become a girl, go make that bank for you jealous self.  In short, go get fucked.

Wdit: i spelled short wrong"

19,A streamer legit had sex and got banned for 7 days
20,"Yep, fully visible fucking on stream, she tried to claim it was an accident but you have to have brain damage to believe that. Then they perma ban another streamer for telling his fans to spam L in pokimanes chat, which is completely harmless"
21,The admin team of Twitch is just a large collection of simps. We learnt that lesson during the Alinity situation
22,7 day ban for having legitimate sex
23,"Nah Im pretty sure twitch is just run by simps, a streamer threatened to shoot up twitch and still got unbanned, what motive would they have to unban someone that insane other than just bending over backwards for women?"
24,"Cazzo un altro italiano

#FREESDRUMOX"
25,Brb
26,"I‚Äôm sorry, but My Bugatti is red :("
27,Google search
28,This is Twitch breaking its own rules and regulations in order to hold double standards and protect a portion of their revenue
29,"Idc that this content exists on twitch, I hate the think of the kids argument as well. But the argument is that they perma ban men for completely harmless reasons while unbanning women who literally stream porn and threaten to commit terrorism at twitch"
30,Thing is twitch having a double standard between males and females streamers. Comparison doesn't work if you put two females
31,jealous? is that how simps defend your goddesses now?
32,No. I‚Äôm comparing the double standard and gross inconsistency of rule enforcement
33,A streamer fucking opened her butthole in front of camera (2 days)
34,"Oh my god, that s terrible, where?"
35,Gad damn
36,Imma need the sauce for proof. And science.
37,Was it like really obvious sex or the sneaky kind that most people would get away with?
38,Who?
39,Is there video proof?
40,Who?
41,"Not for women, for porn. Whatever makes their dick hard is money. If I weren't so ashamed of my very existence I'd take advantage of all that money too."
42,Bro where are you? The food is going to be bland without the sauce
43,Oh I didn't know let me edit my comment
44,I tried but all kinds of regular porn comes up
45,because then redditors wouldn't be able to feel persicuted?
46,"LoL i wouldnt even know dude.  I just scrolled by this post and it seemed a little sad.

You‚Äôre mad at a market and people selling products."
47,[deleted]
48,"eww disgusting, where??"
49,Punishment gets smaller for worse shit then
50,A quick google search has said it was Kimmikka
51,"It was somewhat visible in a reflection of a window

&#x200B;

And he was horrible too"
52,It was streamed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶So yes
53,Op wont give the name and the attention she wants from this if he's smart
54,you couldn‚Äôt type ‚Äútwitch streamer has sex‚Äù ?
55,It says twitch*
56,"The thing is, Twitch is not an actual market for porn, if it was, no one would care. but for example when you see fish being sold in a clothing shop then that's definitely weird."
57,You couldn't be more ignorant of the situation. Educate yourself ffs.
58,*you‚Äôre :(
59,Yeah sex is much more inappropriate for twitch
60,"pokimane isn‚Äôt going to date you bro. It‚Äôs ok, you don‚Äôt have to defend her. saying L+ratio is not worse than having legit sex but you do you"
61,"Bro, go touch grass."
62,"You think you could do better?

Send me the original video, and one of yourself, I'll compare and critique"
63,I googled. Its way worse than Belle D's sad excuse for a porno.
64,Stop he's already dead
65,[deleted]
66,"For that I'd need a girlfriend  


FeelsBadMan"
67,He jumped to the conclusion that I was referring to hate speech
