9,"Start off by dicing your onion, garlic, and pepperoncino. Then move onto the tomatoes. I recommend using canned whole san marzanos tomatoes, but if you feel like being extra you can also blanche some fresh tomatoes if you want. You can also use pre crushed canned tomatoes. You can also crush your tomatoes by hand or use a food processor.

After that, preheat a pan on high for a minute or two and then coat the bottom in your olive oil. Add in the onions and pepperoncino first in order to sweat them for a bit. They will not need long to cook, just wait for the onions to become translucent a bit. After this, add in the garlic and cook until aromatic. Don't brown the garlic or it will become  
 very bitter.

Once aromatic, add in about an ounce or two of tomato paste and fry it for a bit. Frying the tomato paste will add more flavor to the sauce and just make it taste better. Mix it around with the onions, garlic, and pepper.

After the tomato paste has fried for a bit, add in your wine of choice. Ensure it is a dry wine. If you add in a white wine, it will add a certain sweetness and acidity to the sauce. If you add in a red wine, it will add in a richer, almost meaty flavor to the sauce. Mix around until the alcohol smell has burned off and the tomato paste had mixed in  
 with the wine.

Now, drop the heat to a medium-low and add in the tomatoes, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow to simmer and make sure you taste the sauce to get it to where you want. The simmering should take around 20 minutes or so, though really this depends on how thick you want it."
