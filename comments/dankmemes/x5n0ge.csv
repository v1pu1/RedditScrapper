1,He doesn't know they gay
2,"No no. You see, they are searching it to ""research"" it in private to have knowledge of how much they hate it. Obviously"
3,Question: Do people who hate gay usually have like 10G of lesbians or gay porn in their computer ? I have seen people who dislike gay usually jerk-off to lesbian or femboy porn. Anti-gay countries are a bunch of hypocrite if they dislike gay so much why don't they ban all the gay porn. People are all talk but no cum
4,i’m *so* surprised.
5,It’s called opposition research and it’s totally not gay
6,"It’s probably much harder to be gay in that country, so no sex. As a result they need to get their rocks off on porn more often to subsidize the lack of sex."
7,Homophobes are statistically more likely to be gay. A significant amount of transphobes are into trans porn too.
8,"I would probably say yes since it will be ""forbidden"" and therefore more exciting"
9,"Obviously they have to download the gay videos and show them to the convicted gays to show them how utterly *disgusting* (/s at this point) homosexuality is and turn them straight!

Another /s just in case."
10,Two girls double the fun!
11,Imagine: You are gay. Your country is anti gay. It is extremely risky to try and meet up with other gay people. You decide not to take the risk. You are unlikely to have gay sex. Gay porn is more surely accessible. You become more likely to get your rocks off on gay porn since you lack gay partners. Thus higher rates of gay porn consumption.
