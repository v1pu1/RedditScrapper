1,Brushing your teeth before eating is like cumming before putting a condom.
2,Bro your order is wack
3,"Aside from calling it ""washing your teeth,"" I also eat breakfast before brushing my teeth"
4,hold on guys I gotta *wash my teeth* before I look at this post
5,You are the monster
6,"Jesse, what the fuck are you talking about?"
7,I brush my teeth in the shower and then make breakfast.
8,"Okay so like, so I'm done quarreling with some unhygienic idiots here, dislike my post as much as you wish to, but b4 that read the dentist's opinion on this matter:

[second site](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a37370810/brush-your-teeth-before-breakfast/)"
9,British people: you guys have teeth?
10,Weirdo
11,"I'd be scared too, who WASHES their teeth"
12,"Coffee tastes bad after brushing your teeth

But brushing your teeth after coffee is nice"
13,Shit take and you should feel bad
14,I thought this was a universal thing right? We BRUSH BEFORE eating. The after eating rule is meant for dinner. Ain't no way I'm swallowing the bacteria I accumulated in my mouth for the whole night with my breakfast! I know several people who got sick because of that.
15,"It's called hygiene, genius. Imagine waking up and having that stank *ss breath from carrying all that bacteria in your mouth all night to swallow it with your breakfast! DISGUSTING."
16,I pity the person who has the misfortune of sharing a French kiss with you. Down right disgusting
17,Washing them with soap and lukewarm water is the best.
18,Clearly the monster has dentures.
19,The instructions for most toothpastes state that you shouldn't eat something after brushing your teeth for one or two hours. My dentist says the same thing. It can genuinely harm your teeth if you eat certain foods right after brushing. Also do you not brush your teeth before going to sleep? You know bacteria also comes *with* the food?
20,You get sick from your own mouth lmao
21,"Yeah even i thought so, and seeing how most of the comments saying that's the right order are downvoted, i imagine some country where they like to eat and swallow all the plaque and stink into their mouth. It is seriously very, very messed up."
22,"Let me guess, american?"
23,That's why you also brush your teeth before bed. None of that's a problem if you do
24,May I ask how old you are?
25,I pity all the human beings who don't follow this order. Eating anything in the morning without brushing is outright putrid
26,"I’m eatin my breakfast anyway before I do anything for the day, rather have my mouth smell like mint than cereal"
27,"I brush my teeth two times a day, one in the morning and then in the night. But still, your mouth will stink in the morning and bacteria will accumulate in the saliva you had for the rest of the night."
28,"You brush your teeth after dinner and before breakfast, anyone who does it in any order is seriously whack"
29,No wonder y'all need to see the dentist so frequently. I pity them. They have to overwork themselves just cuz y'all don't know how to use toothpaste correctly.
30,"Yeah man, no wonder these people gotta visit the dentist frequently"
31,"No, not American, but it's fucking disgusting to eat all the plaque you accumulated over the night cus your mouth reduced saliva productions. Sometimes if i fall asleep for too long during the day, i brush my teeth then too."
32,*asian
33,We are not fucking like that and I’m disgusted you think we are
34,"Plaque accumulates wether you brush or not, brushing just reduces the rate at which it accumulates and reduces bacterial activity since there is less sugar and other substances of the bacteria"
35,"Genius, I always brush my teeth before bed, but let's say, you're falling asleep with your mouth closed for like what, 7-8 hours? Sh*ts gonna accumulate in there. There is a reason why your mouth stinks in the morning. It's not rocket science!"
36,20. Why?
37,Well in that case i hope you hold off on eating for a good hour after brushing your teeth in the morning or you'll weaken your enamel
38,You must be really fun at parties huh
39,"Even though there's dislikes, I totally agree with you man, straight up disgusting. I bet dentists hate people like this."
40,"Your mouth stinks in the morning? You probably have some seriously nasty tonsil stones or something even worse my guy. Hopefully no one ever has the misfortune of waking up next you before you get that treated, lmao"
41,I wait around 30 ish mins and tht seems to be more than enough according to sources i looked up. But I'd take dental advice from someone who eats before brushing like a pinch of salt so I'm not convinced it damages your enamel.
42,Very fun indeed. Wanna invite me to any?
43,Bro which universe do these people live in? Everyone's mouth is gonna feel a bit funny in the morning especially when you sleep that long! And FYI I don't keep my mouth open for insects to fall in through the night so don't even at me with that. It still doesn't change the fact that bacteria will accumulate in your saliva as you sleep which is why you never swallow once you get up and brush immediately
