1,"So true. I have to remind myself to consciously remember someone's name when I first hear it or it will be gone.

But if you're aware you need to do it's really useful in a situation where few people know each other. People gravitate to other's who know their name in situations like that."
2,"I remember faces, not so much names."
3,"Always the same. You meet someone and 5 seconds later I forgot the name.
If I am lucky enough someone else mentions it later on so I can reforget it again."

8,Bro i forgot the name our my teacher when i was like 14yo... PTA meeting while greeting my brain went *Wait a min who is this woman who has been teaching me things for 8 months*
9,Sounds kinda creepy but you have to repeat their name in your mind while thinking of the image of their face to make a solid connection.
10,Yeah.... dude....
11,"for that he remembers what color the poop was, in which I stepped with my hand in childhood, when I secretly picked currants"
12,"I write down people's names and any important details as I learn them like significant others, kids names, pets, etc so I can recall them. Great for business and clients because people appreciate when you remember stuff about them."
13,And yet my brain can't forget the spoilers I've accidentally read.
14,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live in 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Alburquerque, New Mexico, 87104."
15,Thank god for workplaces with name tags

17,"Only name I remembered pretty quick was my fiancee, she was so worried about forgetting mine since she knew I always forgot, after she relearned it (she forgot the first time), she wrote it on her arm. Fucking adorable"
18,"I came to the comments to see if someone had a helpful tip, maybe soon üòî‚úåÔ∏è"

22,Yup... worst part is they remembered my name and I even saw them later that day. >:(
23,Hi my name is ADHD... something.. something
24,"Too true, there just isn't enough room in here for info like that when I have such important things like every world series winner going back to 1987 to remember."
25,"I ol admit it, I ask the same person everytime their name and admitting im bad with names."
26,I usually call people by the wrong name to let them know I don't care for them!
27,I just read that as Brian
28,Me with the customers name at work this morning
29,I write their name down immediately. I seem like a psycho but I always study later and remember
30,"Franz Haber, the guy who made the nitrogen process, and information that wil never show up in my life again: *a new core memory!*

My best friend for the past 13 years: *what was your name again?*

(They don‚Äôt bother answering anymore. They think I‚Äôm just joking. I‚Äôm not.)"
31,"This is too relatable, I hate this"
32,"Someone need to make a ""what's your name again"" parody."
33,"Honestly every other person I meet I tend to forget their name while talking with them, meanwhile I remember trivial facts that I've read, even if it's from years ago"
34,I just fucking did this today. God damn it.
35,"My brain chooses to remember the first syllable,... 

But destroys the rest of the name.  It instead keeps the information I will never need. Like,... locker combination from junior high, the license plate number of my first car, the McPizza from McDonald's, vacationing in Yosemite in wintertime... Etc.  All thoroughly not helpful while searching for a name,... 

And then there is the added pressure that they are staring right at me while my mind has wondered through all these things as I continue to stammer...."
36,Very much me. However I seem to remember people's faces really well.
37,I thought it said Britain and it was very confusing
38,Relatable.
39,EVERY. DAMN. TIME.
40,I can relate
41,life hack you have to say their name right back to them for you to remember don‚Äôt say oh hey or hi say hello *persons name* nice to meet your or how you know so and so or whatever guaranteed to not forget their name at least not for a little while
42,"Reject names, return to tidbits"
43,"""I need to remember names, not how hot dogs are made!"""
44,Especially if I meet multiple new people in a single day.
45,"I work in a shipping warehouse, when I sign out truck drivers I need to ask their first and last name to enter on the BOL. I have a pretty good memory for names and try to make a point to remember all the drivers I see once a week or more. This has led to drivers preferring that I'm the one in the office to help them, and when there's issues and people are getting mad, I can usually diffuse the situation. It may help that a huge majority are foreigners, and I'm good with foreign names as well. The Polish and Russian drivers are always thrilled when I can spell their last name right from memory. People really do appreciate it!!"
46,"I can always remember if I‚Äôve seen someone‚Äôs face, but never names. When I was told that my grandma‚Äôs friends would be meeting me for breakfast last weekend, I was nervous. I‚Äôve known them since I was born in ‚Äò91, but I hadn‚Äôt seen these ladies in 15+ years. As soon as I saw them, I remembered how much I love them and how special they are... but I didn‚Äôt know which person was which. I couldn‚Äôt ask, so I spent my lunch quietly listening for their names to be used lol"
47,I‚Äôve been waiting on my neighbors to call each other by name for about 9 months now‚Ä¶ they have yet to do it.. but they always call me by name each time they see me. Ah it‚Äôs HORRIFYING
48,Did it twice after opening Reddit again later in the day
49,Came here to say the same thing
50,Repeat their name back to them as if clarifying it.  It helps you remember it bc you actually said it.
51,"‚ÄúHey there, my name is John.‚Äù ‚ÄúJohn? Nice to meet you John, I‚Äôm little-asskickerr‚Äù and then you kiss him. Never will forget Jake after that."
52,"I teach at the university, so I don't have the same students every semester. Anyway, I try to remember their names because it helps them ease the learning activities.

In class, I ask them to write their names on paper, and put the paper somewhere visible. Then, I repeat their names, several times if needed in front of everyone. 

I use to remember words more easily if I see the word written. By repeating the word, I get used to it."
53,"I took her out, it was a Friday night
I asked her her name to get the feeling right
We started talking and she turned away from me
But then I couldn't remember her name

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're memery-free
And I can't name a single TV show
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should get my memory checked 
What's your name again?
What's your name again?"
54,"I had/have this same issue. When I was younger and at a family gathering, I once asked my father what everyone's name was in private. He immediately turned around and told his whole family I didn't know any of them. He always found such great little ways to be malicious.

Anyways, lesson learned. Just don't say anything at all."
55,"we don't care, giving him an upvote shows us enough"
56,"I‚Äôll have to try this next time. Also, nice to neat you, Dasmer *leans in slowly*"
57,"Yup, that‚Äôs the lesson I‚Äôve learned over the last couple months. Your dad sure sounds like he was fun. Gotta love when your grandpa/uncle/dad thinks those jokes are hilarious. Whenever I think I remember a name or past event, I‚Äôm probably wrong. I‚Äôll take your advice and attempt to just sit quietly now. I‚Äôm so crazy talkative though, it‚Äôs gonna take some practice"
