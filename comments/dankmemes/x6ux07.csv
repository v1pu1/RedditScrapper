0,Happened like 3 or 4 times in Australia too over the past few years. Lost count.
1,[removed]
2,But they've come a long way from letting strange women laying in ponds electing their leaders.
3,You vote for the *party*
4,"They vote for the party not the person, pm isn't they same as the president, they don't have total control which is good as at least everyone KNOWS that the party is in control."
5,"The Tories won national elections under Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron"
6,"Am not really a fan of any politicians and not an expert, but wasn‚Äôt the last Prime minister Boris Johnson Voted in via a national public vote. So how can this be the third in a row? Genuinely wondering"
7,"Correct me if im wrong, but the people elect a legislation that then picks the leader. So they wouldn't vote for the leader anyways."
8,People getting befuddled by how parliamentarism works despite living in it their whole life never stops being funny.
9,That's...not how UK elections work
10,Welcome to the party.
11,"I read the title as "" Yeah, this is our mom now"""
12,Why make a meme about something you lack basic understanding of?
13,"You don't even know how your political system work

Damn can use this meme unironically for you"
14,"You don‚Äôt vote for the prime minister, you vote for the party and they elect the PM. These three bozos were elected into their seat so they did win their individual election. Only people in that electorate vote for that individual."
15,"Still a better system then the one in the US.

Bad leader in the UK? Party can toss them next week in a vote no confidence.

Bad leader in the US? As seen with Donald Trump the process is no longer a threat."
16,Truss is NOT my president... literally I don't live in the UK
17,"Italians: ""amateurs """
18,"If you voted for a Tory MP, then you did vote for this. This is how the Parliamentary system works. You've never voted for a single PM in history, because they aren't elected by the people. They are elected by their party."
19,Technically we have never voted for a leader of any party in our entire history.  It‚Äôs a parliamentary democracy. The Prime Minister is chosen by the party with majority. And that person can change. It has some advantages and disadvantages.
20,"\> vote a British PM 

American edumacasyen."
21,u/savevideo
22,"Well yeah, that‚Äôs how the parliamentary system works. You vote for the party and then they vote for the PM. is it that hard to understand ?"
23,"In the UK you don't vote for the leader you vote for the party who then votes on a leader. 

This is not our norm now. It has been like this since the system came into being."
24,Do kings and queens count?
25,Tell me you don't understand the Westminster system without telling me you don't understand the Westminster system.
26,Tbf we vote for parties not leaders
27,"Australia is thinking ""do 3 more and we'll be impressed"". Also check your smoke alarm batteries!"
28,Australians: first time?
29,Didn't Boris Johnson win the biggest parliamentary majority in like 50 years a few years ago?
30,Laughs in Australian
31,Same here in Austria
32,I think that title is a bit misleading.
33,Do you people seriously not understand how parliamentary democracy works?
34,Least it ain‚Äôt America?
35,Jesus people it‚Äôs a joke
36,[deleted]
37,World economic Forum voted for them though
38,Brits witnessing the 56th prime minister in a row that they didn‚Äôt vote for.
39,Haha democracy goes Brrrr.
40,Literally how a party focused parliamentary system works though...they didn't vote for any PM.
41,"In the UK, Canada, Australia, much of Europe and many other places that are much better to live than America we use what's called parliamentary voting. We vote for the party, the leader of which becomes the prime minister.

This avoids the celebrity tabloid bullshit enshrinement that surrounds a lot of US leaders because we don't really give a fuck what the leader as an individual thinks, but rather the intentions of the party is what we care about."
42,  Eat the rich
43,yeah voting for the party ain't it
44,Still better than a whole bunch of total idiots who want to vote for Trump again.
45,"Here in America, they give us an either or choice of two candidates."
46,"At least you guys didn't vote in a reality TV show star who was also a criminal and a shady businessman

Send help"
47,You vote for a party not the leader
48,Americans: First Time ?
49,The monarchy is back in power baby
50,So you can't  have elections if a PM resigns ? Or that only happens in case of hung parliament?
51,Malaysians: First time?
52,"What do you mean, you guys have had the Queen longer than any other human has been alive."
53,How libertarian voters feel everywhere all the time.
54,RANKED BALLOT
55,That was your norm until like the beginning of last century lmfao
56,Italian in Uk ‚Äú it start to feel like home ‚Äú
57,You don't vote for leaders in Parliamentary systems. You vote for parties. And Brits voted for a stupid party.
58,I miss Jon Stewart every fucking day.
59,From what we've seen so far she won't be any better than the last one.
60,"At least us Australians have broken our 9 year curse of zero elections, shit sucks"
61,Classic that its another woman to blame it all on. Fucking BJ should be locked up.

70,Welcome to Australia!!
71,Australia: First time?
72,Wait until they open up a history book and realize 'King' and 'Queen' weren't just meaningless titles...
73,The Queen hello?
74,Ask ur queen üë∏
75,"Yea, but who ask them anyway? They are queen's peasants."
76,It's what they're used to
77,Ain‚Äôt democracy grand?
78,"I thought the Prime Minister is never selected by the voters at all, but instead by the ruling party after each election."
79,"Wait I got a Flair... I love it, thanks.. Anyway.. In South Africa it's been 28 years with the same party winning every time..."
80,Since Britains have never voted for the prime minister the number is probably more in the 50ths.
81,Holding out for the üîí award
82,better that than having brainwashed citizen vote
83,Lol
84,"Malaysians: First time?

Glad to know your former colony can teach you a thing or two."
85,"Time to overthrow the bourgeois, comrades!"
86,"I cant decide if I'd rather decide between two evils, or just have someone selected for me.
Hell, in America it's a combination"
87,I miss old daily show. Cripes i wish i could rewatch all those great years
88,Boris won a general election after initially coming to power
89,First time?
90,"To be fair Johnson did win an election, which shows the British public can't be trusted to make a sensible decision anyway"
91,I love bagel slicers myself. They cut the bagels good.
92,In the UK you don‚Äôt vote for the Prime Minister or a party you vote for a local representative that happens to be part of a party. They all come together in a coalition to form a government and promote a spokesperson from among them them to speak on their behalf of their faction. the queen then chooses one of the many spokes people to be her liaison with parliament based on how many people in parliament have confidence in that person. The Prime Minister is the least constitutionally important person in the entire country as at anytime they have hundreds of people who could replace them.
93,I read that as birds first
94,"3rd?? You mean 2nd.
Boris won a general election with an 80 seat majority.."

96,Let them eat cake?
97,I thought you were taking about birds
98,Sounds like the system they had before with extra steps
99,"Liz Truss is not fit to be PM, but in fairness to Johnson and May, both were elected in internal ballots then went to a national election to validate their premiership. Both won. 

The challenge Isn‚Äôt the system, it works. The challenge is that Labour should have fielded a stronger performance. They‚Äôve been in disarray since Blair stepped down‚Ä¶ first brown, then the wrong Miliband won the party nomination, then corbyn and now stands for nothing Starmer‚Ä¶"
100,whereas here it's just 2 of the last 4 in 2000 and 2016
