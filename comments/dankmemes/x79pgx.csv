0,Look up YouTube ad blocker on the browser store of your choice. For mobile you can usually find archived versions of YouTube vanced
1,Just use adblockers yo
2,I'll gladly stop/start on a video for 16 or more seconds to avoid watching a 15 second commercial.
3,"When you want to watch a trailer, and another trailer pops up."
4,Refresh button named finger:
5,Ad blockers. I still don't understand why people don't use them.
6,Kid named finger
7,Well Its great to have YouTube premium for me at least
8,"Just report every ad. Instantly removes them, even a double ad. It's great."
9,Me when uBlock Origin. (There are no ads)
10,Confused mobile sounds
11,What ads I do get any I have no ad block nothing there's like no ads
12,"For PC, use an adblocker, I personally use brave browser, that has built it adblocker, if you use a browser without built it adblocker, i heard uBlock is pretty good.

For mobile, use Vanced, DM me if you are interested and want a link to downloading it"
13,Vanced Users: ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•º
14,Me watching two 30 second unskippable adds just to realise the video I was watching had finished
15,You just get one?
16,"You'd think those fucking assholes would figure out how to have content aware ads especially considering like 90% of the shit you click on in YouTube is content aware. Like fuck bro, the video is 5 seconds. The ad should not be 2:45 even if it does have a skip button"
17,"Now put it on youtube, so people have to watch the unskippable ads in order to see it."
18,"We do, in fact, live in a society"
19,u/savevideo
20,It do be like that
21,*laughs in youtube premium*
22,"this is fake, only videos over 30 seconds have ads at the start"
23,try revanced
24,"Is it available for android (google chrome)?

Already using on PC, but not on phone."
25,DnSFilter ðŸ’¥
26,It's a matter of principle
27,adblock is piracy youtube is literally going to go bankrupt because of you

31,"Revanceds install process for a person like me, who has little to no experience working with adb and terminals and whatever is so painful to understand. Even an archived version of vanced is better, at least until revanced releases an APK or an alpha version."
32,"Doesn't [this website](https://youtubevanced.com/) have a working version of vanced? That's what I use, should I be using revanced?"
33,They're available for Firefox on Android. I've been using it for 2 years now.
34,Firefox Focus has them built in too
35,And spite.
36,You forgot /s
37,Oh no... Anyway
38,It's but I use YouTube often for my work so it has become a necessity for me instead of luxuries. Depend on the person I guess. In my opinion Spotify is much more expensive than YouTube premium when you comparing what you get.
39,I agree that the installation is difficult for the end user but you dont have to download all files and patch yourself. You can also try [Revanced builder](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder). easy to use and work fine imo
40,"this isn't the official site, only official one is [this one](https://vancedapp.com/), so I wouldn't trust that too much"
41,"This.

And add dns.adguard.com to the private dns setting in android."
42,That doesn't have the apk
43,"True, as Vanced got a takedown request from Google, that's why it legally cannot be available on their website. 

If you want the official Vanced app - and I'm loosely quoting from their Discord server here - you can still get the Vanced Manager app from [Apkmirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/team-vanced/vanced-manager/vanced-manager-2-6-2-crimson-release/) and download Vanced and MicroG through that.

The site you posted only appears to be official but probably has no good intentions. Could be malware to target people who desperately still want to use Vanced, or it could be an unmodified apk on this site. Nobody knows.

(sorry if I seem pretentious here, I just want to make sure people stay safe)"
