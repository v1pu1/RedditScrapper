27,"It was the same sort of brush, it had a button on the handle you held down and would push all the hair to the tip of the bristles and was really good for extracting all the hair my girl was sadly losing. But I highly recommend that style of brush and I'm sure it's not that hard to find on Amazon or probably even a local pet shop, and if your cat sheds a lot of hair then a brush like this is great. My cat loved it ❤️"
