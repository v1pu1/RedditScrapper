4,"There’s a theory in physics that involves you cannot die in your own timeline. Everytime you get in risk of dying, even if there’s a 0.00001% chance of survival, you yourself will end up in a parallel universe where you hit those odds. You are immortal except for situations that would cause a 100% mortality rate."

33,where can I read more about this
34,"That's not a theory, as it is currently unproven and borderline untestable (you can only test once, but you can't tell anyone the result probably).

The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics says that wave function collapse is fake, it's actually just the universe splitting timelines into all the different possible results, but the multiversal wave function never collapses. If you tack on consciousness (not even a scientific concept since it's unmeasurable by most definitions) and a version of the anthropic principle you get what you described.

Keep in mind you had to make 3 big assumptions to get there."
35,What would have a 100% mortality rate?
36,More like a hypothesis since it can’t be tested and proven to be true or false. A theory has to have actual evidence and not “it can’t be proven right or wrong”

I'd say it's just the one assumption. There is no reason other than ancient texts to believe that there is *anything* privileged about the conscious experience above and beyond what we observe.

Continuity isn't proven just because we find it intuitive."
53,"The sun going super nova, vacuum decay, drowning in the ocean, listening to BTS,.... There’s many deaths that you really cannot escape"

58,What doesn’t make sense about it?
59,"Well as i understand it, it’s more of an idea rather than a theory. There’s no actual way to prove that the death of your own consciousness as you perceive it is impossible (in case of a chance at survival)"
60,Not anymore…
61,"good sir,

it is common knowledge that the current queen of england(or the united kingdome?) is immortal.

there have been multiple pictures posted in this very subreddit that prove her immortality.

there are pirctures of her with the dinosaurs, god and the big bang."
62,well :(
63,thx
64,Even then there's a tiny chance that you just Boltzman brain back into existence on a habitable planet on the other side of the universe in the exact state as the moment you died
65,Or a more common one - aging.

67,"Damn so bordem has killed me atleast 5 times, or buildings must not like me."
68,Same
69,But what if
70,"Well it requires the consciousness to be some special state, but all it really is is some current running through the brain. It would require some system to check for consciousnesses that are about to die and then move them into a parallel world. That sounds a bit far off."

72,">queen of england

Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

I am a bot and this action was performed automatically."
73,This comment aged poorly
74,Hah! This ages hilariously
75,Maybe. Just maybe.
76,"Nah, you've misunderstood it. The act of dying doesn't trigger the 'creation' of a new timeline. The universe is always branching out into infinite directions covering every permutation of very possibility on a quantum level, but:

* an infinite number of these 'realities' will be perfectly in sync and indistinguishable from each other on a molecular level, effectively placing you in an infinite number of places at the same time
* not every quantum scale permutation will cascade into a macro event where even a single atom will be a planck unit apart from the same particle in another reality. Despite what's peddled in pop culture, it's very unlikely that there's a universe where you are the emperor of Rome with a harem of clowns (assuming many-worlds checks out)

Think of yourself as the character of a printed book. You are the sum of all the words that describe what you think, do, and experience. The book can be printed an infinite number of times, but there's still only one you. Destroying one copy of you doesn't destroy all copies of you. Minor printing errors, such as smudged lettering, won't affect the way your story plays out, except under incredibly rare circumstances where an ink blotch turns a dot into a comma."
77,"You ever heard of Young’s double slit experiment? Basically, if you send particles through a wall with two slit cut in, the detector behind that will detect two slit where a lot of particles went through the wall (and then hit the detector. Do the same thing with waves (think of sound) you’ll get a completely different and distinct pattern on the detector that appears typical for waves. 

Here’s the interesting part. When young did this experiment with light, he found that if he checked the detector after the experiment, he would find a wave pattern. However, if the experiment was being closely observed by a human, the detector would detect the light as if it were a particle. The only explanation is that the universe knows that it’s being observed and that the observation of the universe will alter its future. This is an indicator that consciousness may not simply be electrical current in the brain"
78,"good sir

thank you for your explanation.

you will notice i already caught my mistake

let me give a counter proposal:

79,">except under incredibly rare circumstances where an ink blotch turns a dot into a comma.

There was a Jonathan Creek episode like this! A small fly landed on a letter and got squashed. The mark it left was easily mistaken for a comma, which completely changed the meaning of the letter and resulted in somebody committing suicide."
80,"The premise was that you survive every encounter with a chance to die below 100%. That doesn't make sense. I didn't state a reality would be created. For you to survive, you'd need to be transported between worlds and that does not happen. Either the current in the brain stops flowing and you die or it doesn't stop and you live.

This isn't affected by multiple timelines. Either you are in the timeline that survived or you aren't. Of course, only the survivors will be able to talk about it, so it's kind of true but you yourself won't just survive every threat that isn't going to kill you definitely."
81,"> The only explanation is that the universe knows that it’s being observed 

I mean other than the fact that 'observation' here means bouncing something off the particle. Other than that yeah, rock solid evidence for us being magical apes."
82,">The only explanation is that the universe knows that it’s being observed and that the observation of the universe will alter its future. This is an indicator that consciousness may not simply be electrical current in the brain

Well not quite, the other explanations are:

* Many worlds
* Particles pivoting along n-dimensional axes"
83,"I know the experiment. Afaik the wave pattern appears without the detector. With the detector you get a pattern that resembles the two slits. It has nothing to do with a consciousness observing the light particles. The direct influence of the observer is responsible for the different behavior. 

Otherwise it would require some universal system that identifies currents that build a consciousness together, so that it can affect all particles the conciousnesses observe.

We know from neurobiology and ai that a consciousness is a very big net of cables that are heavily interwoven. There is nothing inherent special about a comsciousness. It's just some electricity."
84,it isn't exactly that we change things by observing them. in the example of scrodingers cat you observing the inside of the box doesn't make the cat dead or alive but you get brought into the quantum entanglement so you simultaneously find  the cat dead and alive but you only experience one of the two and a parallel version of you experiences the alternate path
85,"Damn,a well outlined counterargument"
86,"You're presupposing the immutability of the soul. Why would you need to be transported between worlds if you're in two worlds at once?


Really try and disentangle yourself from what you think you know about consciousness."
87,"It’s not the detector that makes the difference. The detector is placed behind the wall to catch the light that went through to see how it went through the double slit. You need the detector to know what happened.

The observer could be the human doing the experiment and whether he is directly watching it happen or not affects how light behaves through the double slit."
88,"The soul doesn't exist. It's not a scientific term. 

Ai proves more and more that a gigantic ton of intertwined cables can in fact produce intelligent behavior. The brain quite literally is a neural net. 

You can interpret a similar constellation of neurons like the one in your own brain in a parallel world as being in two worlds at once. But we gain nothing from that. The parallel worlds do not affect you. If your brain stops working, you're dead and a clone lives on in another world / timeline / whatever. It's a clone, not you. You will be dead and do not notice anything from the point of your death.

If you copy your consciousness in your own timeline and live along with a second you, this person is not you. you will still be dead if your brain stops working."
89,No. The detector is placed *in* the slit and very much interacts with the light passing through. A consciousness processing the data is not responsible for the light to behave differently.
90,">The soul doesn't exist. It's not a scientific term. 

That's what I'm saying.

>If you copy your consciousness in your own timeline and live along with a second you, this person is not you. you will still be dead if your brain stops working.

You haven't followed this through to its conclusion. One minute you're on the right tracks, but then your reasoning is stuffed full of the vestiges of spiritual thinking."
91,Yeah like you're the one to decide that. This is not how discussion works.
92,"You're wrong but I'm too many drinks in to care about this, take care"
93,Yeah right. Whatever.
