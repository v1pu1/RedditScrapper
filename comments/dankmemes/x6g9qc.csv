24,He's probably palestenian
25,Because Israel has been occupying Palestinian territories for almost a century
26,The USA sends between $3 and $4 billion dollars a year to them as foreign aid. Money that could be better spent elsewhere.
27,"its a really complicated situation, both pro Isreal and pro Palistine groups have a pint, both both are often quite extreme"
28,I think it's something to do with he occupation of the west bank. Israel and Palestine fighting over the same lands or something I dunno
29,"Lol, really? Ok, the Irgun militia, terrorist group that assassinated British military and bombed civilian druit markets to destabilse the mandate became the IDF. Shit like sinking the USS liberty with zero consequence, google ""operation sussanah""/Lavron affair too.

Occupying territories, bombing caged in high density civilian populations regularly, apartheid AND an illegally acquired nuclear weapons arsenal that they tried to help apartheid south Africa get nukes too.

This is a short list of the shit wrong with Israel, the fact you have to ask shows exactly how protected and bias the world is towards letting this bloodshed state continue it's barbaric violent practices."
30,It's basically South Africa but with western subsidies instead of boycotts.
31,"People believe that Israel is “occupying” palestinian territory, when in reality Jordan and Egypt took over the proto-state of Palestine and then afterwards lost it to Israel when they invaded Israel.
The anti-Israel stuff stems from an antisemitic blood-libel-like myth that the Jews want to crush other peoples."
32,Israel is an apartheid state according to multiple international human rights organizations and even an Israeli one.
33,"They're Jews, that's why. Do they commit crimes against humanity? Sure. But so many ppl on here set a whole different standard for Isreal compared to every other country. They say things like ""you really have to be evil to do things to others after being victim to the holocaust, they just turned the tables"" as if anything was comparable to kill 8 million jews just bc of the fact that they're jews. But yea, most of them won't admit that it's antisemitic and still choose Israel and their people for the cause of all problems and the pure evil."
34,"Israel is occupying Palestine. Israel is an Apartheid state. But these are only symptoms of the real reason that people hate it, and also of how the country was founded and has operated since. It began as an Idea. While many different groups of Jews had lived in Palestine throughout history, most often they were minorities here too, as they were in every other place they could find aside from what we now call ghettos. This was the situation prior to 1948 - Majority Arab and Muslim, with minorities of different groups of Christians, Predominantly Orthodox, Copts, and Local Denominations, and Jews, mostly descended from migrants from Ethiopia, with other groups mixed in. All overwhelmingly spoke Arabic and some Turkish and English. After WWII, many Jews were displaced and needing homes. Some wanted a country to call their own, others were content staying in their country under a new government, some wanted to flee to a neighbouring country, and some wanted to move to places like the UK, France, the US, or Canada. However, as letting hundreds of thousands of migrants in and feeding and housing them was unpopular with the politicians of these nations, likely because of the expanse of building homes and political discontent at home, they preferred a different solution, one which some Jewish and Non-Jewish politicians had come up with - Zionism. Taking inspiration from places like the US or Canada, plans were created to displace peoples and replace them with international Jewish settlers, creating a language and national identity with it. Of course, these plans were not exactly new. In fact, the Nazis had already had a plan of Exterminating Malagasy people and shipping German Jews, settlers, and undesirables to Madagascar. However, now there was a new option on the table - the British Colony of Palestine. As they figured they would have a much better chance of gaining public and international support if they framed it as a ""retaking"" of territory from 2 000 years ago. It worked. With international support, they began to arrest, imprison, and kill Palestinians (Even the Jewish ones). They then began to put Jewish refugees into the homes of those detained and killed, avoiding the cost of just building new ones. Soon after, when a substantial population existed, they began constructing new homes and settlements to move settlers into, pushing out the Palestinian grazers and farmers who had lived there for centuries. The Palestinians tried to resist, but found it very difficult to beat international coalition forces with up-to date technology and air control with simple Militia. Afterwards, a supposed ""two state solution"" was reached, where the majority of land was given to Israel. Of course, this was soon broken and Israel still kills and arrests Palestinians, acquires their homes and land to hand off to foreigners who have never been there before, which continues to this day. It is still murdering journalists, it is still bombing hospitals, it is still committing Genocide. It is, Ironically, the state that most resembles Nazi Germany today - that is exactly what ""Lebensraum"" means."
35,Misinformatipn and antisemitisem
36,Pretty much authoritarian country
37,What's wrong with Israel?
38,"The displaced Palestinians are calling, Hamas says hi"
39,Lol i wouldnt mind that one bit
40,Feels like a funny conversation starter
41,Well it bloody well should be
42,Almost a century? Israel only got Gaza and the west bank in the 60s
43,"The Palestinian territories? Like Judea and Samaria in the west bank, which were occupied by Jordan from 1948-1967 and then lost to Israel in the six day war? Or Gaza, which Israel disengaged form since 2006?"
44,Bullshit you all just hate Jewish
45,Or maybe palestine has been occupying isreali territory?
46,You're telling me israel is usa sugar bitch?
47,like where
48,"Yep, you don’t have the right to be a country unless you win the necessary war and have the strength to keep your borders."
49,"Why not go anywhere else ? why did you have to settle in a place nobody liked you? I mean come to my country come to Texas we have plenty of land you can build homes and open shops nobody will harm you and their will be no need for violence. We can take that 10 billion we send you every year and begin resettling tomorrow. 10 billion dollars can buy the entire state of Wyoming its 3 times the size of Israel and flat and arable with great agricultural potential and moderate climate. if its too far north we could do most of Oklahoma or south Dakota. It would mean no more war and conflict and it would be great. I would love to have you in my country, but i can't support Zionist. It's exactly the same as chin genociding the Uyghurs or America and manifest Destiney"
50,source?
51,"And we are to believe a random guy on Reddit? Most of your facts are historically inaccurate and made up by ME for their own propaganda, as usual western people will believe whatever bat crap crazy stuff people say with a sad voice."
52,Can I be a grammar nazi with this situation???
53,A lot of people don’t like the idea of Ethnostates
54,They are trying to make an ethnically pure Jewish state by Genociding the Palestinians.
55,"Ethnostate sucks? Apartheid sucks too, do you agree?"
56,The simple fact that it exists.
57,"How about the west bank. Israel is the country equivalent of a random guy who comes and moves into your apartment and at first he just takes a room, but every day he put more of his shit on the couch until he has illegally settled 20% of the apartment that was your space before  and he doesn't acknowledge that you have lived in this apartment for decades prior to him showing up. Not only does he not acknowledge that you were here first he doesn't acknowledge that your on the lease at all. He refuses to recognize that your a sovereign tenant. You try to fight back and move some of his shit around and even physically fight back but that just validates his oppression in his mind and he responds with disproportionate force every time.

Worst part is every time you try to move out your neighbors are holding the door closed. You have no where to move to nobody will rent you an apartment and your a very poor person anyways. You see you want to leave but your fucking stuck nobody wants you. IF you could you would immigrate away, but your neighbor's Jordan, Egypt, turkey, Iraq, Syria, and every single other country in your whole neighborhood will not let you leave.

This guy though he makes so much money and he gets checks from his trust fund all the time. He may act like he cares about you a little bit, but its just part of the abusive cycle and he has this batshit insane religion that says that he is a chosen person and god picked him and all his friends over everyone else. In fact it doesn't matter if you believe in his religion either its all about race with this guy. I mean every other religion on earth accepts all types of people except this guy's and believe me he is serious about his racism.

The craziest part is you go and read his book the whole book and you get to the chapters about the 'holy land' and the whole part about the holy land is a story of them perpetuating genocide and wiping entire ethnic groups out because god told them they could have the land. Its not like they were there from the beginning or something either nope genocide is baked into this belief system. This is just land theft round 2.  The followers of this whole religion are actually good people for the most part but when it comes to your apartment specifically they just have to take that shit.

Not saying other religions don't have faults but I have to admit the whole Islam vs Judaism war over land thing makes me sick. You would think god would be okay with everyone not killing each other. You would think an all powerful god wouldn't have mandated an eternal holy war over non-arable, non fertile, non-valuable, devoid of natural resources, not strategically located deserts and rocks. I mean if they were fighting over some great ass farm land and arable lands that would make allot of sense but the whole country is too fucking hot and has literally nothing of value. You got to turn saltwater into regular water there cause they got no fucking water. They don't even got a river flowing through it not one fucking river. I mean in china they got rich farmland and multiple river deltas, great location for trade with north America and southeast Asia. Is that the holy land I mean that's the true land of milk and honey? Nope rocks in the desert, because god loved this spot so much he made it nearly impossible to live in without modern technology.

edit: holy shit I checked the data cause people were telling me I was wrong its not 20% of your apartment he's occupying 60% of the land. That's just the land they didn't seize which is the majority of the land in the country. He moved in took the kitchen, the den, the living room, two bathrooms and left you a closet a room and a bathroom, but 60% of that room he needs for storage and the bathroom is cut off (Gaza strip.) and it doesnt have running water."
58,Typical answer from a typical brain dead Internet zombie
59,"Palestin and palestiniens have been there for centuries, Israel was brought there by the (which was colonising palestin at the time) from Europe during ww2"
60,More like USA is Israel's vassal
61,that + apartheid occupation and shooting children
62,Many counties are American fiefdoms.
63,"If we had stopped sending Israel aid in 2010, we would have enough money to build twice as many schools nationwide (k-12) and hire twice as many teachers, bringing class size down to half of what it is and providing better school to everyone.

Is twelve years of military aid money to Israel worth large class sizes and a poor education system? I don't think so."
64,Like we could be throwing 10% more aid at Ukraine
65,I mean that’s literally how every other country was formed…
66,"Imagine if every Armenian was kicked out of Armenia, and we just said “yea, you can’t go back”.

Also, I agree with one thing. Israel doesn’t need all the money we give them. That’s totally reasonable. But Americans and especially Europeans need to let Israelis handle their own counter-terrorism and stop getting in the way"
67,Do you actually believe a word of this comment? You’re absolutely delusional if you think any of that makes any amount of sense.
68,"Don’t come to Texas tho, we’re full."
69,"yes you can, I was typing that while at school"
70,"No no, see it’s ok because Germany did it to them in the 40s. Now it’s the Jews turn to put people into camps."
71,"Right, except for the part where that's total bullshit."
72,other way around
73,So?
74,"I’m not gonna read it all, but damn dude. 

#STOP, HES ALREADY DEAD"
75,What races does Judaism not accept?
76,[Lol ](https://imgur.io/gallery/wYOdnAV)
77,And what's the roommates excuse for doing all this? Because he rented the apartment once a few decades ago.
78,"Didnt read that but its not the equivelant of a dude randomly moving in and stealing your house. Its the equivelant of you trying to steal your neighbors house, he beats you in a figth 1v6 cause u brougth the whole neighborhood  and instead of just taking back what you took he starts taking your house."
79,Preach
80,you really really don't want to fight me on that subject. the only brain-dead here are all the ppl that comment something positive here. you don't even know what you all talking about.
81,Man do they forget real quick.
82,But America puts Israel before its own intreasts
83,You mean if the government would be able to spend money wisely? Sure.
84,"hiring teachers isnt an issue, its finding teachers to be hired"
85,thats like the same thing in a different place
86,"Exactly, Palestine isn’t special lmao"
87,"Its not even there land they stole it, In the Torah they have entire chapters devoted to their flight from Egypt up to Israel. They came into an area of people who already lived there. God told them the people were evil and it was their land, so they killed the original inhabitants and took the land. Honestly they admit they took the land this is just history repeating itself. A man became favored by god by killing a thousand people and delivering their foreskins to the king. The land is only recently been called Israel in fact just a 120 years ago that area was called Palestine.

A better example would be the aryan's in Germany returning to northern India and taking the land and pushing the people off the land because they were inhabitants 1000's of years ago. They then rename Punjabi to Arya and claim that the Punjab natives were on their land.

They also are taking more land away every single year allowing Jewish settlers to move onto Palestinian land and slowly pushing them into smaller and smaller ghettos.   

example would be if I as an American moved onto a reservation and just claimed the land for myself. Even though per international agreement and my own countries peace treaties this land is to be reserved for the native population I just come in as a settler in modern day America and claim god wants me to have the land because of manifest destiny."
88,One does get the sense of shit rolling downhill.
89,I guess the Palestines faked all those videos then.
90,"as usual islam and Islamic countries full of hatred against every ""non-believers"" then spreading misinformation and playing victim to win the media war..."
91,It is a secular state. If they consider themselves to be a race and then give other jews special treatment then they are also racist.  Not to mention forced military conscription and a extremely nationalist right-wing government. Jeez if they were Americans they would be banned off most social media...
92,"I believe it's a ""closed"" religion. What I mean by it is that only of the mother is Jewish then the child is, by Judaism, Jewish. If you want to convert it takes a lot of time. Years I think. And I believe they won't deny someone wanting to convert. But it's a hard process"
93,"They forcefully sterilized black African Jews immigrating in, but not white ones. Wonder why."
94,"Arabs 

About half of Israeli Jews want to expel Arabs, survey finds

96,"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/18/mapping-israeli-occupation-gaza-palestine

""Israeli settlements are Jewish communities built illegally on Palestinian land. Today there are between 600,000 and 750,000 Israeli settlers living in at least 250 illegal settlements (130 official, 120 unofficial) in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.""

""Under Israeli control – represents 60 percent of the West Bank. Under the Oslo Accords, control of this area was supposed to be handed over to the PA. Instead, Israel retains total control over all matters, including security, planning and construction. The transfer of control to the PA has never happened."" 

You could honor the Oslo accords and return the land?, but then where would all those invaders settle and without your military occupation who would protect the settlers? i mean less innocent children would die, but theirs violence on both sides lets look at the casualties for the last 12 years.  

**Human lives lost according to the united nations:**

between 2008-2020: 

 **Palestine:**

5739 Palestinians have been killed.

 1,255 (22 percent) were children. 

 at least 121,438 Palestinians have been injured. 

&#x200B;

**Israel:**

251 Israeli's have been killed.  

On the Israeli side 121 (48 percent) of those killed were security forces.

 5,682 Israelis were injured in the conflict. 

https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#

&#x200B;

How do you feel about the fact that Israel has killed more then ten times the amount of children then Palestine has killed soldiers? I get it though it's hard not to kill children when your invading a region. You know all those families with 5 year old's just acting so dangerous by trying to work and go to school around your soldiers with tanks and machine guns and missiles. I'm sure they feared for their lives when the two year old reached in his backpack for an apple and you thought it was a suicide bomb. You make the cops in my country seem restrained and I am American. I get why their is no backlash though its not your children being gunned down in the streets like dogs."
97,Israel is a human shield that keeps the Arab world from attacking the US. As long as Israel exists the middle east will be too distracted to cause a 9/11 part 2
98,"One party wants to build more oil pipelines and energy infrastructure, while ignoring/repealing environmental regulations.

The other party wants to demolish roads that are ""racist"", in order to rebuild them somewhere else.

Is either solution the perfect answer? No. Is one clearly better than the other? Yes."
99,"When the pay is shit, it’s not a mystery as to why finding people to hire is difficult"
100,"> hiring teachers isnt an issue, its finding teachers to be hired

The answer is paying more money. Which we could theoretically have, if we don't send so much money into the endless pit that is ""paying for Israel's military for them""."
