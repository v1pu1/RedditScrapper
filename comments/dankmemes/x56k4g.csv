12,"Samsung Smart Fridge, used to have one, itâ€™s super cool. You got the radio, YouTube, grocery list, selfies, inside your fridge, you can draw, etcâ€¦"
13,Iâ€™d probably get better FPS using the potato than the Reddit video player will give you when you try to watch a video.
14,They all have better network than Switch Online
15, removing mematic Watermark is a waste of money

27,"Okay let's weigh the options.

Potato: Portable but rots.

Samsung Smart Fridge: Bulky but good.

KFConsole: Portable and can fry chicken.

McDonald's Kiosk: Bulky but can run Doom.


So honestly the Fridge and the Kiosk should be off the list right off the bat because of their bulkiness.
The Potato is a good option but it rots and can degrade the performance.

The only valid option would be the KFConsole which is very portable and can always prepare a snack."
28,The potato just really goes with my rooms aesthetic already
29,Smart fridge games and snacks in front of your eyes
30,samsung smart fridge because it can never overheat

37,Can I get a big mac?
38,Kfconsole as the tastiest
39,Whatever KFC'S got
40,"kfc, and heres why:

&#x200B;

Potato: Console is food. Console disappears when eaten.

&#x200B;

Fridge: Console contains food, but food is uncooked. You have to step away from the game to cook the food. You also have to hack it in order to play the game.

  
MdD's Kiosk: You have to place an order for your food and then wait for it to be made. when it arrives, you find out they gave you the wrong sauce. Like the fridge, it needs to be hacked in order to play the game. The employees also ask you to ""stop gaming on the kiosk so other customers can order"" and  tell you ""You can't hack our machine sir, please leave"" and other stupid nonsense. It's really annoying.

&#x200B;

KFC console: Food is cooked while you game, guaranteed to come out with the correct sauce because you grabbed the sauce yourself. It's your own console so no one else can tell you how to use it. Also, it has Colonal Sander's Dating Simulator on it. It doesn't need to be hacked to be used, it just works. It has at least 1.5 times the computing power of the potato. Seriously, there are no cons to this console."

46,I have a Samsung smart fridge
47,I got plenty of experience with the potato anyway
48,"Since i don't know what hardware the KFConsole packs, i'll go with the kiosk. Its an embedded windows machine with a gigantic touchcsreen, can probably do some whack stuff with it."
