28,"Will you guys ever stop crying? I've got news for you, your generation is not the first to face adversity. It's just that you guys cry louder than any generation before you.

It comes from your childhood upbringing. As kids you cried so loud when your team came in last place that they started giving you trophies for losing,  just to shut you the hell up. 

Adulthood and the real world doesn't work that way. So now, being forced to accept that reality, your entire generation has reverted to the tactic that got them this far, crying as loud as they possibly can. 

On behalf of Generation X, and every generation that came before us, will you please stfu, man up, put your head down and get to work. Please. Our ears are ringing."

63,"ok, here's some advice for you: your advice isn't ""good,"" it's useless. 

""protect yourself"" isn't advice. it's like saying to people in the military ""don't get shot by the predictable bullets"" - thanks for the fucking genius tip. 

also, telling people not to complain on reddit--LOL 

you poor thing. maybe you should have protected yourself from the predictable reddit complaining"

65,"This meme is taking the viewpoint that this generation is somehow unique and perhaps worse off in regards to the number of economic crises.  It's not.  It's just self pity mind set and not constructive in any way shape or form on top of being objectively false.   


Down turns in the economy are predictable and can be planned for.  It's not bad advice or useless to suggest people should plan for them.  It's common sense that used to be just the way people lived until the last few decades where more and more people live in a victim mentality and only worry about what they are able to consume rather than save.  But now you say it and people lose their minds like you are some sort of monster lacking compassion.  No, dudes, me caring for your future is why I saw to pull your head out of your ass and prepare for the next cycle in the economy."

67,"lol no. you're not going to just casually victim blame on this one

you're sitting there trying to make it seem like 2008 and covid just happen all the time (talk about ""objectively false"") and people should have ""just planned for it"" 

keep trying chief. keep working hard and one day you'll actually look like you know what you're talking about"

69,For over a century recessions and/or depressions have been happening to the American economy every 8 to 14 years.  It's predictable.  To live as if they weren't ever going to happen is silly and nonsensical.  Have you ever heard of the ant and the grasshopper?  It's a tale told dating back since centuries ago about this very thing because it's been a mainstay of every civilization in history.  Prepare for the inevitable bad times while enjoying the bounty of the good times.  I learned that via Looney toons when I was a child.
