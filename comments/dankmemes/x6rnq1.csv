0,"My father once farted so bad at a party that they had to empty the house. The whole house. I was young, but if I remember right it was a modified double wide of stone sort, with a basement.

 Problem was it was a sci-fi fan club party and one guy was in the process of casting his whole head to make a Klingon prosthetic. It took about 10 minutes before someone was like ""hey! Where's *insert name* "" He was left alone, in silence, with no explanation and nothing but straws up his nose to breathe through. I was mortified by the whole ordeal."
