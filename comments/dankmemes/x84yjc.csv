55,Maybe that's what I feel. In any case my brain gets overloaded and pressure in my head feels like it's increases.
56,"Combine that with some Aspbergers and you have me.
Fuck, do i wish i wasnt me so Manny times every day…."

58,"Nah nah, you definitely fuck. Have a blessed day."
59,I feel that. Must be tough being such a chad
60,"That was me, got diagnosed as an adult."
61,Ay man. You ain’t gotta be diagnosed to feel the struggles sometimes. Just don’t go saying you have ADHD or ADD until diagnosed tho
62,"It’s crazy how many people say it while being un diagnosed looking for attention. But keep moving forward king, it won’t slow you down"
63,I know about not telling people about undiagnosed diagnoses.
64,"I'm not looking for attention. If I could, I'd get a diagnosis."
65,"That’s what I’m saying King, don’t worry. I know you ain’t looking for attention. Hope you have a wonderful day"
66,Thanks
