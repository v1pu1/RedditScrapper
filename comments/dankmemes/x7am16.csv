0,Looks like what you eat in monster hunter
1,"Teacher:no reposting the same meme with different gifs

Kids in the back row:"
2,"One girl who sat in the back had a blood sugar problem (don’t remember which one). Would regularly pull out food from her bag, place it on her desk, and eat it while staring at the teacher. Never even had to bring in a doctor’s note."
3,I watch this guy! His names CZN Burak hes a great chef if u were wondering
4,"As a student that sat in the back 1/4 of a school year, I can confirm that we make ourselves 5 star gourmet meals everyday."
5,I love watching this dude
6,Meh it's been done
7,POV: A light meal for the characters in Monster Hunter
8,As a middle school math teacher I can attest to this.... Had a kid legit eating a turkey dinner in my class once.
9,Where can you buy food like this
10,This reminds me of Asterix & Obelix.
11,Thats just a pile of meat it looks disgusting
12,One of my favorite games of all time.
13,Yeah but now I keep picturing a cooked ostrich
14,Back of the class buddy
15,Les bonnes ref
16,Bro it's on a pile of rice and stuffed with veggies. Do you not see that?
17,It's... It's a turkey
18,Probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this aren't I?
19,Yeah food this size usually doesnt taste that good
20,Folks'll say that it takes two people to cook an ostrich.
21,Still
22,The rice would cook so much faster than the bird. Also the bell peppers were a visual choice as you'd want to use aromatics here. Doing this all in one pot is just for the optics.
23,Idk seem more like and ostrich lol
24,Doesn't look tasty as long as it's in separate prices rather than one massive chunk of meat
25,Of course. It's pretty rude to talk about your mom like that
26,"I dont think its rice. Its bulgur, a popular dish from Turkey, same as CZN Burak is from.

Unless Im mistaken, but that definitely looks like bulgur pilav from here."
27,Damn
28,DAMN
29,Dang
30,Damn
