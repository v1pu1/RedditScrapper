1,I don’t think the creator wants to talk to you… or anyone
2,"Honestly the concept for the game was great, it was just the creator, yanderedev, is just the worst game developer in history, the dude has spent the last 10 years developing a game, getting money from patreon, using all unity assets and has only developed one rival in over ten years when there should be like 5 or 6 rivals. The man has just been drinking from the cum chalice and banning everyone who asks about how the game development is going from his discord.

End rant."
