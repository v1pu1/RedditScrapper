4,The Daily Show is a comedy show that makes fun of the news. It's not a legitimate news source. Fox News is Right-wing propaganda standing next to legitimate news sources.
5,Mass media is a propaganda machine.  Unfortunately a large portion of the population is too stupid or too infatuated with what the outlets spew every day that they won't stop watching.
6,All methods of communication are machines for the creation of propaganda.
