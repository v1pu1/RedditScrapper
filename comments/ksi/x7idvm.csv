0,"I don’t like Jake but his events aren’t that bad.

Order should be,
KSI V Logan 2
KSI V Logan 1
Jake V Gib
KSI V Joe
Deji V Wassabi
KSI V Swarmz
I know there is one more but the image is so pixelated I can’t see what it is.

IMO Creator Clash is up there somewhere between KSI v Logan 1 and Jake v Gib"
1,Jake vs gib was fine
2,Logan Paul vs KSI was heavily better than KSI’s recent event. It was one of the biggest YouTubers from both countries. His recent one was with people who aren’t as known.
3,Are you ranking event by how well organized they were or by how happy you were with results?
4,Idubbz event was lowkey good
5,"Creator clash was amazing lmfao , u seem a wee bit like a ksi stan ngl"
6,We don’t talk about that bro the way we were hyping gib up so much still love gib tho lmao
7,That Deji win was goat tier alone and salt papi knock out was sexy bruh and kenny vs sensei was great and slim shocking most people now tell me how tf ain’t that great
8,Seems like he ranked them on how happy he was with the results lol
9,We hyped him up because Jake vs deji was bad…but jake fighting deji and jake fight gib skill level was so different
10,"Because the main event was completely lacking which brings it down imo. Undercard was definitely better, but the main event is what we all wanna see, and Ksi v Logan delivered an exciting main event both times"
