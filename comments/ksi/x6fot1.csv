43,"i like it, but why is there a circular arrow around one side of jj? just curious :)"

46,Crop out both faces and show them to random people. Guaranteed they will say Logan bit no idea who the other one is.
47,"That's a different argument, the question is that can u make anything like that?"
48,But that was my argument and then you made it into you cant draw better so your opinion is invalid. The fact is that his drawing of KSIs face sucks. Whether or not I could draw it better doesnt matter.
