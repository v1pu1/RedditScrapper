69,Yea ofc. But when I said she had good health I mean for the long term. Living for 97 years is very good and considered good health.
70,"Just do it like Smosh for their funerals, have them each get in a coffin, and have them write some roasts about each other. Vikk lookin like he could toast some of them alive with his roasts."
71,Niko: I was the Queen's secret 3rd daughter that dressed up as prince charles only to become black and start a youtube channel
72,"That would be insane, just imagine."
73,good bot
74,That could work
