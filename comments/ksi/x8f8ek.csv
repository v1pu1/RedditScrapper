1,"Get Justaminx back in the ring, she was great in the Creator Clash and she was also Irish"
2,Faith vs Mia
3,Minx's fight in creator clash was hype.
4,"JustaMinx is looking for a new opponent, would be nice to put her on a card with someone. I think IDubbz girlfriend would be down to fight too but probably not on a Different promotion ik they have their own promotion too."
5,"Fuck it

Pokemane vs Alinity

Make it happen"
6,Minx slugfest. OF and PH interactions are cringe af.
7,Justaminx vs Haley 2.0 their fight was actually dope. No blocks all punches
8,W2S vs Talia
9,I would LOVE to see this but don’t really know any female YouTubers that would be down to fight. I’m a bit clouded in the sidemen bubble
10,Depends who. Need big names that are willing to take it seriously.
11,Would like to see Elle Brooke get her face smashed in. Ik she’s a PH star but still
12,Get Justaminx back she was throwing bombs 😂
13,"Minx needs to fight again, she kicked major ass"
14,no offence but am I the only one who find this template cringe?
15,To be fair though …
16,No
17,Stfu
18,Would love to see KSI vs Freya 😂😂
19,Minx vs Alinity?
20,Dunjahh vs alinity would be kinda interesting tho
21,Bambino Becky needs to be on it
22,Minx vs Deji's ex gf
23,Yo lets do yt and pornstars i rly wanna see belle delphine vs mia kalifha
24,Don't let Mike pick the women it will just be every porn star from pornhubs leaderboard.
25,"I dunno a lot about womens sports, aside from it being less profitable due to lots of factors out of the control of the women participating.
But I honestly think they deserve more spotlight in general, and this would be a good way of going about it."
26,The female fights are kinda fun to watch tho
27,Like minx 💀
28,Justaminx is a solid choice for the undercard
29,Why not though.
30,Why do you care?
31,Yes
32,U know the only woman YouTubers are of models and stars of a very popular website
33,OF Models & pornstars is a good idea tbh. Should do 2v2 fights lmao
34,Talia vs Julia jakes girl
35,Minx
36,Ricegum can fill for women's place 😂😂 ( strenght would be a bit less tho )
37,"i mean, yeah women empowerment and everything but honestly nobody gives two fucks, we just want to watch Baldski beating the fuck outta jake."
38,W2s sister vs Talia
39,What? whats wrong with what it is now?.
40,Jj: “we would but no girls want to fight”
41,Why?
42,Sam Hyde vs Hassan needs to happen
43,No it'd be boring. Nothing against women boxing but it'd be boring. It's like NBA v WNBA.
44,Mia Malkova vs Faith 😅
45,What about Xvideos?
46,Talia vs JJ for the co-main
47,I would be down for Amanda Serrano vs Katie Taylor 2. Also Idubbbz gf vs Justaminx
48,There's already enough cringe with male fights 🤣. I can't imagine how bad female presses would be.
49,"That would be kinda dead tbh, girl beef just ain’t the same. No hate to all the beautiful women out here    But I don’t think anyone would want to watch it."
50,Justaminx vs the girl who said jj faking being a fighter
51,Expected these comments tbf
52,Nah
53,fuck no
54,Nah noone wants to see that
55,No offence but it would be really hard to find a fight between two women which would be a better fight than two men. Just saying whenever a fight is announced on the card that takes up a slot. I think it’s a shitty idea.
56,No
57,No.
58,Nah.
59,Fangs V Justaminx
60,Idk tbh but it has to be someone who takes it seriously
61,Idk personally there isnt any female id like to see in the ring

75,But then Andrew Tate won’t fight we all no he doesn’t like women and can’t be around them
76,"Simon miniminter is a girl isnt she? 

Get her on a card"
77,Why ???? What difference does it make??? The answer is it doesn't because the womens fights don't bring in numbers they're just a waste of time and money because hardly any of them take it seriously like the Ken do and the fights end up being absolutely dreadful
78,andrew tate: WHO WANTS TO WATCH WOMEN FIGHT???
79,No
80,No. Don’t do this.
