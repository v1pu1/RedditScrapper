0,I’m guessing the 2 first big spikes were both KSI vs Logan Paul fights
1,Thing is people would also search for “JJ Olatunji” or “JJ Sidemen” too so he would have even higher results.
2,"Wow tate has similar graphs to island boys, wonder what's gonna happen next?"
3,Interesting
4,Just stop talking about him 😂
5,Those 2 little spikes after the 2nd Logan fight were when the albums dropped right?
6,"This whole KSI Vs Andrew divided people, it's like a  civil war for YTubers lol."
7,How do you measure interest 🤔
8,I mean.. most of Tate's fans would be toddlers back in 2017
9,where do you search these
10,Well AndPew tate Has just reached his fame like 3 months ago while JJ has been doing this for a while.
11,And I’m assuming that the first small spike is the Joe Weller fight
12,"Yea your right, and Andrew Tate only goes by Andrew Tate"
13,"Google trends doesn’t only work by exact searches. It takes the topic, KSI, then incorporates everything related to KSI and puts it under 1 umbrella."
14,Andrew Tate the new island boy confirmed
