1,This guy wilddd af
2,“he got his start in 2019” 😂
3,Dam JJ the real alpha getting over 30m subs in one year on all the different channels
4,2019💀
5,There not many of us. Hit 30 this year and still watching.
6,"Thats awsome, i turned 25 a month ago, but to think what JJ has accomplished over all these years in insane, he really did everything he wanted to do, and after all these years i can still think back on some silly videos he made and laugh, like im on a horse Heskey time or road to division 1, i dont even need to see it that's how funny some of his videos really are."
7,"Honestly I try not to because he puts me to shame with how much he's achieved compared to myself. Love the guy though, his content isn't as good as it used to be but he is edging 30 and it wouldn't feel right if his content stayed the same. He's matured well and his content reflects that."
8,"I agree at the end it's only good his content changes as his personality does we all do over time. 

And i understand what you are saying, but please don't even think like that ever again, we all have different paths and ways in life some are harder some are easier and at the end i view everyone equal nobody is better or less then me, the world needs you just as much as the world needs JJ."
9,"Appreciate it my man, im not one to compare myself to others but when I look at how much he's done I think ""damn, I gotta grind harder"". Its more like a morale boost to work harder than a dig at myself."
