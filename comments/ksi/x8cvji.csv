1,"Nah im not having it, just because someone disagree with something your not a fan all the sudden, maybe the case for some but not all, i love JJ i really do but he also makes mistakes like the rest of us and thats ok, i dont always agree with him or like everything he does, i dont have to but because of that for an example i would not be a fan thats bs imo."
2,Nah he isn’t immune to criticism. Mams look like some dickeater anyway.
3,"No because most of the time people say I'm a ksi fan but, they just say the most outlandish stupid thing that you wouldn't say as a fan even with criticism"
4,Just don't start with I'm a ksi fan
5,You missed the point lol
6,Agree to disagree then
7,"I get what he is trying to say, but i dont agree that's my opinion, so now i have to like everything JJ does or im not considered a fan i don't understand, i have been watching and enjoying JJ for over 12 years, in those years i never complained, im just saying i feel like i should be able to say im a KSI fan but i dont like how he handles this particular reason, 

If i did miss the point please explain because im dutch, and maybe im a little lost in translation or just over thinking it, there's no hate towards anyone just to be clear."
8,So you really missed the point
9,Explain please
10,"Literally said JJ takes constructive criticism, no one said you have to agree with everything. Just majority of the “I’m a KSI fan but” comments are hate or stupid comments"
11,"I definitely misunderstood it then im sorry, thanks for explaining it my friend."
