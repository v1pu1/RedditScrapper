1,"Man's a mastermind with a long term plan. 
 Just layers over layers, niko for World Leader."
2,Niko always comes with banger videos 🔥
3,I was so focused during the live on KSI and him jumping that I didn't see behind him. Man literally showed his face and we were oblivious to it.
4,Tbf this is the same Niko that completely finessed the leader of the KKK so it ain't surprising
5,NIKO is actually a true 🐐
6,We all got finessed
7,I was wondering if he was doing a video on it.  Seen him in there behind Ksi and thought must of been part of the show.
8,Well now we know he’s def planning something for January.
9,WHAT

25,I saw it but I didn’t realise it was Niko cause I wasn’t paying a ton of attention I just remember thinking “I thought that prime bottle guy looked different”

29,There’s an entire video on it for you to watch that says otherwise
30,There’s an entire video genius
31,everyone just thought Niko asked Kysha if he could wear it instead. No one thought even then Niko was behind it all.
32,"Yeah but how didn’t any of us see this coming , like he did so well"
33,"Yeah exactly, if the lighting was better the whole crowd would have gone mad seeing niko in the ring live"
