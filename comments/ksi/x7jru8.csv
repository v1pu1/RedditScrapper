0,"probs post fight food binge/ water retention and taking break off from training, nothing abnormal with the physique"
1,Don't talk shit about fusy he turn up. He was not bad. He was better than JJ's both opponent combined. His performance was not something to critique
2,Lmao every talking about his abs going away and saying he was on the needle has obviously never had abs before
3,Knocked the gains out of him
4,From wolf to dog
5,Bro no way he got a dad bod from being jacked in 10 days
6,The physique fosey had wasn't sustainable without a LOT of effort what's wrong with that picture
7,He ate like Paddy after the fight
8,He made him From Dog to Wolf by calling out then beated the fuck out of him and made him a snail
9,FR
10,Bro you can't talk the talk and then not walk the walk
11,Why does he look like a sex offender from south London?
12,Where his beard run off too
13,"Deji really sat Fousey down after all the ""experience in life"" Fousey had. Wolf? Hahahaha in his wildest dreams."
14,"Y’all need to remember that this is probably similar to how he normally looks when he’s under bad lighting + slouching. And then add on the post fight food binge he had, AND not being able to workout for a week due to surgery. He’ll probably get back into shape in no time. (And for those of you who are saying “steroids lmao hurdur” you clearly have no idea how basic body biology works. This would be a pretty poor physic if he was on steroids anyway."
15,he looks like chihuahua
16,W fousey he making his money you guys are haters. also W Deji for winning
17,[deleted]
18,he had to be on steroids theres no way
19,I hope he doesn't take the loss too personally and revert back to his old ways.
20,"I’m sure he’s going through it right now, but he’s been there before many times. He’ll be back in gym once he heals/get his nose fixed."
21,Damm his abs went away rather quickly😂
22,respect to him nonetheless
23,"Stfu with this pussy post. Both gave their all, fousey blocked with his head, end of the story. What's the fucking point of this post anyway? Can you personally even do/achieve what his single pube did? Gtfo from here."
24,"Huge respect to Fousey for stepping on the ring and showing big heart, I wish him a speedy recovery."
25,"idk why this guy is so cringe to me .. even before all this boxing stuff ..
and i hate the talk shit then become spiritual and wanted to be  ""inspiring"" bs"
26,"Inshallah he recovers , I saw a god loving humble Fousey in that ring and I hope he keeps to his good ways"
27,He beat him Fit to chubby
28,"He looks fine what you on about? Dude just finished a fight and now is enjoying food and not working out nearly as much, that's pretty normal."
29,"He still looks great if you ask me, oh you didn't. I'll show my self out"
30,I guess he won’t box ever again
31,"Never been a wolf, just a barking puppy"
32,Hes still way stronger than I am and probably almost everyone on here. Let's actually focus on our health and train.
33,Fat depressed manic fousey incoming
34,The pack is gone already?

60,Bro aged backwards 💀

67,Nice Giants hat thou
68,He’s more realistic now that he’s of the roids 😂😂😂
69,Abs gone in one week 😭
70,man went from alpha wolf to beta wolf
71,"Honestly though. Kids in here talking without understanding what bloat is and that a simple meal and glass of water can make muscle tone and definition ""disappear"" temporarily"
72,"This comment a real one. Dude did bits and stayed humble in the end. Put some respect on his name.

Just to add, this is bloating, a major side effect from having gone through extreme dehydration to make weight for fights. He’s still lean, his body is just trying to take in all the water he lost."

74,He's a roidhead who can't box.
75,"He was, on their level. Idk."
76,Plus I'm assuming he went to surgery and got confined if not close to being bed-ridden. People think you maintain abs even when doing nothing lmao.
77,"Abs are temporary, technique is forever. Most good boxers aren't jacked."
78,True but he was quite obviously using gear also
79,"He doesn't have to be on needle.

Anavar and winstrol come in a form of pills."
80,"He is still physically very lean at like 15-10% bodyfat.
If he didnt just eat a meal, was under better lighting, wasnt drinking as much water.
He would probably still have rock solid abs maybe not as clear as before tho.
Having no abs doesnt mean your fat kids."
81,Check his ig and twitter he said he ate a bunch of ice cream and other unhealthy stuff after the loss. And that he got kind of “depressed” but that he wont give up
82,If that’s a dad bod holy shit I’m overweight
83,Bro doesn't know what a dad bod is💀
84,Lol i cant find dad bod bro...
85,Check his ig and twitter he said he ate a bunch of ice cream and other unhealthy stuff after the loss. And that he got kind of “depressed” but that he wont give up
86,"He put up a fight, your talking and you'd get bodied by fousey or probably any other human"
87,It’s recent but abs can go away pretty quickly
88,"Steroids aren’t actually haram tho. Unless you’re using them for haram intentions and straying away from Allah. 

But yes, he was on tren"
89,"yea there is a high chance, but nonetheless do go away quickly if he isn't exercising, he just got beat so I doubt he is doing any training"
90,Probably not exercising and just eating having abs all the time is hard to do
91,Gone
92,"I mean, it doesn't even make sense for him to train until his next fight is announced

He needs to rest now after that fight Deji gave him"
93, fousey said he got sad and ate a bunch and bunch of ice cream. On his ig and twitter its sad man
94,facts fousey deserves all the respect. he fought someone who was better than ksi on the night.
95,Check his ig and twitter he said he ate a bunch of ice cream and other unhealthy stuff after the loss. And that he got kind of “depressed” but that he wont give up
96,Have a look in the mirror mate. You’re not2good yourself
97,[removed]
98,"You dont lose abs just like that, it takes time"
99,He is lean and not big . I think he is natty
100,Issa joke
