3,"Lol she literally solidified that ""curse"" more than any other British monarch"
4,Tf is wrong with you lot
5,Everything has a cost
6,Omggggg‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..üòÇ I‚Äôm sorry but this is funny

10,i apologize to those who find it offensive
11,What a shit post. This joke is so bad it makes no sense or has any correlation at all. Just stfu
12,Downvote
13,How can LONG LIVE the queen be classified as a curse üò≠
14,"Mate it's highly unlikely that you will live to 96 or even close to 96, this is a stupid post."

16,Wdym she lived 96 years she lived a long life
17,Your so stupid bruv
18,Good riddance
19,Not funny at all - seriously these kids have zero mental capability
20,Bruh
21,"Pretty sure it was based around the joke that the Queen can't die

Obviously no normal person thought that but yeah"
22,She was a living fossil at this point
23,I wanna live to 102 so I can see the year turn to 2100
24,shit i thought she was at one point
25,Chill out. Not everyone is British.
26,Init
27,Your mum is a queen for raising you
28,She‚Äôs done so many terrible things that have been swept under the rug that this is the time where the general population feels safe to air their grievances about her realm. Not saying it‚Äôs right or wrong but you have to understand how people feel.
29,Not even British but it‚Äôs kinda sad. I always knew this day would come but it‚Äôs so weird. Like she was a Queen when Churchill was a PM.
30,"Come one bro, I‚Äôm Muslim, not allowed to even pray for her, but bro respect the dead"
31,I only have to make it to 97... :-) üôèüôè
32,It‚Äôs basic decency to show respect and not take the piss out of someone who just passed away don‚Äôt matter where they‚Äôre from.
33,"Bruh what, lmao"
34,Thanks man.
35,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay for people to literally celebrate her death and party about it, that shit is weird asf"
36,Respect brother
37,Nah bro the wicked witch is finally dead. From defending her child molester son to doing nothing about concentration camps in kenya to insulting Margaret Thatcher to playing a role in colonialism https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/queen-elizabeths-death-revives-criticism-britains-legacy-colonialism-rcna46942
38,"Granted by that time pretty sure if we don't kill ourselves off, we be able go cyborg."
39,Here is a thing you don't understand.  I doubt people who where from colonies care about that Decency.
40,Nah bro. From defending her child molester son to doing nothing about concentration camps in kenya to insulting Margaret Thatcher to playing a role in colonialism https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/queen-elizabeths-death-revives-criticism-britains-legacy-colonialism-rcna46942
41,I‚Äôm not comparing her and hitler but the impact she has had on many colonial populations is very similar to the impact hitler had but despite this it is never talked about. The Jewish population was joyous to hear of hitlers demise and similarly many colonial populations who died and suffered in crown inflicted famines and wars rightly feel a similar joyous attitude to the queens passing.
42,"The queen didn‚Äôt really have much to do with any of that though. It was her family before her. Whilst she was queen, the empire was already falling apart with many nations getting their independence. She even helped make sure all the commonwealth had aid to help the countries. I‚Äôm not a fan of the royals especially the ones before her, but she did the best she could tbh"
43,So who was it that collaborated with Churchill to take grain from bengalis causing the greatest famine in human history with a total of 20 million bengalis dying
44,You mean in 1943 when she wasn‚Äôt even Queen and had no say in it? It was Churchill himself brudda
45,"You‚Äôre actually right, my fault I was thinking about the India Pakistan partition which killed hundreds of thousands on both sides just because the queen felt that there should be a line drawn through the country"
46,"Again, 1947, before she was even queen and had any say. British civil servant Sir Cyril Radcliffe drew up the borders between India and Pakistan, in 1947"
47,I‚Äôm addition to this she authorized the separation of the middle eastern states controlled by the British in a way that divided nations and ethnic groups and pitted nations against themselves in an effort to increase the western control over middle eastern oil
48,"Once again, an event that happened before her reign."
49,"Lad those lines were drew before she was even born. Fran√ßois Georges-Picot and Mark Sykes drew up Ottoman lands in 1916 around areas the British and French had invested into. The San Remo Resolution passed in 25 April 1920 would settle the final status of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia."
