0,It's on the shelves in my local asda and tbh it's nice but I wouldn't pay more than £2 a bottle. It's got more flavour than most drinks but that's about it
1,"""hundreds of dollars""💀"
2,Hundreds of dollars on a fucking energy drink that you're not even gonna drink all but sell. How stupid are you lol
3,"Simping over a girl is 1 thing but simping over a drink is a whole new level of waisting your time.

21,“Hundreds of dollars” bro come on that’s a new low

28,This guy gets it
29,Gatorade is ass

31,NZ?
32,казахстан угрожает нам бомбардировкой
33,Hopefully no one’s dumb enough to spend $20 on a fkn drink
34,Seeing as you said you spent “hundreds” so at least $200 on it and there’s 12 bottles at $20 sale so $240 that’s only $40 profit best case scenario but you probably spent more than $200 and prob keeping a couple for yourself to try so likely you’re losing money big man. Calling himself a drug dealer lmaooo
35,Scum.
36,Lol dorkiest comment of the year.

41,"Bro you spent hundreds of dollars and months for juice 💀 

Ngl you kinda a 🤡"
42,If it’s ass why did Prime base their drink off of drinks like Gatorade?
43,Northern Ireland.. swear everyone thinks we are just the same as Ireland lol
44,I sold them all except a couple for me and my friend
45,‘I wouldn’t pay more than £2 for it’ oh same man how much is it? ‘£1.50’😂😂😂 where did you get the £2 from man?😂😂
46,"I'm just tryna get some prime man, it's all out of stock at burgh heath"
47,Then i hope he will at least get some cool points in school
48,Nobody is paying 20 for a energy drink that's at the corner store for 2 dollars
49,No clue about that…
50,🧢 nothing to be proud of
51,"For an on the go drink, £1.50 is reasonable. A 50p increase is massive for a drink lol."
52,The title?
53,It’s obviously not at the corner
54,I live in NZ the dollar value is weak ish and import tax plus shipping so it added up. Plus it’s not meant to be a business. I wanted a bottle to drink but it would cost like $50 for one bottle this way I’m “essentially” getting it for free…
55,"Tbf a bottle of Gatorade is £1.10 in Tesco in subway it’s £2, less fluid in the bottle then a bottle of prime too, but my point is where did the £2 come from lol, if it’s £1.50 why would you need to pay £2 for it?"
56,"Oh sorry, OP spent loads of money on the drinks to import it and actually have it. I was saying its not worth more than £2 like you’d be disappointed if you paid that or more"
57,"Did he edit his post?😂 I would buy a bottle if I saw it in a shop, I wouldn’t even mind pay £2, if I ordered it with food like delivery and they said £2.50 I even wouldn’t mind that too much as they put cans of coke at like £1.80 and shit lol, but no way I’d spend 100’s of dollars and wait for months just to have some bottles unless I was young and at school and could flip them easily but then I’d be wondering where I got the money in the first place😂 so to just have them idk, that’s a bit mad but, however a man wants to spend his dough I guess😂"
58,I live in NZ which is literally the furthest from a country with Prime
59,"Right, I live in the UK, haven’t had it yet, constantly sold out and that, doesn’t mean I’m gonna spend 100’s of pounds and wait months just so I can have it, how many bottles did you buy and how much did you actually spend? As I said it’s entirely up to you how you spend your dough but it’s a bit excessive enit😂"
60,"In fact I wouldn’t even bother going to the shop to buy some for retail if my friend rang me right now to say they have it in stock, if I was in the shop and it was there I’d buy it, but as I said it’s your bread brother💪"
61,197NZD for 12
62,The prime it self was only 50USD but the import tax and crazy shipping to NZ prices added up
63,Broooo genuinely feel bad that’s terrible man I hope you’re an Elon alt bro😔
