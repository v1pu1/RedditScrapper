0,Okay..... Hold on a second... Crypto?! He lost more money there than he gained from it.
1,"Adidas, footasylum, jd sponsor"
2,Wasn’t adidas another one? He wore it in Its not over yet
3,Real estate
4,Adidas and the other language for the sidemen channel
5,I’ve read somewhere to dude owns like 2-3 blocks in London real estate. Something no one really accounts for. Also the KSI shorts channel isn’t him it’s some Indian kid apparently.
6,"He had an adidas collab, also I’m not sure if he still does it a lot but he has done real estate, and I don’t think he gets money from KSI clips somebody else owns and made the channel"
7,sidecards
8,"He has his own merch site outside of the sidemen

He could also make some money from his book sales (both from I am a bellend and the sidemen book)

He made a movie that people can buy"
9,Forgot KSIs only fans
10,And TONS of real estate
11,ksi clips isnt his
12,Adidas
13,beats sponsorship
14,"Just like boxing+misfit boxing 


There's also music + his music label."
15,I mean if you have crypto and nfts listed he probably has normal stocks and a savings account that gains interest
16,"I don't think he makes money from KSI Clips, it's not his channel"
17,He owns properties that are on rent
18,"tiktok, there’s no way that he doesnt invest his money there’s even a chance he have a private businesses too"
19,"Prime, obviously"
20,"I think Crypto is actually WHERE some of these other incomes spawned from, mans has to make up for his Ls 😂😂😂"
21,I’m pretty sure KSI has properties too he’s invested in
22,Adidas sponsorship
23,He’s probably got a ton more we don’t know about but that list alone is insane. Such diverse income streams
24,Funny how jake says he’s clear of ksi when all jake has is boxing and his shitty podcast and he can’t even sell out a boxing arena or get more than 200 k views on a podcast
25,Also..... What's sides vodka? Sounds cool 😂
26,Lets just stop for a minute and think about this post. Dont you have smarter things to do in life rather than worrying about KSI's income? Like what the hell is wrong with you people?
27,bro doing side missions at this point
28,"As well as soundcore,cause he's repping it almost everywhere so it makes it pretty obvious that he has a sponsorship deal with anker."
29,"He doesn’t make money from the clips channel, it’s the “Indian Kid” that makes the money from it"
30,"he doesn't own KSIclips btw, not his channel."
31,Ksi clips is not JJs channel
32,"Clips isn’t his channel, he also has adidas and that headphone brand sponsorship"
33,Concerts :)
34,We should probably say Crypto is him spending money not earning.
35,"G fuel? Never seen him be sponsored by them in the last 5 years atleast (not sure, might be wrong), KSI Clips isn’t being run by him and also he’s stated multiple times that if anything he loses money from the jj olatunji channel and crypto.
