0,looks like a mugshot
1,Good record not bad 2 KOs he should have fought him instead of pineda
2,"Personally I think itâ€™s a good challenge, not too good but has the credibility of being Wilders Brother"
3,Could be good tbf
4,"Just no... from the little I've seen of this guy he is skilled boxer, with a powerful jab. He's not a good boxer by pro standards, but he would beat JJ with ease.

Also JJ would have to come up to cruiserweight which makes it even harder for him. There's no point picking fights he can't win."
5,Noo I donâ€™t wanna have to witness jj get knocked out
6,"No. What we need now is someone who we have all seen box before. Jj claimed that Swarmz and Pineda crumbled because of his power, and they are quite good, so let's get someone established, like Tyron Woodley, or Tommy Fury, and see if that really is the case."
7,I saw the picture and thought why is there a criminal in jj subreddit and then i read the title of the post
8,Bro got that 1/2 star rating yeah he's hard
9,It would be a good match and to be honest I don't think JJ will fight him as he has huge respect towards deontay.
10,No
11,Bring on Deontay I wanna see KSI lose
12,He should but would JJ win?
13,what opponent? if boxing JJ has a good chanve of winning but if it's a beard-off then JJ might lose idk man
14,If I had to verse him Iâ€™d simply leave
15,Pretty good record. U should go for it jj.
16,"Higher win ratio to losses, should be a nice match up, doesnâ€™t need to be about clout with JJ as he will still sell out tickets regardless who heâ€™s fighting"
17,Looks like a mug shot bruh ðŸ˜‚
18,I mean it would be better than that pineda fight
19,Stop looking at low end fighters and saying they oh pro this and that
20,this could actually be a good fight for deji
21,Rating lower than Pineda nope
22,Why he looks like his Mother whooped his ahh and forced him to take the pic? Lmao
23,"I think it's a pretty good fight. Marsellos is coming off two losses back to back. Fighting JJ would give him the clout and the bag. He'd be a good challenge for JJ, a win against Marsellos would do wonders to JJ's confidence and the whole YT Boxing community. JJ's all about upping the levels. This really is a level up."
24,Why he look more sleepy than Swarmz???
25,Now he gonna take on fury and wilder in one nightâ€¦would blow the internet!
26,Did you even check the rating
27,Bro I thought he was in prison
28,L
29,Rating: 0.5/5 Stars
30,Walmart Wilder!
31,Why does he look like he's just been arrested
32,Man looks like he about to be thrown in the cell for dropping the soap
33,Any pro boxer that knows how to throw a punch its not a good match up. So if this dude canâ€™t throw one than its good
34,Another silly boxing fan making silly posts. Anything goes on this sub
35,Niggas rated half a starâ€¦ you telling me thatâ€™s what JJ would be ranked?
36,"Prefect match-up, Never knew You could find an opponent with a patchy beard worse than Jj'sðŸ˜­"
37,This is actually a really good opponent on paper tbh. Wilder would promote it to. Bqsically just as good as Tommy fury
38,Ayo could work
39,Deontay Wilder and Marsellos Domestic make a dynamic duo rivaling the olatunji's. We should have DW fighting Deji as well.
40,Lmao no
41,I wanna see ksi fight Andrew Tate
42,Deon wildlife
43,"Nah ksi needs to fight a good opponent even if that means losing, his mindset will allow him to win any fight, ANTONY JOSHUA DON'T WANT DA SMOKE"
44,Won't sell.
45,racially motivated
46,"No he shouldnâ€™t, this fight looks like a challenge, which is great when your in form, ksi was out of form due to the long time between fights. Therefore he took an easier option like he should.

Now rust has wore off, yes this guy would be a good fight"
47,Being someone's brother does not mean anything. Deontay's hard work is not inherited by his brother. We don't even know if they ever trained together or if both of them like each other.
48,"He loses to journeymen, ksi has a chance imo"
49,Dw he isnâ€™t like Deontay
50,wait did you say swarmz and pineda are quite good
51,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
52,JJ literally said heâ€™d fight Gib lol
53,Respect doesn't keep people from pursuing professional boxing matches lmao. Not every fight has to be because there's beef. I'd be willing to reckon that the large majority of big-time boxers all respect each other. Doesn't mean they won't try to beat the shit out of each other in the ring
54,Pressed ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
55,probably not
56,"I say him cuz he has a winning record, a good step up which can lead him to bigger fights"
57,Whyâ€™re u on smoke bru itâ€™s just a suggestionðŸ¤£
58,Deji owns Deontay tbh
59,bro whats up with u
60,"This looks and sounds like sarcasm, why are people downvoting you ðŸ˜­"
61,Calm down cupcake
62,you're racially motivated because you linked a black person with a mugshot
63,People are taking this so seriously...
64,Makes sense but he could have taken the risk and hype the event more for more revenue as his comeback fight. Anyway it is all Alex wassabiâ€™s fault
65,That makes no sense. He was out of form before the Pineda swarmz fight but now he's in form? So beating them actually improved his skills? Don't think that's how it works. You get into form in the gym. He was definitely not out of form in those fights.
66,"I mean, Tommy is tyson furyâ€™s brother and heâ€™s not that good but still gets called out"
67,"don't be silly bro... if you haven't watched him fight I can't blame you, but go watch him fight and then tell me JJ stands a chance. The guy is a legit boxer, 1 body shot from this guy would send most to the canvas, he's got Wilder DNA."
68,He quoted ksi in one of his recent videos
69,I mean you cannot say Pineda is bad when you could see him crumble after the first punches. Dude was obviously hella overwhelmed by the opportunity and JJs power.
70,This guy lost to a journeyman lmao
71,Yeah a very silly suggestion. Just makes you look very silly.
72,Heâ€™s a fucking idiot thatâ€™s what
73,Have you really never seen that joke before?
74,Ignorant people always find a way to put race into a conversation.
75,"This is the KSI subreddit, wat do you expect, most of these ppl have a bedtime"
76,Says the 12 year old white kid who can't recognize an obvious joke
77,"Let me guess; if it was a white person, nobody would complain.

Just because it looks like a mug shot does not make it racially motivated just because heâ€™s black."
78,I dont think you can get more revenue if it sells out...
79,True but heâ€™s undefeated and heâ€™s decently known so thereâ€™s a money opportunity there
80,If ksi calls out tommy fury why canâ€™t he fight marcellos. Imo tommy beats this guy
81,Pineda got knocked out in a steakhouse in Mississauga in his 4th fight against a dude who gave up boxing that same year - did he get overwhelmed at the steakhouse too?
82,who has ksi fought that makes him any better lol
83,Average redditors when someone makes a joke
84,Ummm... exactly what i just said?
85,PPV
86,"You're entitled your opinion bro and I respect that... If you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdusAVl-j74&ab_channel=PBCONFOX) and think think ''Yeah JJ could beat this guy'' then either you are blind or just plain delusional. JJ could probably be a journeyman for Marcellos if he wanted, but this isn't a competetive fight in any way.

You highly underestimate the power that a trained cruiserweight has, especially one who can put together combinations."
87,steak ðŸ¤¤
88,"yes

vaMOSSSS"
89,Logan Paul? I'm pretty sure Logan would annihilate most people on these cards lol.
90,Swarmz
91,I was agreeing?
92,Nah he aint good bro. It would be interesting tho cause ksi aint good based on pro standard.
93,I respect your opinion
94,I don't think Logan Paul is beating a pro boxer
95,Oh shit sorry.
96,Honestly logan could beat some journeyman. Pineda was a pro with 7 fights and way more amateur fights thn all the youtubers combined and yet man was useless.
