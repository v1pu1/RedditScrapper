17,Bro your profile. Itâ€™s not that I wonâ€™t belive it but like thatâ€™s the internet.
18,How could you say that you are selfish and a horrible person I feel sorry for Dixie as her/ his mom died so you should feel sorry too
19,"I feel sorry, I just understand where the first comment is coming from, Wilson, donâ€™t get me wrong, there are many idiots out there to troll with stories like yours and Im sure u can understand it too. My mom havenâ€™t passed away but I can understand when they leave you to move on your own path."
20,Still very selfish and inconsiderate of you thought they were â€˜fakingâ€™ then donâ€™t reply to it at all
21,"Thereâ€™s a possibility, if I miss my oportunity to speak out people might get trapped. 

Itâ€™s far from selfish, posting about a close relatives death is selfish. 

You want sorry and clout from people that u donâ€™t even know."
22,I am pretty sure dixie is lying and this clean throat is their alt which they are using to make u feel guilty
23,"I donâ€™t really care if itâ€™s true Im sorry, if not, well thatâ€™s another brain surgery.

Edit: I did upvoted the post, so Im optimistic about heâ€™s most likely not gonna lie, Im the kind of guy who rather belives it. Letâ€™s just say naive."
