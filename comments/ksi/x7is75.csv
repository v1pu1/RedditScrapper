0,Just because they did a feature with KSI doesn’t mean they’re actual friends
1,"To stay relevant. 
To be real Swarmz just talked shit at the heat of a moment on stream and he caught a boxing match xD You just can't tell me that there was any fucking beef between Swarmz and KSI. It.s was all just shit talk to promote stuff. They did each other a huge favor."
2,Wait what happened to ksi and Rick Ross?
3,"It’s all about fame to these guys. They don’t actually care, they just stir up shit to get their name out there more. Yes both Trippie and Rick are more famous but doesn’t mean they can’t throw some shade out to get a few more clicks and likes."
4,what did rick ross say? 💀
5,Ksi said that him and trippie are cool and that the trippie jake Paul collab is behind them and they made up
6,"still listen to trippie. Not really any new shit, but his past bangers, like Dark Knight Dummo, Taking a Walk, and (999/1400) freestyle. Think what you want, still like his music. But, ksi is probably more famous than both rn."
7,Jealousy
8,W trippie idk what he did
9,Unfair for Swarmz
10, Rick has bigger tiddies than JJ 😳
11,"Swarmz doesn’t count they’re cool. Trippie was a bit of a snake but he did kinda apologize at least. To be honest all of them, like JJ’s ex sparring partners etc have just been snakes in a way when they’ve worked with Jake, I don’t know why but that’s how it is"
12,"Because they aren’t friends, they just worked together once. They don’t need to suck KSI off in every conversation they have."
13,Most of them fallen off so they probably chasing his clout
14,Because he’s doing better than them
15,these 12 year old brits are dont even know shit about trippie and call him a garbage rapper.
16,I’m seeing a lot of dick riding here. Trippie is clear music wise. The majority of KSI’s songs are corny and don’t compare. Rick Ross has been in the game for a long time so KSI has a ways to go before he’s at that level. Swarmz isn’t relevant
17,"Idk who these people are, but I bet there's a combined IQ of 9.3 in this photo."
18,I forgot trippie existed tbh..
19,"They also rarely interacted with JJ , im sure Anne Marie , JME and S-X would never attack JJ"
20,Trippie doesn't have anything against KSI yall bringing old shit back up
21,"Nobody likes to accept the fact that JJ is fucking huge, it’s a pain in the ass when a youtuber sells out fucking stadiums while these garbage ass rappers can’t gather 100 people in their shows 😭🤣 fucking middie redd is also the fakest person to ever be in the industry, he switches up like a light 💀 L rappers"
22,"Don't hate on my man Trippie, he's a talented artist with so many bangers and still is only 23.
Rick ross is a legend in the game, as a person you can judge him but not as a rapper.
Do whatever you want with swarmz tho😂"
23,Trippie will always be a better artist than ksi 😹
24,For clout or to seem cool that's pretty much it.
25,Jake Prob paid Trip and Ross but Swarmz CLOUT
26,"I think rick ross just sided with jake he never gave a shit bout ksi ,swarmz wanted the fight 1st one has beef"
27,Rick Ross doesn’t need ksi to stay relevant. He’s doing that by getting sued for underpaying his minimum wage employees that work for his wing stops that he bought
28,Cause they don’t collaborate Jj probably wasn’t in the studio for either of em
29,who dafuq is the fat fuck in the middle
30,Rick ross liked ksi winning post so I don’t think its that deep
31,Bro really put that shit emoji over Trippie Red 🤣
32,It’s all about the money sir
33,"Rap is all about clout these days. That these guys are willing to make tracks with whoever for a bag and to ride on the next person’s wave, even when they don’t fuck with em shows how shit the genre and it’s “artists” has gotten.

Ross in particular is the biggest fraud in rap. Amazing how he has managed to slither past all of his exposals and still remain a thing."
34,Idk but I’ll still like trippie redd cause of his music
35,Nah the niggas calling trippie and Rick trash because he offended their favourite man ever ksi is borderline insane
36,Because money doesn’t buy loyalty lmao. Just cuz he bought a feature doesn’t mean they friends
37,Why does trippie redd look like trippie redd
38,Getting a feature with something does not make friends with them. It’s all business at the end of the day. Rick Ross doesnt know shit about YT boxing nor does he probably care. He only knows what Jake told him which is that Ksi is ducking him. You can call Trippie and Rick Ross clout chasers but they are more famous than Ksi in the music industry lol. NO HATE JUST BEING UNBIASED
39,"He’s done songs with rice and joe too even though they aren’t rappers it’s similar, but I don’t think swarmz is gonna be salty about it, his recent video seems like he’s taken it well"
40,I wanna suck 50 cents saggy tits
41,they want more views because their numbers aren't looking too good anymore
42,[deleted]
43,Wow
44,"Swarmz stepped up, underprepared and all when Alex tried to sabotage JJ’s event. The “beef” was just to promote the fight."
45,"Is that really a question ?
 
#FAME"
46,"YouTube isn't a platform for making real money when it comes to music but interacting and getting responses, marketing everything creative you want to do with it ,you get it for free ( you don't have to pay YouTube to have a YouTube account). The best example is Wiz Khalifa, he used to promote so much on YouTube and he still does ( a lot more when he just started )  . JJ is a YouTuber , Artist, Rapper , Boxer , Entrepreneur etc etc ( * JJ deserves the clout * ) , he has a fan base he built for years and we do love his content so if you poke an influencer with a massive fan base they get some clout for themselves."
47,idk wtf trippie planned on going at jj
48,(¬‿¬)I would if he produce milk with those jugs
49,What'd Rick Ross say?
50,Money and publicity
51,https://youtu.be/afpA3xt74CA
52,Bags
53,what did trippie and rick do
54,They have fallen off. They are now nothing like they were in there prime. What other reason you think they trying to start beef. KSI doing really well ride know so they all trying to ride on his fame
55,What did Rick Ross say
56,Money he pays them
57,Try to stay relevant
58,Wait a minute Rick Ross calling on JJ too? But when
59,You could also say he was sleeping with his enemies😉
60,What did trippie even say
61,To get that sweet clout from JJ 🤧🤧
62,"Jake spun a narrative to make Rick Ross think he was a pussy. It’s not like he knows all the details, just that “KSI declined the free offer.” Jake is a manipulative twat"
63,"Who the f are the other two
I can only recognise swarms"
64,Trippie redd and Rick Ross needing JJ to stay relevant? Y'all are meat riding the man
65,What Beef dose Rick Ross have?
66,Trying to stay relevant?
67,"They got a taste of relevancy off his coattails and are desperately clinging on to it. 

Except for Trippie. I don’t think he gives a shit and just did that video cause Jakey asked him to"
68,Just for the bag
69,What’s the beef bet Rick Ross & JJ
70,Cuz they friends with Jake Fall minus Swarmz
71,Rick ross was only told what jake wanted him to know so have to give him a pass on that cant give an honest answer to something if your not given the full picture
72,rick ross really shaped like a bowling ball
73,"Strictly buiness but there isnt any real beef i've been, KSI don't do the double dipping I notice."
74,You obviously don't watch every video of KSI or else you'd have known that he and Trippie Redd had a misunderstanding
75,"Trippie ain’t coming for nobody. He’s literally high all the time and doesn’t give a shit. And no way people saying that KSI is better than Trippie and Rick Ross. KSI is good, but nowhere near their level."
76,"Ksi paid them to be on a song, they arent friends (Rick ross and trippie Redd both wipe ksi at rapping)"
77,Trippie and JJ don’t even beef anymore wtf😭💀
78,Clout
79,"Kid just because they have songs together doesn't mean they're friends, some occasions it's turned into friendship (Anne Marie, Yungblud and SX) but these artist were only a feature on a song. Not another contact in jj's friendlist."
80,Idk but fuck ric ross
81,"They're mainstream rappers, they don't have an allegiance to anyone like YouTubers do."
82,Rappers. More like ratters.
83,Rick Ross is a 🐀 no 🧢
84,I mean ksi has access to a huge audience and a lot of clout and money any rapper that has a good team on there hands would get there rapper to get a piece of ksi clout as a good beef would boost both sales and make them more famous
85,Rick Ross has bigger tits than jj's mom!!!!!!
86,Because ksi paid them to be in the songs. Why do you think he has no solo songs and always features? Because ksi can't carry a song.
87,because they are industry losers
88,💰
89,lmao when did rick ross come for im?
90,Shit Ross
91,Ngl down like that was better off with just JJ and sx Rick Ross made it worse but da baby made it terrible
92,"Trippie was known for stirring shit up for the drama, he used to do the same with X back in the day"
93,You can tell Reddit is very very white in these sorts of thread. Rick Ross is a Miami legend
94,You didn't just put a poo in hypertrap's goat
95,Jake Paul must've enticed Rick Ross with some free BBQ wings
96,KSI vs Rick Ross confirmed?
97,trippy redd is a batty boy
98,3 fights 1 night 👀
99,Clout
100,How dare they try to diss KSI. The greatest rapper and boxer alive.
