9,ksi is a jealous clown fr. The woodleypaul2 fight wasnt supposed to happen. jake is still a bigger ppV draw
10,Nobody wanted to watch Paul vs woodley 2 tho
11,Ryanair doing a madness
12,"It‚Äôs true 11a is irrelevant here‚Äôs the link

13,Hopefully not from the plane üëÄ
14,They just had some viral posts on tiktok and now see george ratioing and think thats a good marketing strat. Thisnpost was prob posted by an employee too.
15,nope he also attached a news blog saying jake paul sold more ppv and about being a prick why would anyone just randomly think to post a news blog without any credible source. i dont think there is anything wrong with backing up yourself
16,"IMO no. Jake is not being genuine here, he‚Äôs basically saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry that your PPV sucked, it‚Äôs a very tough industry‚Äù. If Jake performed better than KSI, then at least he could make that case. But KSI says he pulled better numbers.

KSI sees through the BS"
17,Have you read Jake's tweet?
18,"No he's not.

Jake Paul Vs Ben Askren - 370K PPV (the 1M figure was proven to be a lie)
Jake Paul Vs Tyron Woodley - 700K PPV
Jake Paul Vs Tyron Woodley II (Fury) - 67K PPV

Let's look on the other side

KSI Vs Logan Paul - 1M PPV
KSI Vs Logan Paul II - 2M PPV
KSI Vs Swarmz & Pineda - 445K PPV

Jake - 1.1M PPV altogether
KSI - 3.4M PPV altogether

At the end of the day Ksi will always be the bigger ppv draw"
19,üíÄ
20,I mean yeah? kinda but only in the YouTube boxing community.but jj has like 80% of the uk as his fanbase so like
21,was this supposed to be a excuse for why jake paul sold less ppv's??
22,They probably do with how shit there landings are
23,my mistake
24,no I'm just basing it off what is here
25,"ksi has a full influencer card, jake has no name fighters, there are levels, jake is fighting not only better competition but also has better ppV statistics. If jake fought logan, it would also prolly generate 2 mil ppV. Ksi is only fighting against famous people or with famous people in his undercard."
26,What the fuck? JJ has way more fans in different countries. 80% of his fans doesnt only come from the fucking UK dumbass. Watch the sidemen videos?!? He gets swarmed in different countries.
27,Fair enough
28,Well then your comment is incorrect cause your basing it off  something that was taken out of context
29,"average r/ksi user be like

&#x200B;

also I meant jj has 80% percent of the uk population as his fanbase but yeah your points are still valid"
