0,Didnt this happen like a week ago
1,Who the fuck is sneako?
2,Tate Jr seeing the same fate as his daddy
3,Sneako is worse than Tate tbh
4,It’s so weird Sneako blew up I remember watching him make COD commentaries years ago with like 15k subs
5,"Did he break the ToS? I'm genuinely trying to know, not defending"
6,Mfs in here are really bitches when did we think deplatforming was a W. Even if Sneako is a whiny bitch. Stupid cunts u forget Jj and Harry almost got canceled before
7,It is honesty sad how you all hate these guys yet behave exactly like the bots they talk about. Celebrating some random dudes life getting worse how low will you fall just for some attention
8,I don't like where this is going yoy guys are idiots this censorship is crazy never happened before I don5 agree with sneako tate but this censorship is kinda insane and unfair
9,Bro are you using Bing?
10,Nobody cares stop posting this shot here
11,Big w for every one who wants to silence any one we disagree with. I dont like tate nor do i like sneako but i do not like this thing were we just enjoy banning people and clap when some one of oposing view gets banned. Sooner or later ksi views wont be good enough and then he will get banned.
12,Ksi ur fanbase is not looking good. They r no different than lil 15 year old girls
13,sneako is actually so jarring
14,"Jesus fuck, you guys need to look in the mirror and stop hating on people and praying on other people's downfalls. It doesn't matter what other people think and hating other people will only fuel self hate."
15,Yall really celebrating a nigga getting suspended from Twitter? Okay?
16,"can we stick with the fights, funny videos and gaming pls? 2022 is already too much of a fuckfest"
17,"Sneako is a massive clown. Hopefully his YouTube, Facebook and instagram are next"
18,I believe he got band for simulation/threat a youtuber female friend it’s worse than any of old ksi rape faces
19,Why is there so much support for censorship and cancel culture on here? What if JJ had gotten cancelled for things he done in the past?
20,"Idk why we should be happy about someone getting banned for sharing their own opinion. I’m not saying I agree with Tate or Sneako and anyone else who gets banned, but damn are we not allowed to share our own opinions online anymore? I’m not gonna celebrate cancel culture if you don’t like what someone says then just don’t watch their content it should be as simple as that"
21,"Either side you are on, you have to agree that this kind of censorship is scary."
22,am i tweaking or isnt this already old news?
23,Why are you celebrating a person you don't agree on getting cancelled. Even when you don't agree with his viewpoints of the world you can still learn and debate the ideas that are being expressed.i also think Andrew Tate has knowledge strength and integrity the values that you see in your idol Ksi
24,"It’s not a W, you brainless dimwits. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Shows that you can’t say anything of your own opinion. They just cancel and ban everyone that goes against their agenda. Promoting porn stars and OF girls, yeah, that’s good for young kids and children. Promote that"
25,This happened a while ago
26,L
27,Bro is using internet explorer
28,"LOL, no one cares about this literally nobody. Who tf is Sneako?"
29,Oh dear Sneako won’t take that lightly
30,"I was with JJ on the beef, but how the fuck can you call this a W? The guy literally got censored how the fuck can you support that?"
31,“For joking about Andrew Tate” man can social media stop the cap 😂 i love KSI but he’s just not tryna get canceled. It’s sad. Besides saying it’s good he got canceled isn’t really a joke. It’s his opinion and he’s allowed to say it unlike Andrew tate. Fuck social media
32,"Lol
I sense white armor in jj's room"
33,Praying on another mans downfall aint joking
34,Because silencing people is so great.. 😐
35,"Man, I dislike Tate and SEVERELY dislike Sneako, but censorship and silencing other people isn’t exactly a W… even if Twitter is a privately-owned platform."
36,"I don’t understand how yall kids can sit around and be happy about this, just because they got some beef going on. Fact of the matter is people are losing their platform for speaking their mind whilst other people are shaking their asses on ig, twitter etc."
37,L
38,"Im a KSI and SNEAKO fan but this is not a W, idk about tate but people in this sub are hating on sneako rn just because he spoke up against ksi without actually knowing what he’s about"
39,"I didn’t like sneako for the most part but, shutting down someone platform because you disagree will them will not end well."
40,Big L. Yall should stop celebrating when people fail fr.
41,imagine celebrating censorship😭
42,"Beef or not, suspending people you don’t like is NOT the answer. Bring back conversation, debates and freedom of speech."
43,So sad to see. This is what russia and many other countries hide news they dont want to be seen. In north korea they even kill people for unwanted news. I bet there wasnt a reason for the ban.
44,Naa sneako was right
45,L TO FREE SPECH
46,Who tf is sneako? Some tate yes man feeding his ego????
47,Careful you might attract those “freedom of speech” losers
48,Big L
49,big L
50,Man y'all are on these dudes nuts. Give it up already
51,ksi has such a big forehead
52,LETS FUCKING GO. WWWW
53,HUGE W
54,“Joking about Andrew Tate” yeah… a joke
55,Who?
56,Bro I’ve seen this name but who tf is he
57,Who?
58,Shits been gone 🤣. You posted this 6 hours ago and my comment is still relevant 😂
59,Who is he ?
60,Damn sneako really fell off like fr fr?
61,Am I the only one who can't unsee the the time on the guys phone (911)?
62,You know damn well JJ wasn’t joking. Also this isn’t a W it’s just sad to shut people off when they don’t like something lol
63,I still don't know who this mf is
64,"Ig now jj has to tweet ""thankgod"" for real"
65,You’re all botS
66,as it should be 💪💪💪
67,"Hell no, What does it gotta do with his Twitter...
Y'all don't even know sneako ffs"
68,"He reminds me of Kavos, hatin on people just for clout"
69,L tbh
70,the time tho 💀
71,Ayo this is a DUB !!
72,I think y’all take sneako too seriously pretty sure he’s just trolling to keep his numbers up could be wrong tho
73,Sneako got banned for making fun of Islam
74,Finally!!!
75,W
76,Didn’t his girl get fucked in front of him
77,that’s rough
78,I just came to the comments to see some 12 year olds crying and saying that sneako shouldn’t be banned
79,It's not about free speech it's about having bad influence and promoting hatred. Thank God he's gone as well
80,Old news
81,He deserves to be banned more than tate
82,Massive fucking L
83,Not a Big W
84,But why did he get banned
85,"Poor guy , I wonder if Andrew rate will save him ?"
86,Classic KSI W
87,I was sick of him
88,I thought we were above cancel culture guys?
89,W
90,"Make fun of him but don't disrespect the Top G, dork"
91,Yal are disappointing asf. You cant complain about cancel culture one minute then be happy someone you don't like gets silenced. Make up your mind
92,Is Sneako muslim or not? Just curious
93,how tf is this a W ?  i guess 13 yo's don't understand the danger of censorship
94,"This guy is all bark no bite, stop posting that shit here"
95,"Not really a w, neither was tates ban. Some of the things they say aren’t likable and are bad, but banning them isn’t a good thing, cus it brings more attention to them"
96,Big W's
97,Hope he gets banned on yt too bro. I agree with his statements for women and all but ksi thing it all comes too much
98,Ksi fans being split like this against cancel culture is insane to me. If this shit keeps going it will come for harry and jj eventually.
99,More suspension of speech
100,"Sneako is way worse than Tate, like if you haven’t seen his content it’s like a more hateful Tate times a thousand"
