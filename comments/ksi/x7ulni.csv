0,I‚Äôm getting ptsd from ksi v Logan 1 where that was meant to be deji and jj‚Äôs goal for that card
1,"It would be sick but considering what Logan recently said about Andrew Tate on Impaulsive, I doubt he would associate himself with an event that gives Andrew Tate a platform, even though he wouldn‚Äôt be the one fighting him. Just an assumption though"
2,Just stop giving him a platform. Let the cunt fade away into irrelevance
3,"So basically JJ should fight a semi professional, retired, 35 year old  kickboxer in a boxing match?"
4,"no. jj should be done fighting big influencer names regardless of talent. even if it means fighting skilled no-name fighters, he should look for talent over name to truly show off his skill"
5,"Logan has already mentioned why giving these 2 cunts a platform or a way to project their ideals even more is a brutal mistake. JJ hopefully keeps his ego aside and just ignores Andrew and that will be it. He wants to fight him, badly but maybe he'll see reason. That he really shouldn't. Logan already doesn't want anything to do with both of them. As should all of us. It's like he said. The things Andrew says and how they will affect impressionable young kids who get swayed by him since they don't know any better. That effect will be disastrous and that's putting it lightly.



Sneako already hates JJ and has been swayed by these 2 brothers. But at least he's not as crazy as the Tates. At least not yet."
6,That will be amazing. The biggest YouTube boxing fights of all time.
7,Fuck giving that fuck face a platform. Let him become irrelevant
8,"Why everyone talks like ksi wins 100% against Tate?
So what if Andrew wins, this will Boost his ego more + it will give him a platform and you'll make that shit worse"
9,"What happened to when this sub was about memes, people just begging him to validate their ideas now"
10,What if everyone just forgets about them instead of giving them a platform.
11,"fucking hell... watching people write virgin ass essays about wanting their favorite youtubers to fight other people that they disagree with is just sad man, ive been a fan of jj since 2016 these new ksi fans are such dumbasses jesus üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
12,"No. Fuck the tates.

They‚Äôre gonna be irrelevant soon hopefully, don‚Äôt need to give them a platform for no reason."
13,"Shit fight, idt Logan would be down"
14,JJ seems like such a good guy but he honestly one of the worst fanbases ever.
15,TRISTAN TATE never had a problem with JJ he actually shouted him out last month on tate confidential stream in regards to his reaction on sidemen reacts. Andrew Tate never had an issue with JJ until he started chatting shit after the fact hes been deplatformed.
16,Ngl tate brothers would win that
17,No
18,"Why are you pretending you u
Just came up with this"
19,"Hell nah, he will be irrelevant when january rolls around mate"
20,No no stop giving Andrew Tate a talking platform
21,"Logan had explained it , "" he'll be irrelevant 2-3 months later "" why giving him a big stage üòµ"
22,Stop giving that bitch attention
23,jj and logan both need people who can actually box
24,Nah bro Tristan tate is sound. It‚Äôs just Andrew who‚Äôs a cunt
25,Who the fuck is Tristen? There's 2 of these cunts?
26,Logan already said he doesn‚Äôt wanna platform Tate though
27,"Ok look , I'm all for jj winning and everything , but pls UNDERSTAND that ANDREW TATE is a professional , who has almost been undefeated . Stop giving him a platform for all his bs , and let everyone simply forget about that cunt."
28,"No, shut up, let these losers die in obscurity"
29,I think its better to give none of them a Plattform‚Ä¶logan was literally the enemy of the internet yet his fight against ksi saved his legacy ‚Ä¶.
30,What about ksi and his brother deji vs landrew and tristan
31,I hope they both knock the t\*te dumbasses out so hard simultaneously and wipe their disgusting deformed thumb faces off the internet. They're a plague
32,"Didn‚Äôt JJ say he didn‚Äôt want to fight Tate,also Tristan would fuck Logan up I think and Andrew would beat Jj sorry"
33,So let‚Äôs kill Tate
34,Tristan tate would pussy out
35,"The tates have to much experience in the fight game I can‚Äôt see them beating the tates . 
Would be a good event thought . 

I‚Äôve done kick boxing for over 10 years and could easily dismantle ksi unfortunately imo when you‚Äôve been a champion it trumps everything else"
36,"Let me be honest 
Ksi loses to Andrew and Logan probably beats Tristan lol"
37,Mate with all due respect you are delusional if you think JJ and Logan Paul can beat either one of them the Tate's  are real fighters they have been longer then we know JJ or Logan Paul trust me those fight won't happen anyway
38,They should take those pussies to wwe for a 2v2
39,No way Logan would agree to fight Tristan
40,He already has plans. He just wont spoil the suprise
41,"No at the rate jj trash talks he‚Äôs gotta fight tommy fury
Someone with actual boxing experience 
His next fight should be less about the stupid beefs and more about proving his skill to make that jake fight look more competitive than it does rn cus from what we‚Äôve seen jj would get smoked by jake"
42,That‚Äôs what I said
43,Honestly platform or not I just want to see the man get fucked up by JJ . Career ending KO
44,That would be lit
45,This is pretty much people saying ‚Äújake paul Andrew tate Logan tristan‚Äù but Ksi.
46,people have been saying this for ages jesus catch up init
47,JJ n Logan both lose
48,Imagine a wwe tag team match .
49,correct me if I am wrong but isnt Tristan injured for life?
50," I‚Äôd love to see it, however the effect of Andrew and Tristan, especially Andrew, if they win would make them very popular, especially among some people, and while I do agree if Logan and JJ were to both knock the brothers out it would be a huge W, I think it‚Äôs quite risky to give them a platform as huge as that."
51,JJ is gonna destroy Andrew Tate if the fight happens. Tate is only known for MMA or Kickboxing. He's actually really shit at boxing.
52,"Tristan taint says he‚Äôs 6‚Äô4, so would be a good match for logan"
53,"Dk if tates would actually be a tough boxer
But damn thats a hype card tbf"
54,Tristan Tate retired from fighting due to injury so definitely won‚Äôt happen
55,Very good idea but unsure of the outcome
56,Tristan won't be able to box because he has had a shoulder surgery due to some injury and now can't box or even kick box for that matter.
57,No. Again giving these sexist pieces of shit a platform is a horrible idea. Please stop
58,"But they would just be giving them a platform. I think we can all agree the Tate brothers are on their way out, JJ even teasing fighting him is just dragging him back into the limelight and getting him relevant and on our screens again, which is something no one needs"
59,Andrew possibly winning would do too much damage. Giving him a platform and potentially getting a win would not be a good look
60,neither one of them wants to give them attention or entertain them i‚Äôd even argued if the tate bros win they‚Äôll eventually fade out
61,"you're right mate , if that happens it would be FUCKING SICK ya know what im sayin lad"
62,Smh why are we still giving Tate a platform here‚Ä¶
63,Logan won't do it he has said he dosnt want to give then a platform still really want to see Andrew vs ksi tho
64,I don‚Äôt really care about JJ fighting Andrew or Logan fighting Tristan how about we let them fade into irrelevance
65,"If so then JJ becomes the biggest hypocrite known to mankind. As much as Tate is a scam artist, he hasn‚Äôt had a proper fight for about a decade let alone a boxing match - all aspects in which JJ bullies Jake Paul for fighting opponents like this."
66,"Don‚Äôt give him the platform, JJ‚Äôs point about making him look not as tough in front of his ‚Äútop g‚Äôs‚Äù is irrelevant if he doesn‚Äôt get a platform"
67,they ain‚Äôt beating 2 world champions bro
68,"Tristan Tate wasn't even a decent kickboxer, It would be ridiculous for them to fight and I'm absolutely certain Tristan Tate would not last a round against Logan Paul (If you watched kickboxing you'd agree with what I'm talking about)"
69,If it goes to kickboxing both logan and ksi are fucked.
70,Logan beats Tristan badly
71,Sorry tate brothers beat them both up :p
72,"Ngl, I didnt know he had a brother, I thought it was andrew tate but with hair then shaved it or smthn"
73,"Not gonna lie, I really want to see Logan fight Doctor Mike on The January Misfits Boxing Event instead of battling Dillion Danis. I think that that would be a sick fight and the predictions for it would be pretty mixed. This would be a very close fight."
74,"This would break the ""matrix"" lol"
75,Mfs turning into Captain America and Black Thor ong
76,No
77, mach should be call : fall of the tates
78,"no. currently, the shit brothers are shut down all over social media. why would Jj give them the opportunity to resurrect their career? He's done it with Logan, with the whole japan incident. and even if JJ wins, its still a win for the tates. idk, it just doesnt seem like the right move rn"
79,Paul vs Tate would make more sense + better storyline
80,Facts
81,I don‚Äôt want to see my 2 favourite YouTubers get smoked lmfaooooo
82,Stfu we don't want tate in a boxing ring. I hope this stupid sub just bans talks about this guy
83,Holy shit this is cringe
84,im the reall jj
85,Fuck Andrew state move on from him.
86,I love JJ but would honestly sell better if it was the Paul Brothers vs the Tate brothers
87,Tristan Tate is also taller than Andrew I think so kinda makes sense. Dillon Danis would be a far better fighter though
88,Great event imo
89,"JJ should never associate with Andrew Tate. Even if JJ wins a boxing match against him, he is still giving Tate a platform to spread hate and misogyny to young impressionable viewers."
90,It‚Äôs giving them a platform. So no.
91,"JJ actually had a point in beating Andrew so his fanboys don't view him as this ""Top G"" anymore. IF he can beat him that is."
92,"If JJ dropped a fight with that white supremacist because he doesn‚Äôt want to platform someone with that type of message, I don‚Äôt see why the same doesn‚Äôt apply to Tate?"
93,I said this exact thing on a former post and I got downvoted into oblivion. Glad to see a fellow mate agree and not get downvoted.
94,FINALLY! FUCKING THANK YOU
95,You can't stop the top g
96,Why not? Is he doing anything thats not allowed or illegal?
97,I just don‚Äôt see that happening anytime soon he was removed off all the major social media platforms and yet is still constantly talked about. I feel like I see him more now that he‚Äôs banned it‚Äôs weird. But he still has a massive cult following of losers so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs just going to fade away into irrelevance. Especially when JJ is still making videos on him‚Ä¶
98,Lol you a bitch

100,"Honestly that's hypocritical of Logan, you'd think that as someone who experienced being cancelled and grew as a person from that experience he'd be more open to give people a chance."
