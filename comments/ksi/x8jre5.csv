1,They both have ricegum desperation in the their eyes to stay relevant.
2,Have yall heard the goofy classroom tales of tate kid fans
3,I’m 20 and Andrew tate genuinely helped me out of my depression and bad mindset (not just him but he was one of the positive influences that helped). Try again
4,good for you mate
5,Bro he literally said depression isnt real
6,That was a hyperbole. He said that in one clip but he’s got more where he talks about it. And he has a point. You can only be depressed if you allow yourself to be depressed and that’s what I realised I was doing. If I sit and cry about my problems all day I will be more depressed but if I go on like I have no problems and depression doesn’t exist then it literally gets better.
7,"Thats not for everyone tho, its a mental illness. Some people have money, good body , good habits ,everything but they are still depressed. Its not easy for everyone"
8,"It’s not a mental “illness”, that’s the point. It’s a mental imbalance"
9,"No thats not I meant. Some people are depressed due to mental illnesses, I myself am a example."
10,"I get what you mean bro. I sincerely hope you get better soon from one brother to another. I suffered for a long time and I just wanna see other people be healthy as well now. That being said one of my big issues is the fact that people see depression/anxiety as an “illness”. A mental illness is something like dementia, schizophrenia etc. Depression and anxiety are simply natural human emotions that we evolved to have, and under a normal mental balance those emotions help us make better decisions on a day to day basis. When we develop an imbalance of those emotions we enter a negative cycle causes us to develop more problems then we had in the beginning basically creating an endless hopeless loop until you break the cycle. Meds don’t help. It’s like putting a bandage on a broken arm. You have to fight the root cause and only you can save yourself. Good luck"
11,Tysm bro
