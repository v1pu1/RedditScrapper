0,I mean the goal of charity match is to get a huge audience. And will will bring a whole different audience. Bad content bad more exposure meaning more successful event so yeah for charity
1,"Assuming this is a Tommy replacement as a) he has that minecraft fandom clout  and 
b) he is good friends with Mr Beast so was probably travelling anyway?"
2,Heâ€™s hella cringe but its a charity match so whatever
3,"People hate him but i just hate his fanbase,theyâ€™re cringey asf"
4,Its a match for charity idk why people are complaining
5,So be it. I think twitter is overreacting as always. They really didnâ€™t like it.
6,Seems like a good guy even if he is cringe.
7,"People is such an ass. It's a charity football match, it's literally for kind people like him. It's not a boxing match which needs 6 month camp. he can play football like everyone, I'm sure he will be better than many.
This fucking people all they want is everything to be extra grand like who they want to add? Andrew Tate and Jake Paul.."
8,"It's a charity match. As long as it earns a lot of money for a good cause, then who cares"
9,I dont care but if he calls football soccer he's out
10,Dude is annoying asf
11,Lmao whoðŸ˜‚
12,"itâ€™s a charity match and he has a TON of fans. stop crying. people getting way to entitled, just understand you complaining on twitter or reddit wonâ€™t do SHIT"
13,"Harry would ""accidentally"" slide tackle him."
14,Itâ€™s a charity match lol why so pressed about it ðŸ˜‚
15,"L, get Boris instead"
16,Mr beast confirmed
17,Buddy is gonna get snapped by vikstar
18,I dont like him that much but hes ok
19,I think it's cool that he's willing to fly out for it!
20,Heâ€™s gotten a lot better from when he first joined MrBeast
21,"Really donâ€™t like him. Donâ€™t like any of them tbh. Jimmy seems nice and what heâ€™s done is incredible, but personality wise theyâ€™re all boring and dull af. Theyâ€™re far too vanilla and unfunny. That said I ainâ€™t complaining Karlâ€™s playing, he has his fanbase and itâ€™s for charity."
22,Can he even play football?
23,I donâ€™t know who it is so Iâ€™m indifferent
24,I hope he gets slide tackled
25,Heâ€™s annoying asf but its a charity match jus let it slide rlly
26,he's cringe but it is what it is
27,Bro for real I hate Karl this boy is cringe and not funny and do things gets in my nerve sometimes but it's for charity so whatever
28,Heâ€™s cringe asf tbh.
29,"Donâ€™t know much about him other than heâ€™s in Mr Beastâ€™s crew, so itâ€™s whatever I guess"
30,i dont really care its for charity and its gonna pull more money in for the charity so there is no need to complain
31,If cringe was a person it would be him
32,Hes just annoying so yeah idk
33,Annoying
34,I like Karl seems like a good bloke ain't got a problem
35,Canâ€™t stand him.
36,As long as I dont hear his laugh it's fine
37,"Heâ€™s better than Tommyinnit,

Heâ€™s going to bring a strong audience to the charity match, coming from the Minecraft side and Mr Beastâ€™s community."
38,"Nah man why, he has no connection to the Sidemen whatsoever, and the fans dont know him. Its pointless, they should have played someone we know and love in the scene instead."
39,Cool. He is funny and there's not harm with him and his fan supporting the charity.
40,Honestly I donâ€™t want his estrogen ass in a football match that shit ainâ€™t for pussies
41,Please no he is so annoying
42,He couldnt run for 10 minutes without being tired lets be honest
43,One of the most annoying youtubers out there
44,Hes already annoying asf on mrbeast and annoying everywhere else lets just hope hes not here.
45,Odd and unexpected choice but he's a cool guy I like. 2nd most popular of the Mr Beast crew after Jimmy
46,This is a big L
47,"So long as heâ€™s eating better now, Iâ€™m good with it."
48,L
49,Heâ€™s underrated tbh.. he used to annoy tf out of me but heâ€™s grown on me lol
50,Hes really annoying but I don't really care
51,"Hell yeah we like it,"
52,"He's just annoying, nothing else. He's boring aswell. Can't stand him tbh"
53,Dude is hella annoying
54,Hope he gets two footed
55,"Heâ€™s just cringe thatâ€™s all, nothing personal. It is what it is the others make up for it"
56,Don't really watch him. He's probably gonna get tackled in the most barbaric way possible by harry so it's fine by me
57,Not a chance
58,Cringe as fuck
59,Waste of a spot
60,"The people calling him annoying probably have only seen like one clip of him on twitter and are now basing all of their judgement onto him. I dont watch him but hes def not that annoying. His fans tho, Mincraft stans are very bad"
61,"They are getting a wider variety of people too attract more viewers and get more donations. At the end of the day, this is still a charity match so getting more donations is better than only letting their friend group play"
62,I lowkey want quadeca to play as well
63,Heâ€™s a melt but will probably bring in more donations
64,Like apart from being cringe doesnâ€™t bring anything to the table
65,Hell no
66,No
67,Excuse why do people hate him? I don't really mind him
68,"This is a charity match! Dude has got a lot of fans, and Mr. Beast will probably donate because he's on it. The more money they can bring the better, doesn't really matter who's playing.

I think he's a bit cringe and has some dumb jokes but other then that he's decent."
69,Kick him in tommyinnits replacement
70,Massive L
71,"Since speed will likely be there I doubt he'll do anything that garners more attention than that guy, don't particularly like Carl but eh whatever it's a charity match"
72,Who??
73,"Harry needed a Minecraft person to slide tackle and Tommy dropped out so they needed a replacement...

No, but I don't care. He's pulling in viewers from all kinds of places just by existing there, so even if he does nothing it's still huge for the event and the charity. It's not about whether or not the Charity Match is cringe, it's about pulling in as many viewers and donating as much to the charity as possible, and inviting someone outside of our scope of things to broaden the audience will help with that."
74,why did karl become a thing in mrbeast I actually cant watch a mrbeast video without cringing at him
75,He may he cringe and unlikeable but he has a big following and its a charity match so that means more money to charity and that's a great thing
76,Why do people have a strong opinion about itâ€¦ ok he might be abit cringe but thatâ€™s what makes him liked by me beast fans so thatâ€™s that.
77,No
78,hell nah
79,"It's a charity event, whether you like him or not it's for a good cause and I respect it"
80,No. Not only is he American so he would never have played football but he's a Minecraft YouTuber/part of the Minecraft YouTuber community)ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
81,Stupid
82,its an L i'd rather have swarmz
83,No ðŸ‘Ž
84,Guess they couldnâ€™t afford mr beast
85,Why do people hate him?
86,Maybe post it on de sdmn reddit
87,Fat L
88,L
89,"Dream SMP, Twitter stans, him being in the game will bring more online viewers, so it's an understandable pick"
90,"Meh, i dont have anything against him"
91,"He really shouldnt be there,but he kinda adds more clout to the lineup"
92,"Bruh, we made it but Americans use it the most. no hate"
93,"Who tf cares mate it's for Charity and it's football.... not a tinder... not a Among us... they are literally just running chasing a plastic ball for fun and to make money to a charity

CALM YOUR FKN TITS...."
94,Its alright. I personally think the purpose of the match is a bigger deal than who is in it.
95,Quite disappointing and even worse than when they announced Cal the dragon was playing tf even chandler or Chris or Jimmy himself would be better
96,Don't care. But don't like him. Annoying and loud. We won't hear his Annoying little voice and personality in it so don't care. He seems a really sweet guy though so idk how I feel about him. Sweet and nice. But comedy isn't his speciality
97,"I don't particularly hate him, it's his fans I hate"
98,[deleted]
99,Would've prefered Chandler or Chris but wtv
100,Who the fack cares. This community has nothing been other then complaining. Ffs man
