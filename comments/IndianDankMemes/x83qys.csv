Kya chutiye log bhare padhe hai is sub par. Maaf karde bhai/behen

“HoW daRe yOu tO AssUme mY gender”"
69,Lawde se woke.
70,Yup totally Let’s generalise an entire gender then use it to demean one guy on Reddit and if he makes a counter call it a joke. Bhai learn to take responsibility of what you say. Just because you are behind a name like bhavneet doesn’t mean you can say whatever and then call it a joke. And calling someone chutiya isn’t a valid arguement. Tereko kese pata kaun chutiya hai? Bhai gali har koi de sakta hai par sirf ek type ke log dete hain.
71,Ayo bengali spotted
72,"Toh bhai, tu guy nai hai?"
