1,I’ll tell you a better situation. I had PCM till 12th. Shifted to Economics Honours in graduation. Also did masters in economics. Also learned python (only for Data science not development). Got 12 LPA as starting salary. Left the job in 1 year to do derivatives trading full time. Made net losses in first 8-9 months. Recovered my losses in next 3 months. Now I’m earning more in a month than my job payed me and I only work 4-5 hours a day.
2,Bcom ka naam suna he
3,Diploma has left the chat
4,"I'm seeking consistency, I'm just gonna join the military after graduation, you can say I'm selfish, I just need to use the goverment to selfishly die with pride..."
5,Humko bhi sikhao 10 ka 10000 karna
6,Wów
7,kitna capital chayiye trading karne ke liye
8,2022 mea log commerce bhi le rahe hea 10th ke baad?
9,"Diploma toh avoid karne ka bhai.
Sirf diploma karke koi job deta nahi aur diploma karke engineering me jaldi addmission milta nahi. Usme bhi agar Maharashtra ke bahar hai toh entrance exam alag se likhna padta..."
10,Nothing selfish about it brother. You do you. It’s much better you know what you want to do at such a young age.
11,Itne high returns ke liye toh daaka daalna padega bhai
12,"No one will tell you this and if someone disagrees with me here has either not done trading or is lying about it. So you can start trading with as less than as 10k. But if you’re serious about it you’ll probably start with 50k or more. The thing is whatever amount you start with you’ll lose 50%-100% of it in the learning process. If your heart, mind and pocket can survive that you’ll start fresh with the same amount or more. Now if you haven’t learned anything it’ll repeat again. The day you figure everything out is the day you’ll start making money. In my personal opinion 1.2L is the amount through which you can make 25-30k per month if you know what you’re doing. This is at least what my trading setup allows me to make consistently. You can scale it up yourself."
13,Log jitne science lete he utne commerce bhi lete hei Bhai
14,Chal jo tu karta wahi sikha de.. 2 roti toh naseeb hogi roz khud ke paise ki
15,"Mere school mea to shayad 15 baache the commerce mea...

Edit: normie ho kya, normie ke symptoms dikh rahe hea"
