1,"I'd like someone to do a documentary series in the style of *Up!*, where they get a bunch of fruitcakes who believe things like this and check in with them every few years.

Name it *So, Still No Jesus?*, which is the first question that gets asked at the start of each sequence."
2,"If that is a public school, I‚Äôd raise hell. If that said ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù instead of Jesus, the thumpers would be apoplectic."
3,"If it's a public school, I'd be calling the Freedom From Religion Foundation."
4,"Oh no, sin is legal? Like I‚Äôm allowed to be a Buddhist or something? Damn that should be illegal."
5,‚ÄúJesus is coming!‚Äù Screams cult member for last 2000 years
6,"The first thing I saw was ""we stop at rr crossings"" and I honestly think the fact that they think that needs to be advertised is funnier than the fruitcake stickers"
7,Jesus cums a lot.
8,"""I created you!!! How dare you not choose me!!"" 

- Jesus I guess

Is it me, or does that sound a little.. abusive.. Like I guess they never claimed he was the god of free will, but still. How's it love of we're compelled to chose in order to avoid eternal anguish? Pass üòí"
9,Jesus mad?
10,Jesus is mad y'all hating each other and shooting up schools instead of feeding the poor & hungry and providing medical care for all.
11,Contact the FFRF and/or ACLU.
12,A huffing and puffing mad Jesus.   And he's got a gun??!  Jesus no they are just kids.
13,Having this on a school bus is fucked.
14,Jesus: üò°
15,I bet he is what with all the merchants in the churches.
16,"Ah Tennessee, it makes sense."
17,Tennessee. Checks out.
18,"What's he going to do, forgive me?

He's already died for my sins once.

Christians make no fucking sense."
19,Black spray paint. Nuff said
20,"Isn't jesus the one person that doesn't get mad?

Like, Judas fucking betrayed him for silver and man's still forgave him when he was crucified."
21,The sign above it concerns me more. Is this a big problem in America that it needs to be advertised? In europe everyone stops at level crossings.
22,>SOON‚Ñ¢
23,"We don't have school bus drivers here, but if we did; this would absolutely be illegal."
24,Probably mad due to all of the killings and rapings done in his name tbh. He was all about the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan‚Äù story
25,So they haven‚Äôt heard of all the child abuse in the church I take it.
26,"Let‚Äôs see, according to Scripture none but the Father knows when the Son of Man will return, and God‚Äôs ways are not Man‚Äôs ways.  Therefore, according to their own belief system, it is impossible for them to know that Jesus is returning soon and that He is angry.  Also, sin is knowingly transgressing against God‚Äôs will, we are called to have a personal relationship with Christ, and that we are not to judge others.  It amazes me that the most outspoken ‚ÄòChristians‚Äô seem to know so little about the religion they claim to follow."
27,"He‚Äôs not coming back, as he doesn‚Äôt exist,"
28,"Most school buses in my area are privately owned so I'm guessing, if it is, it won't count as anything being wrong."
29,Why would Jesus come back.  Look at how he was treated last time he turned up
30,God gives no fucks.
31,I can‚Äôt wait for Jesus to hand my ass to me lmao
32,"Here's the thing, if Jesus is coming and he's mad at the sinners, if you're not a sinner you've nothing to worry about. Sit back and enjoy the smiting."
33,He‚Äôs always ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
34,"I thought he was supposed to wander back within a generation, he ain‚Äôt coming"
35,"Wait.  Their God doesn't make sin illegal?  What are they, Satanists?"
36,What the flying fuck is that ‚Ä¶.?
37,"Any day now, people have only been saying it for nearly 2000 years"
38,Why are they advertising that Jebus is nearing the end of an angry edging session??
39,Then let Jesus come tell me himself.
40,"Yes. The govt makes free speech and freedom of religion legal. Both sins that break 2 of the 10 commandments. And we wouldn't want it any other way. If that makes Jesus mad, then he needs to settle down and get over himself."
41,The God Bless America thing is so weird to me. Like does God not bless anywhere else???  Such an self fellating phrase.
42,Jesus is rapidly approaching your location with a nail bat
43,I'd HOPE the school bus stops as railroad crossings!
44,Stopping at railroad crossings?! Amateurs! Speed up!
45,Oh no Santa!
46,"The one thing Jesus got violently angry about is dodgy money stuff happening in churches so yeah, if Jesus appears he's going to be angry, probably at the church which produced that sticker."
47,"Reminds me of when my Jr high bus driver would blast ""You Raise Me Up"" on repeat the whole ride."
48,https://youtu.be/qZQGEfcKDsw?t=2m53s
49,They can put shit like that on school buses? Hell would happen if someone did that in my country.
50,"Turn the other cheek, love thy neighbor jesus?

Do they even read the bible?"
51,"I would trade my soul just for ringside seats to watch Jesus actually come back and judge these ""Christians""."
52,Another good use for leaded paint.
53,"Yes, Magic School Bus, he is mad! But‚Ä¶ not for the reason you‚Äôre thinking of.

Plot twist: Jesus is a feminist!!!"
54,So‚Ä¶when exactly is Jesus coming? They‚Äôve been saying this for a very long time
55,"Yes, mad at the Christian zealot taliban abusing his and his dad's names."
56,Cool cool‚Ä¶ let me know when he‚Äôs here I got a few questions for mr thorn hair.
57,"Ah yes, a loving God"
58,"Oh my God I can‚Äôt wait till the rapture.  Imagine a world without Christians, Fucking Paradise"
59,Jesus isn‚Äôt coming as he was a mortal with high charisma and hasn‚Äôt had wish cast on him yet
60,"Unrelated but the ‚ÄúWe Stop at Railroad crossings‚Äù sticker‚Ä¶

Is that special? That‚Äôs how railroad crossings work, surely?"
61,"""The government makes (X) legal.)

Well yeah.  Thsts how the law works.  Your elected leaders propose laws that are either voted in to effect or discarded.  Actually much like religion.  People will read some religious text and choose which parts they want to follow and which to ignore with the bonus of being able to add in stuff that was never before heard of.  There is a lot if that last one going on recently."
62,"Yeah he's mad, mad at you fuck faces for being hateful lil shits. He'd come down here and smite all y'all asses if he were real and side with the people your dumb asses are oppressing! Whatever happened to their teaching about unconditional love n stuff? 

Jfc xD"
63,"If Jesus is so mad, why's he still not here yet? What, is he stuck in traffic?!"
64,I‚Äôm no theologist but wasnt that Jesus fella big into forgiveness and shit? Why is he suddenly mad?
65,Of course he's mad... because of all the lies told about him and all the atrocities commited in his name... christians beware!
66,"Find a sharpie and find some way to turn that last sentence into ""and boy is he *hard*"""
67,"I thought god encouraged his children to turn the other cheek. Why would he not do the same, and forgive?"
68,"I'm sure he would be super pissed at the likes Kenneth Copeland Creflo Dollar and Kat Kerr who claims she actually goes to heaven to have tea with God. 

I wonder what Jesus would actually say about the prospect of mega churches and a 10% mandatory cut of gross yearly pay! That before taxes!"
69,"Exactly! Jesus is going good you down while Mary castrates you.

Oh no, sorry. He's the Redeemer. He's the good one. He'll send you to hell for wearing mixed fabrics."
70,"If you ignore these morons, will they go away?"
71,Jesus is cumming ü§®
72,Way to make him sound like an evil dark lord.
73,"""Jesus is going to get you for me because I'm mad about how shitty my life turned out!"""
74,He's right though. The JC I was taught about would be mad as a trumper on january 7th. Thankfully the religious leaders of america would be the ones catching the brunt of his anger (if he had been real)
75,Does RR stand for Racist Republicans?
76,"We could have a ""Jesus Watch"" on SNL.  Like they used to have with the pope.  ""Breaking news on Weekend Update: the pope is not dead."""
77,I'm sinning as best I can so he didn't die for nothing.
78,"Well, we‚Äôve been waiting hundreds of years I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs coming eventually‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..right?"
79,if Jesus is coming that means i can shoot him
80,Isnt his whole thing NOT being mad and instead forgiving transgressions?
81,He‚Äôs probably mad about how fat you all are.
82,The name completely sells it
83,Hasn‚Äôt this person heard? Trump is the Messiah and he‚Äôs here *now*.
84,The Russ Meyer film?
85,"I love it, longest running series in history when you think about it."
86,Seems like something the Daily Show and Jordan Kepler would do while checking in on the Maga folks.
87,I would do a lot more If it didnt risk my job and family relationships
88,"Almost certainly put on by some random person, not the school.  Still it should be removed by the school."
89,"It‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúapocalyptic‚Äù üôÑ  
  
 
(/s because the last time I posted an obviously sarcastic ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù I got downvoted to hell)"
90,"Psst, Allah means god, just in another language. Also Jesus isn't god, he's the son of god."
91,"already contacted, not too hopeful but maybe something will get done"
92,"Based on the reg plate, it looks like the bus is from Tennessee... so good luck with that."
93,"Wait, we're allowed to wear mixed fabrics now?"
94,And don't forget. He's pissed!
95,"Hey man some of us aren't good with time frames. Heck even Jesus got it wrong.

""Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.‚Äú (Matthew 16:28)"
