1,Maybe Gods plan for many is abortion. Now who‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô up sky daddy‚Äôs plans?
2,"And for some of those kids that plan apparently includes dying from cancer before they even really get to live, or a childhood filled with abuse. I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt care about the plans of this fictional monster‚Ä¶"
3,"In 10 out of 100 pregnancies, God's plan for the child is to have them spontaneously miscarry before 12 weeks have passed. Kind of a lazy plan if you ask me."
4,It's just sad really that these people have any power. This shit is insane
5,"God gave directions for abortion in The Bible.

Maybe the abortion was His plan."
6,If that's true gods a dick.
7,You can extrapolate this logic to God wanted or made that man rape that young girl.
8,"Exodus 11:5 
*Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who rules the land, to the firstborn children of female slaves who use their handmills, including every firstborn domestic animal*

Genius 22:2 
*Then God said, ""Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.""*

Psalm 137:9
*Happy is the one who seizes your infants
and dashes them against the rocks*

The bible isn't ""pro life"""
9,If a woman gets an abortion isn't that God's plan all along?
10,"Maybe we can tax the churches, and use the money to support orphanages, and abused women."
11,I can foil God's plan. I am more powerful than God. QED
12,"God can fuck off. I mean if he wants it so much, get an abortion and he can have that baby in heaven where he can show it ‚Äúunconditional‚Äù love."
13,Gods prepared for what? To give a shitty life to someone? These people don't think for shit.
14,"Flash to the kid who gets bullied so badly he kills himself.. Yeah.. God had a plan for him, right? I fucking hate their ignorance."
15,"This is how fundamentalism looks, don't fool yourselves. The current debate in the US it's not like in the rest of the West, you are facing real anti-democratic extremists."
16,So you're telling me that a mere mortal can just straight up disrupt the almighty creator's plans by having an abortion?
17,"Maybe God's plan is for you to shut the fuck up, Abby."
18,"""God planned your ten-year-old daughter getting raped and impregnated.""

*hooray*"
19,"This has got to be the worst argument I ever hear against abortion, and it always gets under my skin. ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt like it‚Äù. God isn‚Äôt real, what else ya got?"
20,"Fuck you, Abby"
21,God is a terrible father.
22,"Hmmmm ... one would think a deity that supposedly knows all events past, present, and future AND created an entire universe could've come up with a way to prevent abortions if they bothered him so much ..."
23,"""God's plan for this child is to die midway through developing and poison your body for 3 months, who are you to oppose that"""
24,If god is so pro life why does he like war and famine so much?
25,"God takes little kids lives all the time, he don't give a fuck"
26,"""I have a plan for you: you'll get leukemia at 5, and your parents are too poor for healthcare""

""I have a plan for you: you'll be an orphan, because your mother will die of heroin overdose and your father was her dealer""

""I have a plan for you: your father will be a violent alcoholic who beats your mother while you cry in your bedroom""

""I have a plan for you: your mother will hate you from day one, because she resent your father who raped her, and will make you pay for that""

""I have a plan for you: you'll be forced into child labor""

""Oh my Me, this is exhausting, but I'm so proud to have a plan set for every child, I'll keep working on that..."""
27,"Yeah exactly. Dont mess with gods plan. He was gonna give that baby a new type of cancer. Or have him be born as gay and grow up in an unloved home where he will guide him to questioning his faith, ultimately leading him to go hell for being born gay."
28,My sister wasn‚Äôt prepared. My nephew killed himself when he was 21 years old because he was suffering from depression. Probably because of his childhood which was not good. He was also a Christian. Where was god then you stupid fucking bitch?
29,Prove it abbey.
30,*But God always pays child support if your faith is pure enough* would be the answer they'd might give sadly...
31,God doesn't pay bills. That's why churches ask for tithes.
32,"Ok, Honey. 

Except for the FACT, - that god does not exist."
33,"""God's plan was for you to be raped and to carry a child with genetic abnormalities to term!"""
34,It's God's plan for me to get an abortion
35,"You know what‚Äôs great about being a religious leader? You can just make up whatever you want and say it‚Äôs what God wants, and people believe you!"
36,Must be a pretty weak god if his plans can be fucked up by 1 medical procedure.
37,I like the argument that aborted babies go straight to heaven. That sounds like the perfect existence! Literally no possibility due to others actions than ending up in heaven. Every baby should be aborted if it means a certain entrance to heaven! That's the best possible outcome you could hope for
38,"*Me at the abortion clinic singing god's plan*

Sorry kiddo. Seems to be what God wanted. Outta my control."
39,That dude God must owe a mess of child support
40,Love how god plans for babies to be born addicted to opioids. How marvelous He is? Hallelujah
41,Fuck this God dude whose plan was to not let my daughter be born alive.
42,Wait till she finds out about Miscarriages
43,"I was prepared for my second son. I had his carseat, a double stroller, his bassinet, all kinds of clothes, two full boxes of diapers. And in the 33rd week of my pregnancy his heart stopped beating. But that was part of gods plan too, right?"
44,"The Christian God is supposed to be omniscient, meaning they would know about every abortion that will ever occur, meaning every single one is a part of their plan."
45,Great! God can take custody. Think of abortion as the Uber ride to their house.
46,Sky Daddy‚Äôs pullout game is trash
47,Abortion is part of the plan. If it wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôd just flood the world
48,Hypocritical virtue signaling.
49,Yeah but how do you know god's plan wasn't for the fetus to be aborted?
50,"God helps those who help themselves but he also has a plan, so Jesus take the wheel. Love thy neighbour unless they're different from you, sinners deserve eternity in hellfire."
51,"Wouldn't god be the reason for the abortion, since... you know, they planned everything ever?"
52,"Not the firstborn of Egypt though, those he just straight up murdered."
53,Lol and sometimes that plan is turning it into a lil scramble ü§£
54,Do you mean the representatives of god should pay support from their funds
55,Tax the church
56,"If he has a plan for every child, then he must have also planned Paediatric cancers and school shootings then?"
57,"What if his plan is for it to have its brain scrambled and vacuumed out?

![gif](giphy|26BkMYZDrYtAPfX2w)"
58,If God is so prepared then he should be happy abortions are sending him babies that aren't wanted. It can take care of them.
59,"That‚Äôs why you tell people like this, ‚Äúgod wants me to abort this baby, he told me so.‚Äù His will be done and all."
60,"God does love all children, that must be why he allows so many of them to be raped."
61,"If god is prepared for every fertilization (the earliest development), then why does he kill a quarter of them with miscarriage?

Reminds me of the rooster having an omelet at breakfast with the hen, saying, ""They don't taste too bad, and it sure beats sending them to college."""
62,God can have the crib ready then when the woman chooses to terminate.
63,"no, wait. she actually has a point‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why we should keep sending them back to god!"
64,Yeah tax the fucking church
65,Maybe it‚Äôs God‚Äôs plan for that baby to get aborted. Why would he just let some random woman fuck up his plan ü§î
66,Abby Johnson has had abortions.
67,"Better yet, have the church pay it, since they're not paying taxes or anything"
68,"What was god's plan for all the mothers who died giving birth to children who didn't even surrvive before abortion was invented then, hm? If god truly has a plan for everyone there wouldn't be so many young people who die"
69,"Since god is a made up fantasy supported by the church. Let the church pay child support considering god doesn't exist, now way to extract money from a story book. Then again the church is doing just that so lets make them pay."
70,This is such a ridiculous take I almost downvoted this post.
71,"Idk about you, but ""living for 4 incredibly painful hours while you slowly drown in your own bodily fluids because your lungs never fully developed, leaving open cavities in your abdomen that doctors saw months ago but were legally prohibited from aborting a non-viable fetus"" sounds like a truly stupid plan, God."
72,"What was God's plan for me?

Fuck God."
73,I hope some rapist like Brock Turner doesn‚Äôt decide that she should be the mother of his next child.
74,"If cancer, child abuse, and a broken home where no one loves them is god‚Äôs plan, then it‚Äôs a plan that I want nothing to do with."
75,So god isn‚Äôt surprised that a particular embryo is aborted. That‚Äôs the plan for that one. Others he plans to miscarry.
76,"Abby Johnson is a racist, ignorant, lying twunt who thinks we don‚Äôt need to work on poverty issues because ‚Äúthat wouldn‚Äôt be biblical‚Äù and adopted a black son that she‚Äôs totally ok with being racially profiled when he inevitably grows up to be a scary black man because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just good policing.‚Äù"
77,**Fuck** your god.
78,What is his plan for babies that grow up to be serial killers?
79,"If God wants me to have a child he can have full custody.

If the souls of aborted fetuses automatically go to heaven, shouldn‚Äôt they all be aborted? Rather than be born and sin and go to hell."
80,"Ok my plan for this child is A B C... Aaaand aborted, well fuck. I the god of the universe, most powerful being in existence, have been foiled. My will has been opposed and my plans destroyed all by a single mortal. Honestly this just happens waaay too often, I'm sick of it but I won't do anything about it."
81,"This the guns, jesus, babies religious extremist, right?"
82,God's plan for 7.4% of kids in Sub-Saharan Africa is to die before they reach the age of five.
83,"
If abortion is a thing and an omnipotent deity  can plan outcomes from all pregnancies, clearly‚Ä¶ sometimes that plan is abortion now isn‚Äôt it? 

I didn‚Äôt write the rules.

That‚Äôs just how maths works."
84,"If that's the case, god needs to be a bit more careful where he puts the little buggers"
85,Maybe God's plan is to have it die. It's blasphemous to presume.
86,If everything is preordained and planned for by god‚Ä¶ then doesn‚Äôt that mean he planned for those babies to be aborted?
87,"Miscarriages happen naturally. Are those are part of God's plan? If so, what makes you think abortions aren't part of his plan?"
88,Is that why he‚Äôs murdered more than any man or woman on earth? His plan was to do it himself? ü§î
89,"Well, if God's so prepared for the kid, then what's the problem in sending it to him?"
90,"Again, how do you know that abortion ISN'T God's plan?

Assuming God exists and HAS such a ""plan"" which discredits the whole ""God gave you free will"" rhetoric They run to when confronted with the problem of evil."
91,"So, school shootings a divinely mandated?"
92,"God does have a plan for every fetus in the womb.

Some of his plans involve the fetus getting prematurely murked by its host."
93,"Yeah, try telling that to Zeus. I dare ya. It's okay, he doesn't throw lightning bolts in people's faces. Well, not anymore."
94,"‚Ä¶and if they are aborted, that‚Äôs Gods plan as well"
95,I guess he already planned before hand that a certain person will be painfully beheaded using a dull knife by a cartel crew.
96,"God's prepared, that's why it's ok to send the babies up to him"
97,That is a great viewpoint from your privilege.
98,"Oh so THATS why churches bring in all that money and don't pay taxes, so they can help pay for forced births"
99,Someone really needs to get this God person to run the foster care systems then.
100,God wants you to adopt these children and/or give more of your tax dollars to care for them.
