1,"Jesus Christ was supposed to return during that current generation. He's the ultimate absent Dad who went out for cigarettes 2,000 years ago and never came back home. Christian's are so incredibly invested in this idea, and too insecure, to be able to accept that he is never returning and that is because he almost certainly didn't exist in the first place."
2,Mostly they rage because of atrocious spelling.
3,">The source of rage is impotence against the inevitable

They're this close to being self aware."
4,"Can't altar it, eh?"
5,"This gentleman is confused. When left alone, we heathens don't rage at all. It's just a non-issue. We only tend to rage when you ring our doorbells uninvited, or shove your religion down our throats when we are merely minding our own business. Until you get intrusive we don't think about you at all."
6,I only rage if I get kicked in the goads.
7,"So he expect mankind to lay down and die.  People usually rage, because the other outcome is death."
8,"Which is why we have this surge of christian nationalism.   These people with their projection.

They are going to end up on the shit heap of history while still waiting to be raptured lol."
9,Mostly because you goddamn Christians won't shut the fuck up and leave us the fuck alone.
10,"Takes me back.

Way back in the 80's(?) there was a band called Guadalcanal Diary. They had a great song called, ""Why Do the Heathen Rage?"""
11,The irony of posting that with the picture being of standing next to that quote... Chef's kiss.
12,Is a heathen rage anything like a pagan rave? If so let’s do it. 👍
13,Cords or chords? Jesus hates music?
14,This guy's name is Rusty Thomas!  LMFAO!  I don't need to guess where he's been sticking it.
15,"Wait what's this with the altar? 

Also is God playing chords? Neat 🙂"
16,The only part of me that is raging is my eyes after looking at this clown’s outfit.
17,"Okay, so what I got from this is that God has a band, people are raging at altars, and someone got kicked in the goads. Also, the fruitcakes admitted their issues stem from sexual disfunction. Am I anywhere near right?"
18,Man I’m surprised dude was able to crawl out of his own ass to make this post.
19,I thought this was going to be about REM.
20,"Better argument to them is that with their brand of political religiosity, if/when he returns they will spend endless 24hr news cycles about getting rid of him as ""yet another socialist""."
21,"The end is near doomsday cult aspect of the NT is fairly consistent, to the extent the bible is consistent about anything:

>Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. 	

James 5:8 
			 



>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things 	**which must shortly come to pass.** 

Revelation 1:1

>But the end of all things is at hand. 

1 Peter 4:7"
22,I think he did exist but as someone utterly unrecognizable to modern christians mostly due to various things being attributed to him that were taken from rival cult leaders like John the Baptist.
23,"I mean, there was that one guy who sacrificed somebody in 2 Kings 3. Would that do it for ya?"
24,Sounds like a good time to me.
25,I left his name in because he’s actually a semi-famous Christian blogger in those circles.
26,Sounds about right to me.
