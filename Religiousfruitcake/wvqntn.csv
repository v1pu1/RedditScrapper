Option 1. I walk into a Mandir and declare myself an atheist; saying I don't believe in the existence of their deities. I am treated as they treat themselves, neither judging nor condemning.

Option 2. I walk into a Mosque and declare myself an atheist, saying I don't believe in the existence of their deity. I am treated with contempt and hatred. I am told I will burn in hell; and one, two, or many of the worshippers will wish me harm, and do me harm. HILARIOUSLY FUNNY."
45,Of course. 🤗

The fact that you are a child rape apologist with your whataboutism demonstrates you are a wholly deplorable and despicable human being."
