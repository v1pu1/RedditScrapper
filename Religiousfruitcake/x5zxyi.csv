1,Satan says LGBTQ+ rights! Yay Satan!
2,"As always, Satan is the logical and compassionate choice."
3,"there's sick ass demons, protected sex, drugs, people with their own identities, gay people, and hedonism in hell. sounds kinda awesome ngl"
4,"Wait. Satan, as in, the snake in the Garden of Eden? That Satan? Funny. Because he told Eve the truth when he was saying that what God told the man was wrong."
5,Christians stop making Satan as the cool guy challenge: impossible.
6,I just went to his Twitter and lost braincells.
7,Funny enough the satanism bible literally says it's a work of fiction in the beginning too lmao it's so self aware and its literally just a philosophy book giving advice on how to live. Also there's literally a chapter called satanic sex which sounds metal as fuck lmao.
8,"This guy forgot one important thing: Satan says cut your hair, god says it’s a sin!"
9,"Isn't it amusing how the image of Satan and his actions were evolving with time? In the past, he was responsible for tempting people to murder, steal, rape or be atheist, disobedient to church and priests. But nowadays, he's tempting people to be gay, change gender or belong to LGBT community. Maybe in the future, he'll be tempting people to have a chip in brain or use AI to create art or music, lol."
10,"""You don't decide what you love. My poorly translated, multiple thousand year old book does that for you."""
11,"Lots of gods worshiped by men define love and many of those definitions contradict each other and are illegal in civilised, democratic societies. Like calling the human meat sacrifice of an innocent virgin may be called ""love"" by christians, but in my country it's illegal and immoral."
12,jEsUs Is LoVe¡
13,The dude admits God is bored and created his on villain lol
14,God defines love by hate.  How wonderful is Satan that he loves unconditionally and teaches tolerance and acceptance?!
15,"Love is defined by man because that’s how language works.  Because Yahweh isn’t part of the English speech community he doesn’t get to decide what words mean, since words are defined by how speakers of the relevant language use them."
16,"A trans man can not be a woman.

A trans woman can not be a man.

I agree, but in a different way than he thinks..."
17,"""A man can't be a woman.""

Is it just me, or do these transphobic Christians only fear monger about trans women? It's like trans men don't exist in their eyes."
18,If you spend time talking to satan maybe a doctor is who you make your next call to and say I am talking to the devil. They’ll know what to do!
19,What is love?
20,"This guy is a total scumbag. Contradicts himself every couple of days just on his Twitter feed. Says false prophets only want your money a couple days after promoting his Jebus clothing line, condemns schools for ""brainwashing students"" while advocating locking kids in a Christian echo chamber. Given how much he wails about trans people and his confession he's an ""ex"" porn addict I'd bet anything this guy's has terabytes of trans porn on his system."
21,"Intersex people exist, so either god’s ok with what he made and so too should be his fanclub, or he fucked up and shouldn’t be taken seriously. Seems to me his fanclub is in no position to question the state of affairs either way."
22,"He forgot to include this important final thought:

""And everyone who doesn't believe what i believe on these topics will be tortured forever in hell."""
23,"Yknow god seems a bit like a tyrant, no? “Do these very specific things that only I have the power to make otherwise you’ll burn eternally” seems a bit tyrannical to me"
24,"Same god that made a bet with satan resulting in killing a guy's family. Then watched the guy suffer and come crawling to his narcissistic ass for his ""love""

Idk, cuddles and emotional vulnerability with my gf sounds a lot better that whatever the fuck that is. But I guess shouldn't kinkshame."
25,Can a man walk on water?
26,"So by this reasoning, and my word I use that term loosely, I cannot love my daughter, brother and sister, nieces and dear friends since I don't for a second believe in sky daddy of the monstrous beard and dubious morality? Well, dang. Guess my overwhelming loyalty and affection will just be an aberration in their skewed, narrow, moth eaten world view."
27,I wish I thought Satan was real. I like that guy’s style.
28,This fucking guy again…
29,"If I had to choose between the Satan religion and traditional Christian churches, I guess I'm going to go with the goat god"
30,Somehow satan predates christianity to him
31,Tell Him no
32,I read that as Santa
33,Well at least god has nothing against transmascs
34,Ask this idiot if he eats pork.
35,"If any questions about your faith are considered evil, it's a fucking cult"
36,"

Satan respects your pronouns."
37,Don't even need the protected sex in hell. STDs are god's punishment not Satan's and you can't get pregnant in hell because no new souls to make a baby at worst you'd spawn another souless succubus/incubus. So go wild.
38,"As long as that hedonism includes aftercare cuddles and baking cookies together, sign me the 'hell' up."
39,"The snake being Satan is the Christian reboot version. The original was pre-written version was likely far more animist in nature.

Something worth noting, God didn't warn Eve. He warned Adam who then failed to warn Eve. Then even after that, Adam chose to to eat the fruit anyway. Eve is probably the most innocent one in the bible."
40,"No shit. Trolled the hell out of him myself. Like damn dude, tell me you're a bigot without telling me you're a bigot."
41,It actually is of god philosophy the satanic bible I mean. Idk how people think.... and the men practiced sodomy between themselves and the angels thoughout sodom and gomorrah then feel like be a better person after. The says not an actual quote scripture whatever from the holy bibble by the way.
42,I thought you had to cut your hair for god?
43,"Maybe stop giving kids fucked up sarcomas and birth defects, and then we'll talk, okay, big guy?"
44,"I've never met anyone who spent time talking to Satan, but I've met thousands who claim to talk to God. Those are the people who need to call a doctor, though they probably don't ""believe"" they need one or that he could help."
45,Baby don’t hurt me
46,"As a pan guy, I would like to have both a succubus and an incubus."
47,"That's actually true I've actually thought about that, didn't she say she didn't know or something?"
48,"Technically the Snake is just that, a snake it's why his punishment was to lose all limbs - it's a mythological explanation for why snakes are limbless. Then Christians made him Satan but never explained why Almighty God's punishment doesn't stick."
49,That's what they told us in parochial school. I tried the Samson defense multiple times but I kept getting the old testament vs new testament shtick they only bring up when the old testament isn't in their favor
50,"No but I have met/seen a few who claimed to BE Satan. My personal favorite was this episode of cops I saw back in the 90s late one night. (I believe the drug induced theory at the time was if we were watching it we'd see them coming.)

They pick up this guy walking on the freeway. Cops are super cordial, sir you can't walk down the freeway. Guy ain't having it, I'm just trying to get home. This goes back and forth for a good while, cops offer him a ride so he doesn't have to but he just wants them gone etc. Eventually they ask him for ID and he doesn't have any. Won't tell them his name or anything else. I forget what he finally did but they arrest him. They're headed to the precinct and the guy in the back seat says, you have no idea who I am do you? No sir you didn't have ID and you wouldn't tell us. You really don't know do you? No we don't sir.... I am Satan.

The best part is apparently they never did find any ID or fingerprints or anything because the blurb at the end that lists sentences and such says, Satan is currently under observation at the San Diego (or wherever it was) institute for the insane."
51,"> I've never met anyone who spent time talking to Satan,

After playing a few rounds of _Helltaker_ I kind of wish I _could_..."
52,Saints row flashbacks
53,Just call yourself Bo Dennis
54,As a trans girl I'd like to be a succubus/incubus. Wonder what kind of work history Satan asks for on the application?
55,And snakes have done alright as a species with no legs
56,">The best part is apparently they never did find any ID or fingerprints or anything because the blurb at the end that lists sentences and such says, Satan is currently under observation at the San Diego (or wherever it was) institute for the insane.

😂🤣😂  That's hilarious!!

Depending upon how old he was, it's entirely possible he'd been living ""under the radar"" his whole life. 

Back in the late 70's/ early 80's, I knew a woman who lived like that. She had had extremely abusive parents-- the scars were very apparent-- and in her early teens, she grabbed her birth certificate and social security card, ran away and burned all evidence she'd ever existed. No one knew her real name, how old she was, or anything about her, but the theater kids at the local junior College took her in and became her ""family"".  I lost track of her after I moved away, but I think of her time and again, and wonder how she's doing. 

Even though the story of ""San Diego Satan"" is funny, the fact that there are people who have survived horrible trauma and have fallen through the cracks of society is really sad. I wish e would do better by our fellow living entities."
57,No more
58,My Senses are telling me you'd get a callback at least 😜
