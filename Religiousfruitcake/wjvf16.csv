1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,One clown. One guy taking the piss.
2,"Had one where I am in Ireland. People kept complaining to the council and after a few weekends he got banned for being a noise nuisance. Usually it's just the JWs with a poster board, but they're quiet!

Edit: looked up local news, after that guy they ended up banning amplifiers in public spaces without permission!"
3,I‚Äôm starting to hate Christians more and more every day I see stuff like this
4,"I lived in several big European cities and saw many idiots, but never religious ones. In the West, that seems to be an American specialty (even if we no doubt have some as well, just very few in comparison)"
5,"If these crazy religious people had their shit together they would have used that advertising as a way to let people know where to find good drugs. Different scripture would let you know the product they sell, like this sign says meth sold here."
6,"All of my comments are from pre-covid.

My experiences have almost exclusively been on the same spot in downtown Ottawa, in between the Rideau Center and the Byward Market. I've seen numerous different bible thumpers there, ranging from an individual with a megaphone, to a small congregation with a professional public address system. They can get very graphic, referring to sex acts, drugs, and violence, that will condemn you to hell. If you tell them off, they immediately focus on you. Three women surrounded us after my wife told them to fu*k-off. They only broke off when we were getting on the elevator to the LRT. It's really annoying because it is right beside a major transit stop, and restaurant patios. We didn't go to The Grand Pizzeria because of the noise outside."
7,"Add ""baseball"" to the satanic activities list, it appears..."
8,"The fucking incorrect grammar on ""ye"" is what is triggering more but that's just because i'm not hearing them."
9,These people with megaphones will actually harass some people just to get reactions too. They need to be illegal.
10,Jesus did *clearly* state that Mariners fans go directly to hell.
11,"Oh, that makes sense!

I went to a convention in DC and megaphone dudes were screaming at the line outside about scripture.

I thought they specifically had issues with the ungodliness of anime! The fact that they might just be doing it anytime anything happens makes sense in a weird way"
12,I know the Westboro Baptist Church has been doing that for years. But I think they target public events where they try to provoke people.
13,Flashing the devil sign ROFL. What a clown
14,Birmingham on Saturday was teeming with these people. Mainly around Edgbaston stadium
15,"FRUITCAKE: You‚Äôre going to HELL for going to this ballgame!

ME: Dude, I‚Äôm a Mets fan. I‚Äôve done plenty of time in hell."
16,Do you think they all know each other? The megaphone guys?
17,"Are they trying to spread the Good News upon the whole of creation? Because I think Seattle has had the Good News already, hehehe.

In fact literally EVERYWHERE (except of course for Sentinel Island) there are Christians of all denominations, so I would think the missionaries' task is finished!"
18,"- Dude is eating a burger, and posing for the shot

- Doing sign of the horns

- In a mariners tee, ostensibly the ball game OP mentioned

- No religious fruitcakey paraphernalia on

I think homie on the left is just there to eat a burger and vibe, guys."
19,But they are correct
20,"I am in Ireland too and have noticed a rise in religious nutters lately,  also signs with a pic of the face on the shroud of truin and ""repent"" popped up on esbjerg poles"
21,American Christianity breeds mental illness. It's a pandemic.
22,On Oxford Street in London there's frequently one or two of them outside the big Nike shop.
23,"Dude, it's basically everything. From fish fanciers to mouth breathers, nobody's righteous enough to be them."
24,"Aw. What's the fun of that? Let em rant, lol. Adds some spice to a bland day."
25,"Yeah, it's everything. Any activity other than sitting in the shed waving a Bible while f*cking goats is unacceptable."
26,They are the worst. What they do is truly despicable.
27,I don‚Äôt think that guy is part of it.  He‚Äôs a baseball fan. So probably mocking the other dude.
28,I am the guy on the left lol
29,God sacrificed himself to himself to appease himself. This was necessary because a long time ago a woman was convinced by a talking snake with legs to eat a piece of fruit.
30,Why the hell would you want to go to Oxford street ?
31,I do my best to avoid being worthy.
32,"In big cities every block is a residential block, meaning they're doing in front of people's homes."
33,Yes they are. My high school endured a school shooting in 2001. A few months later they showed up at our graduation and protested. They said our school was being punished by God for having a gay-straight alliance club at school.
34,"God: ‚ÄúAll the sports balls in the garden are okay to play with, but the baseball you must never touch!‚Äù"
35,üôå
36,I had a project nearby so had to get the tube to Oxford Circus. Not my first choice of location but you go where the work is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
37,It used to always be the Hare Krishna blocking Oxford street with their trains of orange followers and bald heads
