1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Stop thinking and accept everything we say, dummies."
2,"Who are you gonna trust? Us claiming to know the deepest secrets of the universe, which point to giving us money and power, or your lying common sense and basic logic."
3,This makes its own gravy.
4,Cannot allow people to think critically for themselves.
5,I reason that faith is a mental disorder that causes those afflicted to lose the ability to discern fact from fiction...
6,"""Truth and facts get in the way of my profits and ability to control you.

7,Reason will prevail!
8,"This is actually more or less a direct quote from Martin Luther, the frontman of the Protestant Revolution. Just saying… if you want to know where the crazy flavor of Christianity in the U.S. got started, he and John Calvin are the ones to point fingers at.

The concept of faith alone being sufficient for salvation just does not gel well with encouraging righteous behavior, which is one of the main things that religion is supposed to do! And the idea that God decided in advance who is going to heaven and who is going to hell and there is nothing we can do to change that is even *worse*. It means that the religion provides zero incentive to be a good person, and it makes God look like **an absolute douchecanoe**. Fuck you, Calvinism. Fuck you."
9,"Sometimes they are just accidentally right.

Gotta love their dumbness."
10,I cannot make this out. Wtf is it tryna say?

12,Yes! We’ve found common ground. I also believe you are not reasonable.
13,Oh no! Talk about saying the quiet part out loud.  This church has gone full circle and made an enemy out of reason itself LOL.
14,There is no reason to have faith.
15,For whatever reason I kept reading „worship“ as the last word of the sentence and really thought I was too stupid to understand lol
16,"If reason says your religion is wrong, then... your religion is wrong"
17,It would be easier to believe if the representatives they chose weren't so fucking stupid.
18,"""If you want to get your soul to heaven

Trust in me now, dont you judge or question

You are broken now but faith can heal you

Just do everything that i tell you to do""
