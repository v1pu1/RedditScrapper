1,"An unborn child shouldn't pay the penalty for the fathers sins. Fine, Fair enough. 

*_But the mother should?_*"
2,People need to stop pretending that a fetus is a child.
3,"Yeah, better let the mother to be litterally pay for the father's sin...makes much more sense"

6,Blaming a baby for the sins of the father is actually what religious ppl should totally support.
7,Yeah it's totally not hamstringing the mother with the 'sins of the father' for the rest of her life you fucking clown shoes.
8,Zygote aint baby Craig.
9,You mean like God supposedly does with the whole original sin thing?
10,">It is not justice to make an innocent unborn child pay the penalty for the biological father's sins.

Meanwhile, the Bible:

>""(...) for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me (...)

This is literally the SECOND COMMANDMENT (Exodus 20:5). You know, one of those laws Christians think are so deep and important and perfect? 

This particular rule is apparently so important to Yahweh that it was repeated in Exodus 34:7:

>""(...) he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.""

And quoted in Deuteronomy 5:9:

>""(...) for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, (...)""

Then there's the Exodus story. 

First, Yahweh murders all of the Egyptian firstborn (Exodus 11:5):

>""Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.""

 Then he dicks over the Israelites for good measure (Numbers 32:13):

>The Lord‚Äôs anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.

Speaking of dicking his favorite people over, remember how Yahweh tortured and murdered David's newborn son for being conceived in sin? (2 Samuel 12:13-14)

>""The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for the Lord, the son born to you will die.‚Äù

And then there's all the racism that's justified by stating that their ancestors pissed Yahweh off generations ago. A famous example would be Ham, whose curse is cited by white supremacist Christians *to this day* as ""proof"" that black people are inferior (Genesis 9:24-25):

>When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, he said, ‚ÄúCursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.‚Äù

The Flood fable itself is also an excellent example of Yahweh murdering countless innocents (including children and the unborn) because he was angry at their parents (and the way they were conceived, when it comes to the Nephilim). 

Some more petty racism from Deuteronomy 23:2-3:

>No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation. No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation.

And of course, there are all the genocides in the Old Testament - Numbers is basically an entire book dedicated to all the tribes that were eradicated by those glorified bandits Yahweh calls his favorite people. For one prime example, look at what happened to the Midianites (Numbers 31:17-18):

>""Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.""

Oh, and let's not forget that time Yahweh punished ALL OF HUMANITY with eternal damnation because two people who literally didn't know any better ate a fruit. Killing an innocent (himself) was the only way he could bring himself to forgive humans for being the way he created them. Considering that this belief is at the core of Christianity, you'd think they'd understand this at least, but apparently even that's too much to ask."
11,Oh but you are perfectly fine with making that innocent actual girl child pay for the sins of the father. Pos
12,People can't fathom not existing.
13,"What?! That‚Äôs an *extremely* biblical concept. 

*‚ÄúYou shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.‚Äù* (Exodus 20:5)

*‚ÄúThe Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.‚Äù* (Numbers 14:18)

I grew up in a fundie home. You better believe that God is always threatening to make those punishments echo down through the generations.

I would also like to bring up why God Almighty himself performs 900,000 to 1,000,000 abortions in the United States each and every year if he is so against them‚Ä¶? I lost my first pregnancy this way after being married for four years and deciding to try to start a family. It was my first pregnancy ever and it was rewarded with a miscarriage. I want answers."
14,"He's probably an inbred too, that's why he defends his point so hard."
15,Christian fundies are bat ü¶á shit üí© crazy folks.
16,god would never kill an innocent child as punishment for sin... except for his own?
17,"I don‚Äôt like abortion either, but dying in the womb hardly sounds that bad. We fear death because we know things. The fetus knows nothing and has none of the fear or understanding of death that we have. If there‚Äôs a heaven, they go straight there without a care in the world. Doesn‚Äôt sound so bad."
18,"These people are fucking awful. Not only is it punishing the mother, but they never take into account how it would hurt the kid if they were born. The kid would have a shit life, the mother would have a shit life, and the rapists genes shouldn't be passed on."
19,Actually being anti-rape and anti-incest is pretty progressive for many right-wingers.
20,Except it's not a child. At worst it's a fetus.
21,"The wrong assumption they will never budge on is that it is a living baby. No amount of science about the fact that the synapse hasn't even started yet (in many cases) so it can't possibly be sentient or conscious, and it isn't viable yet, will ever seem to sway them."
22,"So, you are saying people shouldn't pay for the sins of their fathers? Hmm, seems to me, that somewhere in that book of theirs, it says something very specific about this. And it goes directly against what they are saying here. Religion, conservatism and hypocrisy, a trio you rarely see separated."
23,Wait according to these people aren't we all still being punished for Adam and eve's sin thousands of years later? Religion is a fucking joke man
24,An inbred child of rape shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for its fathers sins! So I‚Äôll force it to live with whatever deformities or abnormalities it might have from being inbred. And make it live with the shame of being an inbred rape baby. And force the traumatised mother to birth and raise it which won‚Äôt make her hate the child at all and won‚Äôt cause any abuse of the already disabled child. Yes this life I‚Äôm forcing it to live isn‚Äôt punishment at all!
25,"Without the whole ""punishing the offspring for the fathers sins"", christianity falls apart pretty quickly. 
I mean there would be no reason for jesus sacrifice without adams original sin."
26,"Abortion is a basic human right. To have control over your own physical form is a given right that every human should have, outside the bounds of politics and religious outrage.


I don‚Äôt have to donate my kidneys to save another persons life. Does that make me a murderer? No. That makes me somebody that has rights and chose to keep my body intact. I do not want to sacrifice my own physical form and quality of life for somebody else.


An ‚Äúunborn child‚Äù isn‚Äôt even human. But let‚Äôs say they are for sake of the argument. Labor itself is extremely intense, painful, and can even kill the mother from unforeseen complications. 9 months of pregnancy, with raging hormones, pains, and your body being sapped of all its worth. For what, a baby that‚Äôs a result of rape? Hell, to have a baby that you didn‚Äôt even want in the first place?? That‚Äôs messed up. Oh, and I‚Äôm sure the parents here know how much hell a child can bring, both financially and emotionally, especially after birth.


Corpses have more bodily autonomy than people these days.


*Literal corpses*


If they‚Äôre so pro-life, and want to protect the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù, why are there still thousands of tiny humans in our  adoption and foster systems?? I thought it didn‚Äôt matter if you want the child, or if you‚Äôre financially ready?   There‚Äôs lots of kiddos literally begging and pleading for someone to take care of them, and many more to come that will never know the loving care of a family.


Pro-choice is more beneficial to the livelihood of children than ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù can even fathom."
27,That comment has 157 likes....
28,"thats  the christian doctrine of original sin condemn all of humanity for ""being sinful"" because adam and eve"
29,If only men could get pregnant after getting pegged. Watch how fast church elders change their minds on that bit of law.
30,What ever happened to dashing the infants against the rocks?
31,Probably  from a person who wants to kill trans  people.
32,Do YoU eVeN READ tHe BiBlE bRo?! God blamed/judged people for the sins of their father.
33,"Its ok that you‚Äôre dumb as a box of rocks, have 12 genetic ailments and absolutely no ability to ever provide for yourself Billy, because at least you haven‚Äôt paid for your father/uncles sins."
34,"Um excuse me good sir , isnt half the concept of the entire religion that we pay for our forefathers sins?

Original sin and all that. Everyone's born into sin , etc"
35,"While I think this is a bad opinion, I actually respect this position more than I respect people who would allow abortion for fetuses that result from rape and disallow abortion for fetuses that are the same ""age"" that result from consensual sex. Those people just want to punish people for having consensual sex by forcing the fetus to term, they demonstrably don't care about life. At least the person who is against abortion in all circumstances is consistent."
36,isn't the entire point of some religion based on the sins of the mother being suffered by the entirety of the unborn?
37,So it looks like rapists will be able to choose their babies momma. Wow! Just wow!
38,Sins of the Father!? Is that a Metal gear solid reference
39,"I have been thinking this a very long time, and haven't ever said it before, because I don't like wishing bad things on people. I hope a woman he loves and cares about is put in a situation in which they need an abortion. Specifically from rape. I feel terrible saying that, like genuinely awful, but I don't think these people will ever understand someone else's perspective until they're put into the same position. Abrahamuc religions seem to just erode away empathy and understanding. 

I really can't believe I typed that. I'm disgusted. Don't upvote this. It shouldn't be celebrated."
40,"""Sure cus they are less human then men"" ~GOP"
41,Which is funny because the whole linchpin of their entire religion is that we are paying for our ancestor's original sin
42,Yeah but these people believe sky papa gave the fetus a soul when it was 2 cells big..they‚Äôre fucking morons who REFUSE to understand anything that‚Äôs not part of their interpretation of their book..
43,It's like saying cookie dough is a cookie
44,"They can't get past this idea that any fertilized egg = a baby. No amount of science seems to get through to them. At a certain stage it has no synapse, surely anyone reasonable would agree then it can't be sentient, but they don't care. They insist that it's just like if you stabbed a born, viable, living infant to death and won't hear otherwise."
45,"Sorry we only care about the father and the (hopefully male) offspring child of -rape-, I mean god"
46,This comment is gold. Lmao
47,You mean at best it's a fetus right
48,"But it's their choice to be sodomite degenerate amongE so its okay, just spring cleaning. /s"
49,Sadly allot of people especially the religious conservative types lack empathy and don‚Äôt give a shit or understand till it happens to them.
50,"it's not an abortion if they keep it secret. they would happily tell themselves ""this is different."""
51,"Who the fuck said that

And the most concerning part is that 50 people upvoted you."
52,"Jesus would give pregnant women muddy water to drink, and if the baby was stillborn, the woman had committed adultery and shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for the child. If anyone can find what passage this is, IOU.


Jesus, the son of God, was giving women abortions."
53,"Cookie dough tastes so good though, until it gives food poisoning."
54,Unmilled grain = cookie change my mind
55,"Here‚Äôs the thing, you‚Äôre right, they‚Äôre stuck on that, the sad part is that this is an irrelevant red herring. 

What qualifies as a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù is a question for philology, or even linguistics, biology doesn‚Äôt really enter so much into it. Not as much as people assume. These labels are arbitrary. It‚Äôs also irrelevant. 

You can call a foetus a baby, a toddler, a teenager, hell a granny. It doesn‚Äôt matter. None of these categories have the right they want to grant a foetus. To inhabit a human against their will, and use that human to sustain themselves. No one has that right. We don‚Äôt even force blood donations, let alone something like a kidney. Why should we force a pregnancy? In the end the answer to that is the same as the one given here. To punish the pregnant person‚Ä¶ 

Bodily autonomy is a human right in the entire developed world, and the anti choice efforts in the US just confirms something we already knew. The US no longer qualifies as part of the developed world‚Ä¶"
56,"Oh they know, they just don't want to know because then they have to admit that it is all about making sure half the population has less human rights then they do just so they can feel they matter more"
57,"Duh, conception is the moment the soul slips in! (/s for Poe's Law)"
58,"It's a smart rhetorical move for whoever came up with the argument.  Once you make something into murder, arguably one of the worst things possible, you won't be able to change people's opinions.  

The right does a great job of creating arguments like this but they also self select for people who can hold contradiction so even if you can convince them of anything they will just brush it off by the next time you see them."
59,Yes because women aren‚Äôt actually people‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the bottom line of most of the anti women rhetoric online‚Ä¶
60,No

65,It was God himself in the old testament I think
66,Let‚Äôs be honest here..given the culture it came from it probably wasn‚Äôt so the woman wouldn‚Äôt be responsible for the child
67,"To be fair in most parts of the developed world abortion can be done up to 8-20 weeks, not in the whole pregnancy."
68,"Could be an embryo, even less complex. But neither is a child..."
69,"The only things I found was that he said that some women lie about rape (not all but some, he's right) and that women can shut down pregnancies (he's wrong there).

But nothing about how women are less human than men."
70,"Listen, I'm pro choice. But don't pretend you can't live without having sex without a condom. Or you can't get sterilised. Or even just have sex. You still have the choice by not fucking.

That being said I'm still pro choice."
71,"To be fair in most of the developed world, that is not a catholic hellhole, abortion can be done throughout the whole pregnancy if the womans life or health is at risk of damage and that includes her mental health.  Also abortions before viability and after viability are done by medical professionals and fully paid for by the state"
72,Absolutely.
73,"Estimated statistics for lying about rape are 2%. By justifying rape, all these men are putting women below them. Are you dense?"

75,"So Canada, South Korea and China. Others seem to have restrictions on the week of pregnancy, and mind you I‚Äôm not prolife. Just don‚Äôt be like ‚ÄúAmerica bad‚Äù.

And for the second part, that's your own interpretation. I'm not defending rape but you can't say ""all republicans think women are below men""  based on your interpretation. 

Wait, you mean that he thinks that women are below men because he thinks that there are false accusations ? Are you a fucking clown ?"

South Korea and China, didn't you just specify the developed world, are we changing the parameters now because america is indeed a dystopian hellhole for women's rights to basic reproductive health and medical care. Hmm

Also South Korea completely decriminalized abortion in 2021!

The overwhelming majority of Europe is NOT way more strict with abortion regardless of how desperately often the RaRARa Murica crowd and the antichoicers keep repeating that lie!
