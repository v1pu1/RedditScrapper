1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"To this I would reply ""Okay, but I get to choose the denomination. So from now on anyone who opposes the Book of Mormon will be subject to criminal prosecution."" Because this is exactly why you can't have freedom *of religion* without freedom *from religion*."
2,"Have any of these people ever read the constitution?

This is obviously a rhetorical question. It‚Äôs clear they have not, will not and do not care."
3,"We call this theocracy, and it‚Äôs illegal in the U.S. Not that republicans seem to care anymore. I‚Äôm an independent and I hope everybody votes straight blue in the coming years. Christianity needs to learn its place in this country‚Ä¶which is not in government!"
4,"How flimsy and weak is your belief system that you not only have to outlaw criticism of it, you also have to *pay* someone to stand up there on the pulpit and tell you it‚Äôs true every week on Sunday and possibly again on Wednesday?"
5,"Considering how much the shit from American ""Christians"" goes against Jesus' teachings, I'm not sure they really want blasphemy laws..."
6,"Oh how I'd love to get a time machine and fucking zap myself into the future or a future where all religions ceased to exist. Bloody hell, religions have been the root of major evil doings throughout human history."
7,I hate the Abrahamic religions.
8,Christian Taliban
9,"So, punishment for insulting skydaddy but none for spreading harmful misinformation"
10,"Oh no, all powerful sky daddy is helpless to stop people from saying critical things about him."
11,The very people who voted to put Jesus on the cross and they think they will be welcomed by him.
12,"Sounds fair.

So, for first blasphemy I nominate: any mention of Hell whatsoever.

Hell is a concept attached to Christianity after Christ's death, so it's blasphemous and any Christian who associates it with anything other than Norse paganism is a blasphemer.

Second blasphemy: holding the incorrect day as Sabbath.  Gotta go the same day of the week as Jesus did."
13,"Fuck God, Jesus, AND the Holy Spirit. I worship the old gods."
14,Everyone is to the right of Charlemagne until they‚Äôre getting worked over with a belt sander in a farm outside the city.
15,It's only called Charlemagne if it's from the Charlemagne region of France. Otherwise it's called 'sparkling rage'
16,Jesus fucking Christ she‚Äôs a nut job
17,Tell me you‚Äôre a frustrated incel without saying you‚Äôre a frustrated incel
18,"There's a lovely, beautifully simple response to this:

""You know who else likes laws that make blasphemy a crime? The Taliban."""
19,"1. X knows everything (that can be known. Not falsehoods.)
2. It is possible to know what it is like to personally enjoy eating puppies alive with pain enhancers. 
3. Therefore, X knows what it is like to personally enjoy eating puppies alive with pain enhancers.

Is this blasphemy?

Should it be illegal to make arguments about unspecified X‚Äôs?"
20,"The big gotcha is right their in your oroiginal statement. Every reasonable person, including the majority of Christians would find your statement despicable. It‚Äôs more likely to drive people away from your fairy tale than towards it. And I don‚Äôt care about unreasonable delusional zealots like you, or those who agree with you. So you can get lost‚Ä¶"
21,Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah
22,"Sometimes it feels like the reason the American people have had such beef with Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran etc... is because realistically they're very fucking similar. They're both are staunchly religious and blinded by capitalistic greed.
The closer two tribes are to one another, generally speaking, the more at each others throats they'll be. 

Just to clarify, I'm not talking about American government/military beef with them. I mean the general publics beef with them."
23,"Ok I‚Äôll bite. 

Fuck Jesus. He ain‚Äôt real. 
Fuck god. 
And fuck all religions, they cause mental illness. 

And fuck you for trying to institute a Theocracy. 
Go to SA if you want that shit."
24,"Right of Charlemagne, eh?! How well would he like being an indentured servant to a feudal lord then?!"
25,"Do you know how many times I saw ""Jesus Christ"" to ridiculous news headlines every day?? 


Jesus F***ing Christ to this one."
26,"It should be illegal for the government to make laws endorsing a religion, oh wait..."
27,üñïüèæchrist
28,Jesus fucking Christ fuck Jesus in the ass! Religion is pure fucking evil.
29,"Oh...oh. can we make Mennonite the compulsory religion? Yes, being pacifists would mean they would have to get rid of their guns. Unless they want to ensure freedom of religion also means protecting freedom from religion."
30,"That's a really silly question. I'm thinking that they don't even know how to spell ""constitution""."
31,They don‚Äôt care tbh
32,Have these people even actually read the Bible?
33,They don‚Äôt actually support the constitution just like they don‚Äôt actually support freedom of speech. It‚Äôs a means to an end.
34,But will be the **first** to remind you of ‚Äòmuh ryghtz‚Äô.
35,"More and more christians are openly stating their wish to abolish the 1st amendment now that they are very open and vocal about destroying the separation of church and state. They want a christian theocracy and are inching closer to that goal. 

I see a lot of people comparing their rhetoric to Islam. No...this isnt Islam. This is returning to the traditional biblical christian family values that made cheistianity a brutal, genocidal, misogynistic and dangeous dominant world religion in the first place. The OOPs reference to Charlemagne is a dead give-away. 

Charlemagne was pure genocidal evil and would have given Hitler a run for his money if he had the same weapons of war Hitler had. Which explains why christians speak so highly of him and many still deem him the Saint of the Holy Roman Empire.

Edit: 1st not 2nd amendment. Got pew pews on the brain. Lol"
36,They don‚Äôt care about the constitution. A deep believer of any kind will always put their sacred book and their sky daddies above any law. They only claim to respect the law. Ask around you what they‚Äôd do if a law crossed their beliefs
37,Christianity needs to learn its place........... in the dustbin of history
38,"Wish we could get someone from outside the parties, im sick of both sides nothing gets done cause we're too focused on infighting"
39,What religion does it again on Wednesday? I know Sat then Wed but not Sun and Wed
40,Most of them around here vehemently believe Jesus is a white American man
41,You may live to see it.
42,It isn‚Äôt just the Abrahamic religions that influence people to do evil. ALL religions can do that.
43,Literally and these same Christians talk shit about extremists in Islam for having the same sentiments
44,Y‚Äôall Queda
45,"Some of those that work forces, are the same that bore crosses."
46,"I say fuck all gods and all religions. Worshiping any of them is silly and doesn't help explain anything. But you do you, so long as you aren't trying to turn your religious believes in to laws or force them on people, I wouldn't care. Problem is, ALL organized religion does that eventually, and with bad results."
47,My cat is the only deity I need!
48,"üëè
And to this, I‚Äôd add to the person who said ‚Äúpublic blasphemy against Christ‚Äù: if Jesus was born and as your ‚Äúholy book‚Äù says lived as man on earth, he had dna. DNA. Not a messiah. Just a dude. A dude.

Edit: wording add to, not ask"
49,Sparkling WHITE rage.
50,Ikr ? I don‚Äôt even understand what Is the meaning of using Charlemagne in this tweet
51,Cue their heads exploding at the accusation you just leveled against them.
52,"Wait! I know this one! C-o-n-s-t-i-2-s-h-u-n.

/s"
53,But suddenly they care about it when it comes to guns.
54,They've heard what their pastor says is the important parts of the Bible. Which may or may not actually be in there.
55,"Oh. No.  And mostly wouldn't understand what they were reading even if they tried. No, they own a Bible so they can wave it above their heads in church and yell ""amen!"" every time the preacher spouts some idiotic drivel."
56,Now youre asking for way too much
57,Or freedom at all. Because they don't even understand what that is.
58,Catholics love a good Wednesday mass.
59,"I know, I just hate the Abrahamic ones the most."
60,"Idk Buddhism seems pretty good rn

These people could use some fucking enlightenment"
61,"I'm pagan, so it's against my religion to try to coerce or force someone to do/believe anything. 

I'm tired of Christians telling me I'm going to Hell. If Heaven is full of modern day Xtians, then I would rather go to Hell, thanks."
62,"Whenever you generalize about ALL any group, you're a bigot."
63,"I also choose this guys cat, hail the dominant species"
64,The mass slaughter adds a touch of piquancy...
65,"Like the bible, it is evidently not an important document. But rather, a malleable shield for one's predetermined faith."
66,"There have even been some fringe pastors asserting that Jesus is not the Messiah, Trump is. It's nuts"
67,They‚Äôve heard what their pastor has cherry-picked from the Bible to align with whatever happens to be on their agenda at that particular momentüòâ
68,"Most likely because you are most familiar with their brand of assholiness. Other religions have just as bad aspects, but they can be different from the ones we are being oppressed with."
69,You clearly have never seen Burmese Buddhism. (and their opinion on Burma's Rohingya minority. )
70,"Speaking of pagans, Charlemagne had a penchant for massacreing pagans."
71,"Nah. All Nazi's and American confederates are racist, and should have been put to the sword."
72,"This isn't doing that, but nice try. All religions do theses things, not all religious people. Big difference there."
73,I propose a law that all pictures of your cat that are donated to schools in Texas must be displayed.
74,Or predetermined madness.
75,"Oshit, hey y'all it's *schism time*! I love and lobe schisms, at least until they turn violent..."
76,"I need a source, like, right now. I need to see this with my own eyes!"
77,Or historical Tibetan Buddhism or read about  Vajrayana Buddhism and Roman von Ungern-Sternberg.
78,"No, in all honesty I can't say I'm familiar with the group"
79,"Nope, when a pastor, priest, or sacred writings call for violence, genocide, and stripping peoples freedom away, the people that continue to go to that church and give them monetary support are just as guilty and evil. That‚Äôs like saying you support the nazis and you give them money to help them get in power, but you‚Äôre not responsible for them doing what they openly told you they were doing. Jesus said you can tell a tree by its fruit, and the fruit of Christianity is hate and violence no matter how often they talk about peace and love."
80,Where has Quakerism done it? How about Wicca? Unitarianism? Cite specific examples.
81,And prejudices.
82,"Here is Telltale covering a pastor who is advocating for the Trump era to mark the passage of time rather than the birth of Christ. This is a big deal because my childhood fundie church was adamant about using B.C. and A.D. (before Christ, After Death) instead of the secular B.C.E. (before common era). Just one example among many of how Jesus is becoming less of a basis for the far right's doctrine: 

https://youtu.be/MRmzwN5rRWc"
83,"It isn't exactly the same. If your specific church is doing it, then yes. Like the West Batpist church or whatever, Yes, those going there are just as guilty, no doubt. But that doesn't make all Christians guilty. A better example is Nazi's and Germans. Yes, all Nazi's were evil in WW2, but not all Germans were, even normal German soldiers."
84,"Any major religion does it, just because a few more news one haven't yet, doesn't change the reality of the situation, rather you like it or not. Religion is always about spreading. And they do that. But it isn't until they actually get power where they can try to force it in to law. But there isn't a single example of any religion even having any level of power that didn't do it. No one. Just because some religions are too new, or have been so small and not had power, doesn't change this. Nice try though."
85,Or you could just be a bigot and don't like to admit it. People like you are why I'm not an atheist.
86,"No, I just understand reality, and how religion works. Religious people aren't an issue. The vast majority of them don't do the bad shit their religions do, until shit gets really crazy. But there has never been a religion that got big enough, and had actual power that didn't try to force its views on others, not once in the entire history of our species. And there never will be. It is what religion does. It is literally the entire reason it was created in the first place. If you don't want to accept that, then you are just denying reality and are a fucking moron."
87,"Truth has nothing to do with it?  You don't care about reality, you go with the group that's nicer to you?  How's that working out?  I assume you use that standard for all decisions and beliefs, right?"
88,Your inability to express yourself without insulting or cursing out people cements my view of you as a bigot. You're not convincing me.
89,"I'm not convinced of the existence of God one way or the other, and find the claims of certainty by both sides rather laughable."
90,"I don't need to convince you of objective reality. It is fact, doesn't matter what stupid ass stance you want to take with it. Name a single religion that had power and didn't try to force itself in to laws? You can't, because it doesn't exist, and never has, nor ever will. Your willful ignorance doesn't change this pure objective fact.

And you started with the insults calling me a bigot, for literally no reason, so yeah, shows you have no idea what you are talking about, and don't have the intelligence to be part of this. Go sit at the kiddie table, and let the adults talk. This is too over your head Jr."
91,"Sooooooo...
  
Zero self awareness.  Nice."
92,...which makes you an atheist.
93,It's not an insult if it's the truth. You made a bigoted statement and can't handle being called out on it.
94,It makes me an agnostic. Why atheists can't seem to comprehend that distinction is beyond me.
95,"Except I didn't, on any level at all. It isn't my fault you don't understand reality, at all. I wasn't called out on anything. As you are saying yourself, it isn't wrong if true. And what I said is 100% objectively true, you just don't want to accept it, and are showing your willful ignorance with it."
96,"Do you believe that a god exists?  

No) atheist
Yes) theist
  
Are you sure enough that you would say you know?
  
No) agnostic
Yes) gnostic
  
Why people get all shitty and snotty and refuse to understand the words they are using is beyond me."
97,Except the Quakers did hold power in PA during colonial times and didn't force their religion on people. The religious freedom you benefit from is ironically modeled after their government. You really don't know what you're talking about.
