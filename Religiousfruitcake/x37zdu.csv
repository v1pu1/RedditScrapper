1,How Christian of them.
2,"So the all powerful, omniscient, creator of everything, needs some scared little boy to tell him how to run his world?  That’s one way to admit you worship a lie."
3,Conjuring up the holy hitman. Maybe it'd work if you paid him cash like any other murderer-for-hire.
4,What a blight they are.
5,God (apparently): No.
6,"Be careful what you wish for.

7,"r/antitheistcheesecake is all like *""You're only mad 'cause they believe in god""*"
8,These people deserve to be repeatedly sodomized with a red-hot flagpole.
9,"What says “love thy neighbour” more than burning them to the ground? For their own good though, of course"
10,Bring back the lions.
11,"The earth seems to be trying to flood to some degree nowadays. But let me guess... ""that's caused by sin, not God."" >.>"
12,"Seriously, most of these people haven't even probably encountered a gay person. Seeing as how they talk....to god....through the internet, shows how they have no connection with actual people at all."
13,"What children’s pray book it that from, is going to be a best seller. So it needs banned."
14,"I mean, I dunno why people is surprised.

If you read any of the stories of their holy book without the indoctrination, their god is a sadistic monster, lover of slavery, torture and genocide...

What can you expect from the people that have those religions as real facts and never question it?"
15,"They always love bringing up the Old Testament while ignoring Jesus in the New, love thy neighbor. There weren't stipulations on that"
16,"people should be fucking jailed for this shit, how hard is it to just accept someone for who they are instead of having a temper tantrum and whining about it?"
17,"So all things are created by their god and need to be cherished and whatnot, but gay people are the only exception?  

Honestly, I'm curious how they fight that logic.  ""Oh, well being gay is a choice and they chose to be gay even although I didn't choose to be attracted to women"".  

I've had conversations with my creationist coworker and he said he ""doesn't understand"" gay people.  Well, idk what it's like to be gay either, but that isn't a reason to hate something we don't fully understand.  Idk what it's like to be Vietnamese since I'm a whitey, but what reason would I have to dislike Vietnamese people lol.

I would truly like to understand their thought process so maybe we can find the underlying reason behind their bigotry.  My guess is that they're fearful of things they don't entirely understand.  Instead of simply being accepting or curious as most of us are."
18,I'd never do such a thing.
19,"You know those ten plagues of Egypt?

I found the hidden 11th: it's called concealing bigotry. Being a bigot isn't cute, or quirky.  It's just using god and your beliefs as an excuse to be a downright hateful  waste of carbon and air.   So much more useless than worms in dirt and manure."
20,"Funny how that same god -- who supposedly knows all things past, present, and future -- didn't think to create reality in such a way that ""abominations"" and things that bother him could never exist in the first place."
21,Wow what horrible person
22,I would love to see them try. I just hope they'll invoke God when they're getting curbed stomped
23,"He ended it with“amen”, so it’s a loving prayer."
24,hey it's not nice to wish your dad would die  >:/
25,So this person wants to commit suicide by dog?
26,"Ah yes, Love thy neighbour, nothig more loving than drenching than in 300 degrees hot burning sulfur"
27,"If God was real, religion wouldn’t make people like this."
28,I actually laughed out loud at this 😹
29,What shall I wear with sulfur?🤔
30,"This is what christianity is.  This is what they've done for thousands of years.  Everyone knows where almost all LGBT hate comes from, it's religious people.  Always religious people.  

Their god turns gay people into salt.  That's what they're taught to think of gay people.  They should be immediately killed.  Their god said so.  This is not a drill, this is what these people's core belief system is."
31,"Actually, it's *very* Christian of them, if we take the Bible as seriously as they *claim* to."
32,"> How Christian of them.

That was before Christianity. Blame JC father. Wait, his father was also him but he, and by he I mean them, weren't Christian yet."
33,Christian love 🥰🔥
34,"""Why the hell would I?!? They aren't causing any more trouble than average. And certainly a lot less trouble than *you*."""
35,Dipped in jalapeño and lemon juice
36,You think these people read the bible? Lol nah they’re raised by just as bad people in bad churches that conveniently leave that part out. These people keep the hateful stuff and leave out the nice stuff because it doesn’t fit their idea of a Christian Theocratic state
37,"You've never read Revelations, have you? Or Romans? Or any of that other shit Paul wrote? Or all those times Jesus was a vindictive prick who cursed fig trees and called non-Jews ""dogs""?"
38,“No hate like Christian love.” 🥰🔥
39,"Every time I ""salt"" my food I'm getting my gay vitamins? Sweet."
40,"Hate how true this is, I grew up catholic, which isn’t Christianity but like they’re close enough. After getting out I realized how fucked it was, or I suppose that’s why I left religion. Still though, having ✨the gay✨ in a religious town is to me, kinda funny, I like making homophobes mad."
41,Friendly reminder that that story was about hospitality.
42,The Catholics own the copyright to the story of Jesus Christ. The other churches are just stealing it. Make up your own story you thieves.
43,I.E. *too* seriously.
44,Does the salt taste fruitty to you? I know it is for me
45,"> I grew up catholic, which isn’t Christianity 

Are you serious?  

Catholicism was the original Christian church.  The eastern Orthodox church split from Rome in 1054 AD/CE.  Then the Protestant reformation happened in the early 1500s.  They are all branches of Christianity.  

I never imagined I'd hear a Catholic say their faith wasn't part of Christianity.  I can't imagine where you got this idea."
46,"wait catholics arent christians?

i thought to be christian u just had to believe in god

explain pls lol not trying to be rude just curious"
47,Christian's whole Jesus story is borrowed whole cloth...
48,"Yep, the original Catholics turned a Jewish death cult into a full blown religion. They are the reason the Christian bible exists."
49,It tastes Fabbbulllooouuuusssssss! I'm going to sprinkle some on my boyfriends butthole before I tongue fuck him later.
50,"Dude it has been so long, nor do I care."
51,"No, they are.  He's talking out of that hole in his head.  See my post above."
52,"> I'm going to sprinkle some on my boyfriends butthole before I tongue fuck him later.

53,"I mean, I'm an atheist and have been since I was a young teen.  But history matters."
54,"Ah, fuck me sideways, is this a SUB i now have to add to my list?"
