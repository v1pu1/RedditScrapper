1,"They're not wrong, though. Slavery is, in fact, endorsed by god."
2,"Can you imagine a species as evolved as ours can come up with bullshit as dumb as this? 

Like we are literally on top of the animal kingdom, but we still wanna enslave ourselves to some apparently higher power. 

Can you imagine a fucking mouse setting up a trap for itself, and THEN willingly getting trapped?

These people are fucking dumber than mice?"
3,The worst part is the emojis.

6,"When the Bible literally tells you what type of slaves you can take for your own, how you can treat them, where you can buy them from, what you can do to punish them, and how you can psychologically manipulate them into remaining a slave, you have a book not only endorsing slavery, but a book that sets up the idea that nothing in it is remotely moral."

14,">Slavery is, in fact, endorsed by god.

Also by George Washington"
15,I think Orcas have become the top of the animal kingdom. Idiocracy has rendered them far more intelligent than the average human.
16,"How dumb we humans are is arguably proof that a God didnâ€™t create us humans to be the perfect species. Weâ€™re way too dumb to be an omnipotent, omniscient Godâ€™s ideal creation."
17,"Yes, it makes the comment feel like the person actually has slaves"
18,"I mean, fictional characters get capital letters."
19,"God gives his prophets laws on hpw to ""properly"" practice slavery. It was also never condemned or punished by god."
20,"There were rules for both in Leviticus, but I'd have to go look for specific verses."
21,"They don't have.

23,Where it could be inherited?
24,"Do you mean the slave being inherited? Yeah, that occurred, and there were laws for it should happen"
