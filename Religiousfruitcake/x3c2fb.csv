1,"Saudi authoities conclude their investigation.

Girls sentenced to death"
2,Yeah but what did she do? She was probably going to school or driving a car or something
3,"Video:

4,"Came to say something like this. They aren't investigating the wrong doing of the men. They are investigating to see what the girls did to deserve it, or provoke the men in to it, to further punish the girls."
5,Are you being for real?
6,"It wasn't just one girl, in the video you can see them beating multiple girls.
They were on a hunger strike to protest the bad conditions in the orphanage. Because protesting is illegal, these men came to arrest them. Then some other girls started filming so they beat them up too.

Going to school and driving are both legal."
7,"Wanna bet? I mean, death is hyperbole, but how much you're sent to bet the Saudi pigs will end up concluding the girls were doing something bad and so their abuse is justified in some way?"
