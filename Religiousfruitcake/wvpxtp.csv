1,*looks around* Hey all the real christians are gone! It did happen.
2,"Oh, two people who really REALLY want something to be true had dreams about the thing they obsess over? Well, it must be true.

Also, I'm dating Scarlett Johansson. Because same reasoning."

4,I had a dream about Mighty Mouse coming to visit me.  Mighty Mouse is 100% real!
5,"When I was 9 I had a dream about the rapture too. God was my parent's landlord and we all sat around him and he told us we didn't make it this time but to try out next time. Then we had to get in line in order to be killed for Jesus and a large octopus like demon spanked me on the way into the building. 

Definitely got to be real lol."

17,"What if already happened, but the amount of people that disappear was really small compared to 8.000.000.000 ðŸ¤”"
18,"If I could telepathically speak to every christian on earth, I would tell them all that I was god and that they needed to commit suicide to enter heaven. It's called natural selection."
19,I had a dream of an alternative ending to Avengers: Endgame. That must mean that the Avengers are real people!
20,"I'd like to think the dream wasn't even about the rapture, she just had a dream about like, talking marbles or something"

32,I wonder if the ladder will be actually gold and not a cheap harbour freight ladder.
33,I read about the rapture in some book once. It Must be real!
34,Apparently the difference between a having a delusion and no longer having a delusion is how many other people the deluded person can convince to believe in the delusion.
35,There is nothing more I wish was true than the rapture. Because then these people will be just fucking gone already. And I've got dibs on their kitties and chickens.

40,Good on them for having the restraint to not say itâ€™s happening soon.
41,"I used to have nightmares about the rapture as a child. Like. A lot. It terrified me because I was always scared I wasnâ€™t good enough and would get left behind (some wordplay there for anyone else who grew up with that bullshit series). And to make matters worse, anytime
I woke up or came home and was alone in my house I would get this crippling feeling that it had happened and I had missed it. I would have these internal panic attacks as I would try to calmly find someone around me."
42,"This is what a ancient historians did. Except when they did it, it was based af"

44,Yay now we have a more Christlike earth without them.
45,"No, since two people have to have the dream to make it real, *we're* dating Scarlet Johansson"
46,The reason that there is no way I can believe this dream nonsense is because it happens to me all the time. Something would be on my mind for the last day or three and surprise! I get a dream about it.
47,It really depends on who you ask. Joseph Smith got his dream/vision while looking in a hat and started the Mormon church.
48,"Nope, only if your wife dreamed about Mighty Mouse, also. Sorry bro, itâ€™s science."
49,"Just think of all the private jets and mansions this frees up!  Also, the Ark Encounter should make a pretty sweet indoor minigolf course..."

56,Must be true.
57,"Um, I was planning on moving in to the Ark. You're welcome to set up the putt putt golf course on any of the lawns, as I don't do lawns. I'll even give you all the fake animals inside the ark so you can use them as obstacles."
58,"My God, Margaret, do you know what this means! The rapture will be coming any day now!"
59,Oh no. Hell would freeze over before I'm raptured. I go out of my way to guarantee that.
60,Na but I've read Harry Potter and in the Deathly Hallows it sounds like a bitch but even still I think I'd rather be here if the standard printed Christian is gone for good.
