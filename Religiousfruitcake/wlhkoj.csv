1,she looks kind of unhappy
2,Communism is when people aren't christian
3,It’s sad because women don’t want to be seen as just someone that carries a baby
4,Communist?  What?
5,"This is fucked up, but i’ve never heard someone say “birthing person”. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
6,"I wonder how many times the bible says ""shall be put to death"""
7,"Honestly, that looks like an exhausted mother who doesn’t get any help from her partner.  I really, really feel bad for that lady."
8,"LOL ""communist word"""
9,"“Hmmm…’birthing person’ yup that will make these mother real ugly, that’ll show them”"
10,Tell him to go fuck his birthing person.
11,"Not to advertise communists. Having lived in communist country I know all about its flaws however it was the communists that gave women rights in my part of the world. From right to vote, to right to choose career on equal footing as men, gender equality in salaries and perhaps most importantly single mothers were not target of prejudiced society anymore. What can we say about the christians in this respect?"
12,"Honestly, while I don’t agree with the religious spin on this, I do find the term “birthing person” to be kind of cringy. It just sounds clunky and awkward, like calling a driver an “automobile control operator” - it’s not *incorrect*, as that is (from a definition standpoint) what they are… but it just sounds weird, doesn’t it?"
13,Mother was never used in the holy bible because the bible was originally not English
14,Communist is just a word Americans throw at things they don’t like at this point
15,Inheritance doesn't need a sad component
16,"“Communist”


They use that word like it’s a bogeyman, with no attempt to understand what it really means."
17,"By the same logic, the book contains an instruction on how to perform an abortion, so stop with the fucking interference!"
18,"Who the fuck cares what the Bible says? It also has a lot of rape, murder, and genocide. That being said I do think the term “birthing person” sounds clunky and stupid."
19,"Birthing person, is that all I have to say to offend people now?"
20,Anything that's bad = communism apparently
21,"Why do they act as if everyone gave a fuck about what the bible says? Do they not realize that there are other religions, and atheists exist?"
22,"I mean, birthing person does sound stupid, unrelated to either bible or communism or whatever else."
23,Wut?
24,"Why is ""to"" written as ""t0"" tho. With a zero instead of an o lolz"
25,Thats the face of post partum depression
26,"Mother— a word used in Mein Kampf/ Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung many many times

Birthing Person: not found in any of those books"
27,McCarthyism is alive and well
28,I love how Americans born before 1980 are still not giving up on the red scare
29,Never heard that term in my life.
30,"I would love to hear these people define what communism is. I'm sure they don't actually know, other than ""things I don't agree with"""
31,"""Birthing person"" is a really poor choice of phrase, though, as it effectively reduces women to their reproductive capabilities. It honestly sounds like something you'd hear in the villains' dialogue in a misogynist dystopia like *The Handmaid's Tale.*"
32,Breeders. Get it right.
33,I wonder how many times the bible says “person” or “birth”
34,"Holy straw man, Batman"
35,"If you don’t like it, it’s communism"
36,Nice. I hate it.
37,First time in my life I've heard anyone use 'birthing person' lol.
38,I want a poster of this on my wall it's just gold
39,Do they know what communism is?
40,"I agree ""birthing person"" doesn't sound very elegant, but this term is only necessary since Christian culture has repressed trans identities for centuries, which results in the English language not having any distinction between gender identity and genitalia."
41,I would prefer mother.
42,"But he’s right, burthing person is just shitty"
43,Ugh I hate communists but I hate fundamentalists and fruitcakes more
44,Mothers are wonderful.
45,No thanks to either.
46,she should have kept her legs together if she didn't want that leach
47,Based Dad
48,Birthing person is a stupid thing to call someone.
49,Child free sounds far better to me
50,Being a mother is hard... even just carrying and birth the tiny person let alone caring for them.
51,She looks exhausted. Someone take that baby for a couple of hours so she can get a nap in.
52,She cooked that child for 9 months she probably wants to sleep😭
53,Makes sense...
54,Or when they dare to disagree with them.
55,Or anyone against america
56,"Very true, I heard Bin Laden and the Dalai Lama were both commies."
57,I'm not Christian and I hate communism.
58,"Well, I'm a communist and I'm very much not a Christian ... Coincidence?"
59,6 billion communists? wow
60,Communism is when women want to be anything other than walking incubators
61,A couple of family members voiced the same opinion about it. They feel the term “Birthing person” reduced them to a human incubator
62,"Yes indeed, the term ""birthing person"" appears 648 times in ""Das Kapital""."
63,Didn’t a GOP congressman call women “earthen vessels”?
64,"Because it's a legal / formal term, more than a term for use in conversation. Just like I rarely greet my students' parents with ""Aah, you must be X's legal guardian or caretaker!"", even though that's exactly what they are in the school paperwork."
65,"Yeah it's not used. More often ""people who give birth"" or ""pregnant person"" are used. I think one legislator said birthing person one time and every conservative Christian clutched their pearls and started screaming about the woke libs."
66,"Here in Canada we've had ""owner of a penis"" and ""owner of a uterus"" used by a women's rights defense group...


Everything is possible..."
67,"I have, and it was extremely cringey.

The person who made that Facebook post is still a fruitcake, of course."
68,Well there are 35 or 36 capital offenses depending on which brand of Christianity you subscribe to. But then there are all the times god commanded his people to commit genocide. Then there was that whole flood narrative where god killed every living creature on earth. So I dont know how to measure that. A lot? Wayyyyy too many?
69,Oh my word you're right! Hahaha.
70,“Communist word” like it’s not even one word lol
71,I don't speak to him. I just needed other people who would feel disgusted to witness the transphobic assholery with me.
72,"Oh it's only used in VERY specific settings. And as much as I don't like it, it exists for inclusive legal reasons. No one is using that term in normal life."
73,been that way since the 50's
74,"If you look at it critically there’s absolutely no reason to care about the Bible at all. If it were true it’s a terrible, terrible story. 

That being said! I have greatly enjoyed the times when I had the chance to quote the verses from Kings about bashing infants’ heads against rocks and slicing open pregnant bellies when a Christian tries to tell me that the Bible forbids abortion."
75,They are suffering under a self delusion that the United States is a Christian nation.
76,"It may sound stilted and weird, but it actually has a purpose.   


It's like that old George Carlin sketch where he makes fun of airlines for saying ""person in need of boarding assistance"" (or some other similar convoluted phrase) instead of ""cripple"". To paraphrase Contrapoints' commentary - yes, it sounds funny, because it's a turn of phrase that you would never use in everyday speech (in 2022, you would probably say ""disabled person"" rather than ""cripple"", but you certainly wouldn't say ""person in need of assistance""). But an airline form is not everyday speech, and they need to use blanket terms that will cover most possible circumstances, just like in a legal document. A ""person in need of boarding assistance"" will, in most cases, be a disabled person in a wheelchair for ex - but it could also be someone with a broken leg, or someone's who's pregnant, or someone's who's just really old and fragile. ""Person in need of boarding assistance"" covers all of that.  


Ditto ""birthing person"". Not every person giving birth is a woman (not just in terms of self-identification - sometimes the person will literally have a government-issued ID that says ""M"" on it), so it makes sense to have a broader term."
77,I feel like birth parent would sound better. And maybe be received better?
78,If I had to guess.... because boomer?
79,NEVER GIVE UP.
80,"It's the ""Latinx"" of motherhood."
81,No. Not even a little bit.
82,Nobody uses that in a serious way
83,Conservative straw man talking point are always shitty
84,Actually I take that back
85,Not to mention having to deal with this bible-thumper jerking off to her when she's just trying to breastfeed.
86,I think you mean *birthing person*
87,Impossible! /s
88,"Unrelated, but my partner once jokingly said, ""Carl Sagan's last name is one letter away from Satan and one letter away from Pagan... coincidence or divine?"" And I laughed so hard, I turned it into a shirt design. Lol."
89,"Didn’t you know that the Soviets called their country, “Birthing Person Russia” and were defending the “Birthing Person Land” in WW2?"
90,Yes.
91,"Isn't that a Mormon thing or rather, saying?"
92,"The Fox News pattern. Step 1: Look for some, very outside the mainstream term or event on the left. Step 2: Greatly exaggerate how common or widely supported it is. Step 3: Use it to smear the entire left. Step 4: Have Fox News hosts hyperventilate while enraging their viewers about this being supposedly being supported by ""The Left""."
93,"Honestly, she doesn’t look like she’d care if you called her a “birthing person” or whatever.  As long as she can get some sleep & maybe a shower, I don’t think she’d give a shit.  Especially if she just had a c-section."
94,"The word mother was never used in the Bible

As it came from old English, lol"
95,"I heartily understand that need. And that picture is really stupid, and I also am tired of those things going around."
96,"The Bible is as bizarre as you’d expect from an anthology by hundreds of authors whose lifespans were spread over centuries, that lived in different places, had different goals and were vastly different people altogether. And their writings were never meant to be read as literally factual accounts of events, even where historical events are described. Ancient people had no concept of accurate factual history writing. It just didn’t exist back then. They would mix facts with myths liberally and their readers would not only know but expect it, because the *meaning* of it all mattered more to them than the strict facts. 
Hence the Bible contains bizarre, wildly implausible, absurd and violent, revolting and horrific stories like the one you mentioned. 

However, I disagree with you that there is no reason at all to care about the Bible. For one, among all that trash, it also contains passages of great beauty, wisdom and literary value. And secondly, the Bible had a tremendous influence on literate, art, movies, plays and general concepts of our culture. You cannot fully understand and appreciate a major portion of Western art (some of the greatest works among them) without being familiar with at least the most important Biblical ideas. Lots of allusions, parallels and subtext — a whole dimension of depth — will escape you if you’re not familiar with it. You can’t understand a good portion of the cultures of European countries, the Americas, Russia and also some others without at least basic knowledge about Biblical concepts. And again, knowing the Bible better will often provide more in-depth understanding. The same goes for Muslim countries and the Quran. We shouldn’t be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Just not taking ancient literature for more than it is: highly culturally relevant and influential literature, no more, but also no less."
97,This is just a little off. My wife works for the department of literacy for a major us city and there is a little more going on when you say person in need of boarding assistance versus disabled person. From what she tells me there is a large push at least in public education to use people first language. Part of this is because of the way english grammar is so saying disabled person makes there disability seem like a defining characteristic. You are right I suppose it isn't always used in everyday language but one might be surprised how often saying something like that is a total faux pas in professional settings. At least in the professions dealing with people outside what is considered normal.
98,"Or just ""mother""."
99,L
100,nobody I‘ve ever heard ever uses *Birthing Person* in a serious situation
