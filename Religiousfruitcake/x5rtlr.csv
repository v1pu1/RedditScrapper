1,"It’s self control. He should ask himself how weak he is, if he can only follow his religions laws when the whole society is built around making it easy for him."
2,"Wow imagine being so sexualy suppressed that you can't deal with women not covered head to toe. 

Also random boners can happen. It's pretty common."
3,"Wtf does ""control myself"" mean? I'm hoping he just means his erection and not his actions"
4,At least he's looking inward instead of blaming everyone else the problem. It's more complicated than that obviously but it's a step away from a dangerous road
5,Quora*
6,"If that's really the case, they need to see a professional."
7,Removing eye balls is a pretty effective way to not get erection everytime you see women. 🤷‍♂️
8,At least he’s wanting to control himself instead of the women he’s referring to. Baby steps.
9,"I think it’s easy to call this person a perv, but when he may have only been exposed to women covered up and all of a sudden they’re not, I can imagine it being quite a culture shock. Especially with the way modesty ties into sex in Islam, I can assume this isn’t uncommon and probably takes a while to adjust to


That being said, he needs to adjust, quick. You cant be out here getting hard over cleavage, and suddenly losing self control when you see some thighs"
10,Someone get a tag on this trainee rapist.
11,I honestly feel for the guy. He’s been raised his entire life to think a shirt and pants is sexy.
12,I can't imagine any grown man having to ask this question.  Does he not see what a degenerate thing he is?  Does he not see that he's telling the world he's scum?
13,Am I reading this wrong? He seems to be asking for advice on how to fix HIS problem but all the comments here are making it seem like he’s asking how to fix the women or something. Bad self control is a problem but at least he seems to acknowledge it’s his problem.
14,"To give him the benefit of the doubt, he is at least asking how to control his own erections. He isn’t blaming women for dressing like that and he’s just unused to it."
15,"Step 1: Remind yourself that the woman near you is a person, not just an object of your desire.

Step 2: Treat all people with respect.

That’s it. Pretty simple."
16,"You stay at home and don't walk around unsupervised if you have to go out in public. Basically the same rules men in Muslim countries place on women. And if women can do it, then so can he."
17,"I find myself attracted to some women depending on their outfits, but I've never once thought about raping them."
18,"Matthew 18:9. 

“Gouge your eyes out”"
19,"Pakistani office:

""are you looking at NSFW images again Jamal?""

*Has picture of human ankles on his desktop*"
20,"I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion, but I think it is conditioning and what you are used to. Spend enough time getting used to women dressing like that, and you won't continue to have that ""reaction.""

If you look at what was considered ""normal"" throughout history in different regions, this has varied widely. It seems like he is experiencing some culture shock. 

The goal of a society, though, is to allow adults to dress any damn way they please. Should people be allowed to just walk around naked? Probably not, so I'm not sure where that line should be drawn. 

I do know that that line isn't anywhere near what is found in Muslim theocracies though."
21,Just *be norma*l.
22,Honestly the first guy seems pretty alright considering this is something he’s been taught id alright and he’s actually asking for how to control himself
23,"If it wasn’t already obvious, this is very fake. Quora encourages rage bait questions that drive engagement through their incentive program"
24,"The President: \[to Morty\] My God, man, we were all fourteen once, but it's called self-control!"
25,"""how can I control myself"" is a much better question to ask than ""how can I control them"""
26,"I mean, from what is usually seen, he's asking how to control himself, because of the comfort of covered-up women for him, better than them honestly complaining about it, sounds like he's more understanding of different customs at least."
27,This has got to be a troll or perv. Why else would you go on quora and talk about your boner problems.
28,"You're either a good Muslim, or a good human. There is no in-between."
29,"i saw a  muslim woman at the athletics track, with a nike hijab...... and skin tight running pants !  whats the point of that ?!"
30,Clearly fake
31,Question and answer illustrate two different kinds of fruitcakes
32,"That’s Quora, not reddit"
33,"1. it's in quora
2. it's clearly fake, Muslims know very well how westerners dress, they don't have to move to the west to find out"
34,"I went to India for 3 week and about a week in I realised I've not seen any sexual advertising. I generally didn't feel aroused in public, not aroused, but my brain just didn't pick up on any lingerie legs or twerking pics etc. Coming back to the UK my brain switched back on as there was just hot women in adverts and sexy lips and lipsticks and women in bras on the TV in the airport. 

I didn't change, but my brain just acknowledged this and then I carried on as normal. It's not like I was going to act differently because of this. I can control my emotions and respect what others do and show. I enjoyed the fact that males and females have their freedom to show a bit of their ass in short shorts, men and women. Anyone telling others to cover up is scared of their own actions and lack of controls, and thoughts, get over yourself."
35,"Somebody should tell him to wear 6 layers of constricting pants, and a full helmet with a visor that makes him blind.

That way, he won't be able to see the women or be tempted to get an erection."
36,At least he's looking at how to control himself instead of how to control women 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️. It's a step in the right direction I guess.
37,Dude…that’s fcking disgusting.
38,Tell him to fuck off to his country
39,My man’s getting a boner from looking at female hands
40,"He could always cut his dick off, since it is his problem, not the women's, that he can't control himself."
41,I understand the concept of culture shock. But regularly getting boners? Come on man!
42,He should play drink the stuff under the sink.
43,"It's Quora. People intentionally post troll questions on here in order to get attention. Quora has some sort of bullshit affiliate payment scheme where the most annoying and douchey posts make bank. While yes, there are Muslims with attitudes like this, I don't think it's fair to judge them based on Quora posts. There are more than enough horrifying real stories in the news to provide plenty of criticism."
44,This has got nothing to do with religion. Poor adolescent is just having a culture shock. He will be alright in few months
45,"Go to a doctor to help you handle your objectification of women and unrestrained horniness. The fact you can't control your dick isn't other people's problem at least you kind of recognize it. Big thing is to not see women and their bodies as inherently sexual. That's just a person in clothes, my guy"
46,At least he seems to be trying
47,"This is irrelevant to the main point. But holy mother of god,someone typed 'wear a hijab' for once instead of 'wear hijab'. Everytime I hear them brought up, it always annoys me how people seemingly only say or type it without an a before hijab."
48,He should get some self control and get used to it. It's non of his business what other people wear.
49,"I don't understand these people. 

""I get erections when I see women's arms/legs, it must be their fault so I must shame/kill/hurt them""

How about leave them the fuck alone you creeps."
50,That’s clearly Quora??
51,Try growing up.
52,"For once that foreigner tries to adapt to our culture and realizes that he got a problem, but yet the majority craps on him. No wonder the rest of the world hates us."
53,Have you tried fucking them? I'm pretty confident you can figure out a way to redefine a one-night-stand as a temporary form of jihad and the girl you're involved with as war-booty that you set free again the morning after.
54,"The lack of restraint is unbelievable.
Never would I have thought of this being an issue. 
Some dudes really need to wack it more."
55,That’s Quora
56,Satire
57,Dick cage get one /jk
58,Always wanted an underwater house
59,"Go home, take off your pants and jacket."
60,"""Hahaha"""
61,Isn't that what elastic waistbands are for?
62,I’ve heard that Europe has a problem with Middle Eastern men who immigrate or come in on visas sexually assaulting women because they’re not used to having to be responsible for themselves.
63,He doesn't know what self-control is at all and it shows
64,"Simple fix, get erectile disfunction"
65,Punch yourself repeatedly in your crotch until your erection goes away. You’re welcome.
66,Yeah they wear scuba suits now
67,People taking Quora questions serious is funny as hell
68,That’s not Reddit
69,This is posted on Quora…
70,Troll? Troll.
71,🔪
72,lets invite him to a weekend at a good and old nudist beach in east germany.
73,"I am going to play devil's advocate and say that I think he is essentially meaning how can he not get random erections.

I think it goes away in time. When I got in my 30's the random kickstand went away on it's own."
74,That’s easy. Get testosterone blocking meds and it will be a lot harder to achieve an erection. Source: I have low testosterone.
75,"I honestly don't know if they would follow the advice of Jesus, but he did say to pluck out your eyes if they cause you to falter, after all it is better for you to get into heaven without an eye than to be out of the heaven with your eyes intact."
76,He must change the western culture rather than going back. Vile pos.
77,thank god he's not bi
78,"This is kinda normal isn’t it? Most of us get this random-Boner stage alongside puberty in middle school/high school. It’s make sense that someone from a very repressed culture would have this experience no? Or do I completely not know how the body works.

The difference is we don’t blame the women for it."
79,Come onn! This cannot be not satire/sarcasm! Right? Right??
80,"i may get an erection if i see a sexy woman too, but that doesn’t mean i’m going to rape her. hell, my penis gets erect for strange unknown reasons all the time. there was a time when i was a kid and i was as erect as the eiffel tower every morning. slapping the bastard wouldn’t help either. 

you get erect? can’t control yourself? go jerk off. forbidden in your religion? quit it.

fucking fruit cakes."
81,"Men in countries that don’t respect women have zero self control. They’ve never needed it. It’s on the woman to take care of mens self-control for them, and it’s also their fault if they dress too revealing and get raped. 

Men having sexual self-control isn’t even a conversation over there yet."
82,"Also, porn.

Surprisingly, people who aren't sexually repressed don't get a boner when they see someone's ankle. Hell, I'd wager most American men don't even get a chubby if a movie has a full nude shot."
83,"""Self-control"" is such a weird term when people talk about men forcing themselves on women. Like, we wish they had more self-control. However, if it is really about self-control, there is a presupposition here, that men always need to control themselves in order to not sexually assault women. However, one can just not want to, at any time in his life, to assault anybody. I wish people were taught this instead of self-control, philosophically speaking."
84,"I dunno, it sounds more like naive innocence of something he's not used to. 

I'd imagine it would be similar if a semi-conservative dude from the west suddenly went to an island of beautiful naked Amazonian women everywhere.

Or a 13-year-old going to a beach for the first time and everyone is bikinis.

The reply is kinda mean, they just assume the worst.

Real advice would be to just remember that it's normal. That eventually you'll get used to it and not overthink it. People can get used to new realities pretty fast."
85,That’s what he’s doing. He’s asking how to stop he’s not saying women should cover themselves.
86,"It's because he's always seen women with half a closet draped over, that when he sees a knee, or an elbow, they are ""revealing themselves"" so let alone a pair of short shorts with a short top. In other words, where we see normal clothing, you see revealing themselves. That's just sick on your side, and if you wouldn't of grown up where women have to cover themselves with there curtains, you would find it normal too and not give it a second thought. (just a second glance, as being a healthy man)"
87,Absolutely. This guy's fucking pathetic.
88,">Wow imagine being so sexualy suppressed that you can't deal with women not covered head to toe. 

And to think the fundies in the U.S. (and elsewhere) want to bring and enforce their version of it here while simultaneously fearing it coming from another culture and religion. 

They ought to take note what they're getting themselves into and be careful what they pray for."
89,bruh i get random boners at 40 and i got ED. like wtf. bodies are weird sometimes.
90,"Honestly, as bad as this whole post is, it gives me a shiny bit of hope that he's asking how he can control *himself*, not the women around him.

I try to be as empathetic as possible when it comes to people I don't know, and I can imagine this guy was brought up in an Islamic country where he has only ever seen a woman's skin a few times. Being able to see us uncovered must be a huge change for him, and his body reacts to it as well, but I think he's trying to adapt.

Idk, maybe I'm just too sympathetic."
91,I’m just glad he’s asking how to control himself rather than how to control the women
92,"""Allah verga!"""
93,"yeah lol, my bad"
94,Happy cake day BrickmanBrown!
95,happy cake day!
96,Happy cake day!
97,Or just balls
98,Modest dress just increases sexual tension imo. Makes my body a forbidden treat. Doesnt protect me in the slightest
99,Modesty culture always drags about the best hypocrite out of people
100,Ankle bracelet
