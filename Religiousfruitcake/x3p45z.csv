1,Nicely played gawd.  Nicely played.
2,So he must be a homosexual?
3,I guess he‚Äôs still in the closet
4,"I mean, cool god, but couldn't you have made sure he was IN the house first? Smh, can't do anything right."
5,"I don't know which way to take it is funnier:

a). He was right AND gay.

b). God sees this and goes ""No, I fucking don't! In fact fuck you, flood!"""
6,"It‚Äôs entirely possible he‚Äôs gay, a shocking amount of these people are."
7,"‚ÄúBut I said, ‚ÄòNo homo!‚Äô‚Äú"
8,A means of God expressing his love to him.
9,"Poor Pakistan, so many homosexuals there."
10,I wanna hear his explanation
11,God pulled the uno reverse..
12,Karmatic justice in my opinion.  Serves him right for being a hateful nasty person.
13,"Nono, religolos have an explanation for everything.

&#x200B;

His house getting flooded is not by god because he is gay, it's because he's a good guy. It was the devil's work - so we should all transfer money to him now."
14,Funny how the Christian god always seems to cause so many natural disasters in the Bible Belt.
15,"My my, how the tables have turned"
16,GG
17,Amen
18,I wonder what his excuse for this is
19,Tony Perkins as‚Ä¶Psycho
20,"‚ÄúI told you!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUghh, nevermind‚Äù"
21,Ok I believe again now.
22,"Gosh, I guess God don‚Äôt like ulgy"
23,"Anybody wants to bet that he‚Äôs a closeted homosexual, who has been so indoctrinated to hate himself that he spews hate at others?"
24,God be like: ‚Äûhah you gay‚Äú
25,What a loser. I hope he gets his dick blown off by a bottle rocket
26,"Tony Perkins is a closeted gay man, but because he's a preacher he's got to hide it."
27,"IM FEELING SKINNY, TONY"
28,He just floated right out of the closet
29,Hmmm‚Ä¶.  Maybe God‚Äôs punishing him‚Ä¶.
30,"It's not about the punishment, it's about sending a message"
31,mmmm me thinks this is god telling him to knock off his Bullshit
32,"God works quickly these days, punishing the wicked...
 
Edit: punishing, not penetrating. What an unfortunate autocorrect."
33,I‚Äôm sorry but if you pray to gawd instead of jod you go to heck
34,They would just say it's because others in the area were gay or something.
35,"Strange how gay people turn out to be all in the same areas that happen to be low lying areas. Like for example, the whole ocean facing side of Houston is gay, and most of the lower part of New Orleans is gay."
36,He sure isn‚Äôt a supporter..
37,I don't think he has a closet to be in anymore.
38,He‚Äôs going to need to dry out the closet
39,"""Words professed with thine mouth alone mean nothing, little man."""
40,"They do have a *huge* problem with raping little boys, actually.

I'm not just talking ""there are pedophiles over there.""

I'm talking like ""pedophilia is a fucking widespread and pretty much normalized cultural thing over there."" 

Women are basicaly allowed zero social life, no dating, etc. So men often compensate by doing those things, and all the other stuff, with kids, which it isn't ""gay"" since they aren't adults yet. 

So yeah, that probably ruined your day.

Though by this guy's logic, God might apparently said, ""Y'all are fucking disgusting and evil. Flood."" So I guess there's a silver lining."
41,God is testing him.
42,God thinks he wasn‚Äôt homophobic enough!
43,He's too gay.
44,It's like they're disgusting to Him.
45,Someone uses that term alot üòè
46,"My country is really boring when it comes to having natural disasters, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are gayless. Except sometimes when gay means happy we can be a bit gayless, I guess, but that‚Äôs mainly the dark winters, I think."
47,"Islands in the Pacific, slowly becoming gay, inches by inches... (hmmm.... an unfortunate choice of measurement...)"
48,Florida is extremely gay!
49,Global warming will be a period of great awakening!
50,Maybe a water closet‚Ä¶
51,It‚Äôs even fucking worse once you get to know what ‚Äúbacha bazi‚Äù is
52,It's God's will.
53,Finnland ?
54,"Yeah, that‚Äôs the one"
