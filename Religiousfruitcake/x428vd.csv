3,"...the fuck is ""Air Therapy""?"
4,Of course Dungeons and Dragons is on there.  Yet Pathfinder is apparently okay!
5,![gif](giphy|dL5qLAlhMn3va)
6,"Comics.  Sure, tell me you don’t understand them by just throwing a whole medium in the demonic category because of some common elements.  There are actual comics of all genres including one that’s just Genesis."
7,Just so inherently racist. The list could just be “any cultural practice not initially adopted or stolen by white people”
8,Acupressure is just a massage with more pressure than normal.
9,"Healing without prayer? As in, cellular regeneration?"
10,Acupuncture has made my nerve disorder so much less painful that I no longer want to kill myself. I'd like to see these assholes go through what I have and see what praying to gawd will accomplish.
11,Of course anything that has to do with any culture they deem too different from them
12,"I went to a southern-baptist run school for a while and there was an informal list like this. Not part of the official school rules, but people were on the alert for anything ""satanic"" all the time. Looking through the link that OP posted I kept nodding and thinking, Yeah, that one, oh hey forgot about that, yep ..."
13,Surprised they didn't just have 'fun' or 'smiling' as being evil
14,must be an exhausting life to be afraid of so many things...
15,"I read through the entire thing, whoever follows this will literally have nothing left."
16,"Everything except their brand of fundamentalist Christianity in other words. 

Meh, chances are even they would be too liberal for another sect, preacher or internet ministry. 

The list never ever ends I tell you. But its not surprising when it originates from a belief of humans being inherently evil from the onset. Soon it'll be air breathing, walking and talking to someone."
17,Did they just copy/paste the Websters dictionary?
18,You say “cursed” I say “blessed”
19,Well I agree with clowns 🤷‍♀️.
20,What if one is addicted to church? Or their god? Damned forever!

22,I didn’t even get down far the list but Care Bears and applied kinesiology so physical therapy is somehow evil this person writing this on a auto typing machine known as a keyboard is committing a sin by typing it out also apparently autocorrect is evil which considering how often I get duck is accurate.

24,No death magic!? Darn it! My plans for this weekend are ruined!
25,"“truth” in “reality” dot com, everybody…"

56,"Care Bears, positive mental attitude, and Jesus all make the list"
57,"“Cursed objects provide what are effectively demonic doorways or portals, giving demons access and licence grounds to operate in all the ways subtly and otherwise that they do”

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

So sad that people believe this kind of nonsense."
58,Read the comments - holy cow!
59,Their patron saint C.S. Lewis’ book the “Chronicles of Narnia” is also on a that list! Eating their own!! Good times.
60,To be fair 8-Ball and Hats are on there.  Oh we got trouble!
61,"Breathing. If you suck in air with your lungs, that's a sin and you're going to hell."

77,*Boku no Pico intensifies*
78,"I attended an interfaith school partly run by Christians. The Christian group wasn’t extremist but they kind of have a stereotype around guilt, which my fundie mother took too far.

Fundies from other denominations told me some very hateful things about them, the most ridiculous one being “they have more holidays than other denominations because they made them up as an excuse to be lazy and get drunk.”"
79,"If that is what sends me to hell, I think I'm doing good. Lol"
80,"I know you're making a joke, but this is literally the logic."
