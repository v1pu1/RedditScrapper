1,Those crazy people just don't need proof for anything. They just made up some bullshit and treat it as truth
2,"> a lot of people have died from disrespecting God

As in they've been killed by psycho humans. Other than that no one has died from disrespecting God."
3,I don’t know why but to me this gives off serious “My dad could beat your dad in a fight” energy. Idk why.
4,"Yeah, never mind that ""God is love"" stuff, my god will kill you if you don't give him the respect I think he deserves!  /s"
5,DONT THINK JUST ACCEPT - Religion
6,r/confidentlyincorrect
7,"God is a useless piece of shit, it doesn't exist, and if he exist it's too dumb and weak to even break one of my hair"
8,Alot of people have died for trying to even not disrespect god and just being told they do because of different beliefs or traditions.
9,"They never specify which god, out of the thousands, they only ever say generalized “God.”"
10,Sergio is saying he's full of shit. Christian TikTok indeed.
11,"Mantological argument: by chance guess work, self fulfillment, & happenstance must mean god gave them spoilers of what was to come! Case closed!"
12,They can’t even establish the existence of gods.
13,Those who disrespect (their) god are the ones who call themselves Christian or Jewish or Muslim and then act like a horse's ass towards everyone else.
14,You just described religion in a nutshell.
15,"That's why I've come to the conclusion it's pointless to argue with religious people, they'll make something up and then act like they've checkmated you lol"
16,Came to say this. God has never killed anyone for disrespecting him. Hard to do that when you aren't real. But the crazies that made him up have always loved killing those who won't fall in line. Big reason religion was created was to control people.
17,Nope it seem that i'm still alive
18,Yup
