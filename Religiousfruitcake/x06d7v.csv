1,"I call Shia garbage because he's a woman beater who knowingly gives them STDs.  
I say his acting is garbage because he used his regular way of speaking to play this Italian monk, so he's walking around in the film as the only American-sounding person in Italy. He said in an interview that he was feeling a personal religious experience during the filming so he didn't want to ""mask"" that with an accent. In other words, instead of playing the part of the person he was portraying, he made it about himself.  
Catholics are trying to make a big deal out of him right now because during the filming he converted to Catholicism. They can absolutely have him. Shia calls himself a method actor. In 2014 when he played the role of a devout Christian, he publicly converted from Judaism to Christianity. In 2020 in order to prepare to play the role of a murderer, he bragged to people that he drove around Hollywood and shot stray dogs. His weak mind is putty. He's all yours."
2,"if I had a dollar for every moron that calls Nazis ""communist"""
3,"Playing devil's advocate here, he protected Nazi weapons so his town wouldn't get bombed. 

Not saying he should have done it but he certainly didn't *like* Nazis."
4,"Wasn't there a Padre Pio that supposedly had stigmata for like decades? 

I mean, I don't believe that shit, but I heard that legend once before. Same guy?"
5,Wasnt he the guy who pierced his hands and claimed God did it or something?
6,Shia is an excellent actor even though he’s a bad dude.
7,"Actual Wife Beater Shia LaBeouf
Actual Sex Offender Shia LaBeouf
Now Actual Nazi Shia LaBeouf

I wouldn't be surprised if he DID turn out to kill for sport and eat the bodies."
8,"Lies about another Saint .Sancta Theresa and Sancta Iohanna Arciensis were not enough , apparently .Die mad ."
9,He shot FUCKING WHAT
10,"I mean, of course he converted to Catholicism. That gave him the chance to be Actual (According to Catholic doctrine, anyway) Cannibal Shia Lebeouf, although if he's shooting stray dogs, he might be using it more as an excuse."
11,I thing the point here is something something communist judeo-bolsheviks created the nazis and manipulated the Germans so that they could get Israel (???)
12,Why's he a bad dude?
13,"He’s done some messed up stuff. If your interested you could just type in Shia Drama on google.

He’s a great actor though"
