1,Where are naked adults dancing in front of children? What's that a reference to?
2,"They are referring to the public high school coach who was praying after football games and making students feel like they needed to participate if they wanted to play.  And they are right, that does piss me off."
3,When you're okay with [thing that didn't happen] but against [thing that did happen] you just must be on the side of evil.
4,"Um...but adults praying to God are also getting naked in front of children...and worse, they are using praying to God to get children naked. Catholics, SBC, Mormons, Anglicans, JWs...all of them."
5,"…and who is “okay” with naked strangers dancing for children? 

Or is she confusing that with half-naked strangers nailed to crosses?"
6,If you're not angry over (made up scenario that no significant group of people would approve of if it was happening) but not angry over (thing that almost everyone is fine with) then you're evil (in my total strawman situation I made up)
7,"A right wing Christian ""done pretending,""  I seriously doubt that."
8,"People who want to pray doing their prayers ain't a problem.

Forcing other people to pray is a problem.

Enacting laws based on hatred is a problem.

Taking away people's rights because they disagree with your beliefs is a problem."
9,Where are there naked strangers dancing for children???
10,If some dude wants to dress up in a dress to have a good time and be nice to my kid then a predator who goes by “youth pastor” preying on children.. i dont see the downside to drag
11,"A while ago I saw a video of a drag Queen performing at a restaurant (idk what it’s called but it was in America and was clearly advertised that adult performance was going to happen). The Drag Queen wore fake huge tits that bounced insanely around (looked quite funny) but suddenly she shudders as she walks past a table while gently hiding her Hoo-has and not swinging them for shows. because *whom ever assigns guests their table* forgot to tell a family with like two preteens that there was going to be a non-child friendly show so please find some other place to sit.

So yea, there’s been ONE accidental occurrence of kids being front row of a almost fully naked drag Queen show (*but not at a official drag race btw, and my European impression is that Americans love Hooters and urging little boys to be ogling women’s breast like a rite of passage*), yet said Queen did whatever she could to shield her nudity a bit and get past said family asap, as of course she didn’t wanna swing her large fake fits in a child’s face. I don’t remember all details but I recall the family *not* being outraged and the kids being given money (by their parents I suppose) to give to the Queen, just like other guests had done aka their parents supported it (but I might misremember that detail)."
12,">
naked adults dancing in front of children
>
  
I assume she meant *priests*"
13,shes probably talking about the school football coach who was taken to court because he forced his players to pray at a public school. the reason i think shes talking about this story because it was one of the latest story about people praying on government property
14,Christians imagine a lot of persecution. I just don’t see it.
15,I mean I'm not angry at them praying I just wish they'd fuck off
16,Naked… strangers… dancing… In front of… children? Bruh how can she say something so weird as if everyone just knows what the fuck she’s on about? Does she thinks there’s an 18- strip club? Where strangers dance for the Boss Baby?
17,"My cataract surgeon asked me if I minded if he said a prayer before my surgery. What was I gonna say, yes I mind? Dude is about to laser my eyeball."
18,I'm equally not ok with priests and pastures dancing naked in front of kids either...
19,When you have no argument so you start making shit up
20,"So then no one is evil, according to her."
21,Are the naked strangers in the room with us right now?
22,"These are the same people who get irrationally angry when viewing any person practicing any other religion. Could be judaism, islam, paganism, literally anything."
23,There's no way she pulled a word like apoplectic out of her own vocabulary... It's also almost guaranteed that 99% of her followers read it as apocalyptic.
24,"Good fucking Christ people. I wish they’d get through their thick fucking skulls: We don’t care that you pray or are religious, we just want you to stop pushing that belief on others. And stop using it to justify your own bad behavior."
25,Imaginary adults. Adults take their imaginary friends very seriously.
26,What is this naked strangers shite? Is she referring to drag? Why did this all of a sudden become a thing? When I was a kid literally every pantomime or kids play I when to had to have an obligatory dude dressed as a woman who would interact with the kids with the whole “oh no he didn’t” “it’s behind you” thing. That person was always the most popular character and parents loved him/her?
27,What naked strangers dance for children? What is she going on about?
28,"That’s cute, we’ll see if you feel that way when those adults are praying to Allah or Buddha.

But yeah sexualizing children is very wrong and pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I’m gonna put that out there right fucking now."
29,Carson is a weird way to spell Karen
30,"Who's okay with that first part? And who cares if these Christofascists pray? Frankly, I wouldn't mind if that's all they did."
31,Whos getting naked and dancing for children?
32,They act like underage religious marriage isn't the biggest source of pedophilia in America
33,Hail Satan!
34,"Where  are these naked people dancing for children?

Some bible thumper's fevered imagination, no doubt.

<edit> Or some back room in a Catholic / Baptist / Mormon et. al. church..."
35,Was there not something recently in the news about bringing children to watch pole dancing?
36,"That’s not apoplexy, it’s howls of derisive laughter."
37,What!?
38,"I think they are referring to pride parades but they aren't necessarily made for children. I mean, since they are public events, children can in theory attend. But I would also say just keep your kid away if you are concerned. 

I don't think there are any naked dancers at Drag Queen story time or any other events like that. 

Also, I have zero issues with my kids seeing a person pray or read a holy book. All types of people in the world and they should learn that there are people of different creeds. I do have a problem with kids being indoctrinated"
39,"I'll admit, sometimes... I raise an eyebrow and roll my eyes a little bit. Not where people can see. Just privately.  
  
Maybe the fact that they know, deep down, that people feel that way is just as scathing to their feelings as apoplexy. Because deep down they know it's justified, and they're embarrassed."
40,Who is this dickhead?
41,"At this point in the game; I think we should come for them.  They want to be the victims so bad.  Let’s let them.  For centuries Christians killed anyone who wouldn’t follow the word of God.  
We’ve seen through the shitty facade.  If there is anyone who should be weary of the creator’s wrath it’s these idiots."
42,What the hell do these people think goes on at drag shows?
43,"Ah yes, modern Christian hatred is centered around individual adults doing their individual innocent religious activities. Definitely not the minority Christians heavily pushing anti-human and anti-choice bills through to deny the existence of LGBT people and to force cis-women into certain gender expectations."
44,Which god?
45,You're both evil. Now could all of you evil ones kindly fuck off the planet please.
46,Oh no! Carson krow is done pretending I’m not evil! What will I do!
47,Who's dancing naked with kids??
48,Also who is okay with naked adults dancing in front of children?
49," No one cares if you make the personal choice to pray, it’s when you force or threaten others into praying with you when it becomes a problem.

Also drag queens are not dancing naked in front of children. That’s just a COMPLETE lie."
50,They really are desperate to be considered victims arent they...
51,We're there naked strangers dancing for children? And I've never gotten angry about anyone praying in my life.
52,"Hey Lady - speaking as a parent here. 

Strip clubs are for adults. Maybe do some research before walking into an establishment called ""bouncing bunnies"" with your kids. 

Just a thought."
53,Victim mentality needing to be bolstered by fabricating completely fictitious scenarios.
54,"Are you not demonstrating a lack of faith in god’s plan, and therefore god, by attempting to interfere with other people? It seems this incessant campaigning equates to lack of faith which, according to your rules, is penalized by an eternity in hell. So either you’re a fraud or you should stfu and demonstrate a little faith."
55,"I don't give a shit if you pray. I'd find it inappropriate to lead some kind of sectarian prayer in public school ( and so would she if, for instance, someone had the kids kneeling towards Mecca ) but I, personally, actually don't really care that much about prayer. I have religious friends who pray in front of me, it doesn't hurt me in any way.

That's kind of the whole thing with being an agnostic atheist. I literally think prayer basically doesn't do anything, so knock yourselves out. I refrain from praying myself but, to be honest, I largely refrain out of respect for the religious rather than because it would bother me to pray.

*If* naked people are actually dancing in front of kids ( and I doubt it's common, although I'm sure every bad thing eventually happens somewhere ) they **definitely** shouldn't do that, but I reject the strawman that it's somehow able to be spun into a **generalized** anti-LGBT thing."
56,Who is taking their kids to the strip club ?
57,That‘s a big ass strawman.
58,"I'm sorry, I may vie for taking away the privileges of open public christianity, but I have no idea who's mad that adults are praying.

Persecution much?"
59,"I know Christians, atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Jews, Wiccans, and Hindus and none of them are okay with naked strangers dancing in front of children and none of them have a problem with adults praying.  What they (and I) DO have a problem with is those who call themselves Christian but preach hate, intolerance, and bigotry trying to force their religion on everyone else.  This is neither the rule of law in the USA nor the teachings of Jesus."
60,"You hear jokes/retellings about things like ""my girlfriend had a dream I was cheating, and was angry at me when she woke up"".

These sorts apparently live in that sort of waking dream perpetually, whipping themselves into a frothing frenzy over all the things they imagine happened/are happening."
61,"Im not ok with naked strangers dancing in-front of kids, whoever posted this is just making stuff up"
62,The things they have invented in their heads and they seem to love thinking about nake people around children.  Which should put them on a watch list.
63,"Same, I'd really like to know"
64,"I believe they’re equating child friendly drag shows with “dancing naked” in front of them, if I had to guess."
65,"https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/pride-parade-kid-friendly_ca_5d013916e4b0dc17ef03287b 

I’m not agreeing with her what so ever (queer myself) but when it comes to the discussion of minors and sexuality the water is quickly muddied. 

Just in general no kid should be forced into any religious practice, but I also wouldn’t want kids seeing kink equipment or particularly revealing clothing for really any reason."
66,"If I had to guess they're bringing up the drag queen story time thing, which featured neither nudity, nor dancing"
67,"I assume she's talking about drag queens?

After all, I remember clearly as a child that part in every pantomime show where Widow Twankey would come out and do a striptease."
68,Does she mean the pride parade?
69,"If I had to put $$$ on it, this is about drag queens.

Which ironically, before all this drag queen controversy came up, the only time I ever heard of drag queens coming up outside of TV/movies is from a group of people who most definitely are part of the group that is so appalled by drag queens at the moment.

I grew up in a small, fairly rural town.  I moved to the city after college, but still keep in touch with some HS friends almost exclusively through social media.  An old friend, who I can guarantee is a Trumper (probably not hardcore MAGA, but definitely a rural, blue collar Republican, so do the math).  Anyway, he started posting pics years ago from Drag Queen Bingo, which apparently was a regular event at the local firehall or similar venue.  Now, again, do the math.  Small, rural, blue collar town that regularly votes close to 70% GOP.  Who do you think comprised the audience for Drag Queen Bingo?  Guarantee 75% of them were Trump’s base.  And was this an adult event? Hell no.  This was fun for the whole family.  Come watch big, burly bearded alpha male Dad pose for pictures getting friendly with the drag queens they imported (because God knows no drag queens call that town their home).  A rooting, tooting good ol’ time.

And here we are, 5 years down the road and suddenly those same drag queens all those MAGA folks from my home town were voluntarily taking their families to see are suddenly groomers."
70,"It's those evil people with knives and black skull tshirts who smoke the reefer and exist only to maim, murder, kill, and have wild insane 17 person orgies all day long. Just reefers and titties going every which way up and down, left and right, but mostly in pentagramal shapes as they summon actual batwinged demons who smell of sulfur and cum to their orgies. Nothing but booze and condoms and birth control, as these sickos safely suck and fuck for hours and hours, weeks on end, only stopping to sacrifice the person who came the least yesterday and feast on their blood. Not a single pregnancy or std in sight, as these absolute freaks use proper safe sex practices only as a means to spit in gods face and then use that spit as lube while they wear spaghetti strap tops and shorts that are above the knee. Absolutely deranged sinners who can't stop jizzing and squirting on demons as they summon entire armies of evil with the sole purpose of making the holy saints get angry and sin after stubbing their toes, sending them spiraling out of control into these coke fiend orgies. Once holy and righteous people just slurping and plowing left and right until they're all dried up and can no longer cum, then they're sacrificed to the dark one and sent directly to hell, where you're forced to commit vile acts of debauchery, still eternally porking and spanking with rough bdsm practices forever.       
     
Or at least that's what my Bible tracts say."
71,"The Vatican, maybe?"
72,"That was in France, if my childhood education holds up."
73,Probably drag queen story hour
74,It has to reference to the drag queen reading time right?
75,"Gay people at pride parades oBvIoUsLyyyyy

BIG /S"
76,They appear to think that family-friendly drag shows involve nudity.
77,My country kinda had one of those. The resulting moral panic helped getting our current president elected and got my state to ban artistic performances with nudity from being watched by children.
78,"They love to pretend that cherry picked instances, highlighted by right wing propaganda outlets and often removed from all context (like the drag queens in the ice cream shop and snap shots from pride marches) are real normalized everyday things in those evil places like San Francisco. 

These same people will bend over backwards to defend or completely ignore actual child predators when it happens in a church or the GQP."
79,I think her church calls it “Bible study.”
80,"Cheerleaders, right? At the Super Bowl, maybe? There's a lot of almost naked dancing, with plenty of kids in tow at the stadium and in the televised audience... But no, they never seen to have a problem with that or with the violence of American football. 
Or could it be the made up cabal of baby-eating Democrats who are dancing naked for children? Yes, that seems much more likely!"
81,A nudist beach???? Even that would be a wide stretch.
82,Music videos and tik tok.
83,"They are really trying to convince people that drag story time = strippers dancing. I've seen this argument on twitter in real life, it's astonishing to me."
84,"All i can think of is the trans person who read books at the library. 
Kids were present.
Clutch your pearls."
85,The gays^tm
86,"That’s totally a person in the position of the state pressuring students to participate in religion. A coach decides who gets playing time, which positions they get, and whether they’re even on the team. They can sway other players’ opinion for or against that student. And that student’s athletic career can affect ability to get scholarships for college and critical events that determine that student’s future. 

Forcing religion from that place of power and then claiming to be a victim is fully infuriating."
87,"My husband is a very vocal secular humanist and he would freak the fuck out if our kid was made to pray. 

And I’d come bail him out of jail. It’s like date night!"
88,"I came to comment the same.
I don't even care if after the game he walked over to the 50 yd line by himself and bowed his head in prayer. But, that's not what he was doing. It's one of the few instances a dissenting judge included a picture in the dissent.  Not a quiet prayer.  
I do recall a bible somewhere talking about the wrong way to pray in public... Do they even read the damn thing?"
89,But are you ok with naked strangers dancing for children?
90,"well, i'm done pretending any different"
91,"I mean, any power structure over children is going to attract that sort of person. Functionally none of them are different, though religions have a system of morality that assumes anyone *in* the religion is inherently more trustworthy/less sinful. This is, of course, not the case, but there is a benefit of a doubt given to people from your church.

ETA: This also used to be the case for teachers and school staff as well. You can see how well that turned out for either."
92,Adam and Eve had those leaves so it couldn't be them.
93,"I’m sure she’s making a disingenuous reference to Pride Parades and hardly dressed that march in them. 

Children should only be exposed to that kind of thing during Victoria’s Secret commercials or at the beach. It’s completely inappropriate because they’re gay and I don’t like that shit 

Signed,
Idiot Lady"
94,And can i count is as a child if i am 19? Asking for a friend
95,This is so wild to me. My 16 year old coworker got with her 20 something year old youth group leader. And she’s heavily Christian. What the fuck?
96,"Yeah, it was used on the conspiracy theory sub as fodder that they're sexualising children when people told them that wasn't the case they still kept saying it."
97,the alliteration excites my literature major soul
98,Lmao!
99,"Because instead of it being a hobby/art form/self expression, it’s a misogynistic caricature of women. And we all know the right loves anything misogynistic"
100,"*What naked strangers*

*Dance for children? What is she*

*Going on about?*
