1,Kid can look forward to years of therapy once they figure out their parents are nuts.
2,"Pillars of the earth.... Resting on what? Why would a flat earth need fucking pillars?


Do they think earth is a giant cake platter?


Fuck flat earth! I'mma wait for the cake landing event. The promised day!"
3,Those people are fucking nuts. Ruining their children minds.
4,"The sun and moon are spheres in this model. Do flat earthers believe that the earth is flat and sun and moon are spheres? Also, they are both within the dome. How do they think night and day work?"
5,"Let's look at this logically. Every single thing we see in the night sky is round. Stars are round, galaxies are round. The moon and the Sun are round.  Black holes are round.  Even asteroids are round, and their roundness is a direct reflection of their mass.
So all of this heavenly roundness exists, but the earth is flat?
What pisses me off about flat earthers, is that they stubbornly cling to this stupid idea without attempting to prove the flatness. If I truly believed the earth was flat I would devote my life to proving that it is flat, not simply denying the tons of proof of its roundness."
6,"And the say the LGBTQIA+ Community is indoctrination children.

Anyone going to point out that this map seems to have fucked up the shape of every other continent except America? Not to mention seems to be missing the entire South Pacific?

If the earth needs pillars and is flat... why is the ocean not empty since there's nothing keeping the water on and water always finds the lowest point?

These idiots don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. They should not be allowed to homeschool their kids."
7,I bet one day the kid grows up and realizes their parents were nuts and hates them for it.
8,"Pillars? Why would a flat earth need pillars in space? Ice wall? 

It‚Äôs so sad how much information we have available and how little some use it but I bet this is one of those ‚Äú99% of all collected info over thousands of years is wrong because I just dont FEEL like it‚Äôs right‚Äù psychopaths"
9,"It always hurts to see children being brainwashed, but in that case the child probably will be bullied for believing in the most nonsense bs. Wonder if their parents are taking it into account.
I hope this post is fake and sb wanted to troll but I'm afraid it's not"
10,Debating whether it would be fascist intervention or not to remove children from homes like these
11,This is why homeschooling is not a thing in a lot of cou tries
12,"As a teacher, and as a person, this fills me with rage and despair. Imagine in 2022, with all the modern marvels humanity has created and discovered, to purposely teach your children ideas that have been outdated for CENTURIES and really drill that bullshit into their heads is on the level of child abuse. We need licenses to drive a car but any random asshole can create a child and fuck that kids life up, seemingly out of ignorance or for the lulz. Unreal and depressing."
13,Geocentrism doesn't feature a flat earth. Some people just shouldn't be allowed to breed.
14,"Why are there no flat earthers on expedions trekking to the egde to bring back proof?

Also what are the those parents going to teach their children about coping with holding such a minority view?

I hope those kids get a chance to stand on a cliff overlooking the open sea on a clear calm day"
15,That poor child will know nothing of the real world because of this.
16,Poor kida. He's gonna have a fucked up life
17,"Not only is the earth flat, apparently our system is geocentric. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
18,Is there no oversight or agency that keeps homeschooling in check so kids don‚Äôt learn bullshit but actually learn stuff they‚Äôll need to actually get degrees?
19,Obviously there are Bible verses that support flat earth theory. BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS FLAT WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND ITS NOT REAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. Jesus Fucking H Christ on a popsicle stick. I weep for that child.
20,Bro they put north America in the centre üíÄ
21,I have witnessed homeschooling taking place in houses where I have cleaned windows. Not impressed. No real discipline and lax supervision. How is this better than a trained teacher who actually understands the subject at hand and can answer questions intelligently?
22,I wonder how long till the kid figures out that everyone else is actually right and their parents are the ones that are wrong.
23,"Okay, but where's Ankh-Morpork? I don't see the Tortoise, let alone the Elephants."
24,"I'm sure they're proud of themselves.

![gif](giphy|WQUHJt3Fwh6fBGo3Lu)"
25,These parents want their children to hate them when they're adults
26,"This actually gives me a little (tiny) hope for the kids. While I agree this is child abuse, something so easily disproved will get the kids to question their parents ideas early. All their other indoctrination will be up for grabs too. I hope, at least. It's still terrible though."
27,You can clearly see that they didn't kniw what they were going to do to make this thing believable and logical
28,"This is fucking insane, it's fucking child abuse.

And a question for flat earthers, how is there sunrise and sunset? Solar and Lunar eclipses? Seasons? The day and night cycle is pretty much broken, during a sunset or sunrise, the sun goes under the horizon, but if the earth is flat, what is the horizon then? How does the sun go under the horizon? How do moon phases work? Timezones are also broken.

If you say space doesn't exist, and it's a dome, why can I see with a telescope the International Space Station when it passes by? An illusion?  Why are other planets spherical? Where is your ice wall? Why is it that when I go in a straight direction from America for example, in a straight direction I find myself in Asia? Wouldn't I find the ice wall instead?

Brainwashing poor kids into believing nonsense and stories. This is just fucking cruel."
29,Poor kid going to be dumb af
30,"This is a thing that bothers me about homeschooling, some parents are just sooo stupid and the more stupid they are the smarter they think they are."
31,Did they just forget to include the African continent or am I just missing it? lolol
32,Ok but where is the other half of the World?
33,poor kid
34,This is just so sad
35,That‚Äôs fucking child abuse.
36,"I like how their moon and sun RIGHT IN THE MODEL are round. But the earth could not possibly also be. Nope, only flat thing, surrounded by round things."
37,No turtle? Don‚Äôt even know their own schtick.
38,That's why homeschooling is forbidden in my country
39,What is their theory for day and night? Like how would the sun disapear on that model?
40,"Why are the moon and sun spheres?  Also, how is it even possible to be this stupid?"
41,They do try to prove it flat and contiously prove that it‚Äôs round. See the documentary: Behind the Curve
42,"I'm from Canada... if this is true (and not a joke), we probably have those here as well, 

But I CANNOT believe that there are that many flatearthers around the world... (and I mean it, A-ROUND the world...)."
43,"Haven't made the Earth square "" four corners of the Earth "".

Anyone going to tell them ""massive fail"", even for flat Earthers üßê"
44,"LOL holy shit, I hate every word of this. 
These people are setting up future generations to fail from the get-go. Fail in every sense of the word, too, at this point."
45,"One question, why are they even allowed to be homeschooled, so much for freedom. Denying the efforts and hard earned results of scholars from lots of generations stretching around the globe is not only idiotic. But i no word in any language's dictionary can even the tell about the emptiness I am feeling that the next generation of humanity is still debating the question of shape of earth when they should have been asking more lovely questions."
46,They appear to use an azimuthal projection. There for the center and the entire outside ring are cold areas??
47,"Based on this logic, the sun must have roughly equal mass to the moon AND the Earth must be massless."
48,‚ÄúbUt ThE BiBLe SaYs sO!‚Äù
49,"This is criminal, how is this allowed.  We no a man that was raised like this.  He‚Äôs laughed out of most job interviews. He Couldn‚Äôt get into any secondary education.  (College) His life was a mess for years."
50,"If they can‚Äôt trust the things science tells us, why do they trust the continents are the shapes they are?"
51,"WTF is wrong with people? I have zero respect for these morons. & yes; I absolutely judge them as well as think they are utterly stupid, vapid, ignorant, gullible & unteachable. I have no patience for people who buy into this garbage"
52,Ayo but don‚Äôt forget that gay people are the groomers apparently
53,"The kids are smart, the parent isn‚Äôt"
54,"Anyone wanting to homeschool their kids should have to take a competency test. If you don't understand basic math, physical science, history, etc then your kids go to a real school, like it or not. Too many young adults enter the real world with no fucking clue about anything that matters, all thanks to crackpots like this.."
55,Pillars?  Heretics.  Everyone knows it is a turtle.
56,And this is why homeschooling is bullshit
57,"We let them roam the streets and vote,"
58,"If the earth isn't flat, then why when the surface is made up of 70% water is none of it carbonated?"
59,Don't homeschooled kids have to take a standard exam to show their progress to the education supervisors?
60,"What the actual fuck...

Flat Earth, which started out as a joke, is now real for people 

Insane...

*p.s. on the flat earth how long does it take to fly from Buenos Aires to Johannesburg*"
61,Earth is flat but the other celestial bodies are spherical?
62,"'Ice wall out of modeling clay.'
Are they making a map of Westeros or something? Then again it still wouldn't make sense even if they were."
63,Homeschooling should be illegal unless the kid is actually medically exempt from going to regular school and even then they should have professional teachers coming into the home to actually teach the kids.
64,"They're obviously right, that's totally how it works.

![gif](giphy|L6v5VWIyLK0Mw)"
65,Things like this are the reason I believe more and more that homeschooling should be illegal.
66,Ooh.  I want to see her show how airplanes make some flight times.
67,how come the sun and the moon are round then
68,I‚Äôd love for them to illuminate that sun with a light bulb and show us all how it works exactly
69,"So, flat earthers should be the biggest advocates to reverse climate change.  If the ice wall is the only thing keeping the oceans on this disc of an earth then we are in dire need to preserve them."
70,"Intelligence may be genetic, but ignorance is contagious."
71,Are we surprised that North America is in the middle of the universe?
72,I feel the same sadness over this as I do with any religious indoctrination of children.
73,Still missing 4 elephants and a giant seaturtle ..
74,r/mapswithoutnz
75,how the fuck can you look at the moon and sun and think yeah those are definitely circling above me all day long. do they think that once the sun gets to the other side of the atlantic ocean the light just can't reach us?? even with no curvature to block light? it's mind boggling
76,"this right here is exactly why (in my opinion) home schooling needs to be more regulated, including monitored testing to make sure they're learning at the least the standardised curriculum for english, science, history, geography and sex education (and for the love of goodness don't let it be abstinence only, it's ridiculous with the knowledge we have now that it's legal in some states)"
77,"That's not even what's meant by a geocentric model. Anyway, the real failing here is that these nutjobs continue to be approved and certified as able to home school a child."
78,Why do some people choose ignorance. It is baffling. And then to pass it on to their innocent children.
79,"Throwback to learning ""science"" of the earth and its history while being homeschooled and having it be nothing but the creation story and then, ""how to remain willfully ignorant and also don't forget that evolutionists are brainwashed by the devil, how sad is that.""

... secondary throwback to my mom implying evolutionist thought humans literally formed out of puddles of mud like fantasy slime creatures spawning in a D&D session. And then believing God took a handful of dirt, blew on it and spawned Adam like a deity creating a race in a D&D session."
80,Yeah the kid didn't make that. I know because you specifically said they did
81,World is going to hell . Anyone ever saw the Movie ‚ÄúIdiocracy ‚Äú.? This is the move coMing into fruition. 20 years from now full blown movie mode .
82,Just out of curiosity. How do eclipses work in fruitcake logic ?
83,God said the earth was suspended upon nothing so why the TP rolls?
84,Damn. Those kids are gonna be stupid cause the parents are fucked.
85,I what world is this not child abuse?
86,This is why homeschooling is illegal in Sweden
87,Can someone please help me understand how a person can be so in deep with flat earth that they literally buy a D O M E for their FLAT model while having ROUND SPHERES TO REPRESENT THE MOON/SUN/PLANETS????
88,"That model looks like one of those ""look what my kids did!"" that was actually done by the perfectionist parent type things."
89,Maybe the kids will on day look at a sunset and see how the sun magically gets blocked by the ground
90,"Urm her kids look very young, no way did they precisely cut and set up this model by themselves. It's almost as if she is looking for praise and validation on her own incorrect work. Homeschooling should be regulated and tutors provided as many ""homeschoolers"" are very under qualified to teach basics let alone advanced subject levels. They are up there with the unschooling crowds."
91,So the earth is flat but our moon and the sun are round?‚Ä¶
92,Jesus fuck that‚Äôs *child abuse*.
93,"""Pillars"" ??? 

What mf pillars?"
94,So I'm probably gonna get yelled at for this but... That does actually look like a very nice Flat Earth model!
95,That‚Äôs fine. My son will need uneducated workers to work for him when he grows up.
96,Why is this in religiousfruitcake?
97,This is why homeschooling should be banned with only the exception being of physical or mental disability.
98,Wait until the kids tell their teachers what their parents believe in. They're going to be groaning about parent teacher night all year long.
99,"![gif](giphy|l0ErV1aCim8VS2oPm)

Time to remove some crap"
100,Wait...so flat earth AND geocentrism? These poor kids education is fucked right from the get-go.
