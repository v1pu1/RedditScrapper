1,Wow it's like they literally built a straw man and pointed at it
2,"This has ""Atheists do all the things I would do if my religion didn't prohibit them"" energy all over it."
3,If the only thing keeping you away from necrophilia is your fear of hell... Something is wrong with you. Really wrong.
4,why is the concept of consent incomprehensible to these people?
5,"The universe has been providing insane levels of irony lately.

[In 2017 an Islamic scholar gave a fatwa that fucking a dead wife is Halal](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/egypt/2017/09/22/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%B3%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A7-#:~:text=%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.-,%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%20%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%20%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%81%D8%8C%20%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B0%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D9%87%20%D9%81%D9%8A%20%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%B1%20%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84,%D9%88%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86%D9%87%20%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%20%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%A8%20%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%8B.). Of course Al-Azhar denied it and decided that it is Haram.

So, it seems to me that Muslim scholars cannot agree among themselves whether neckrophilia is Haram or Halal."
6,They never have a leg to stand on morally  their prophet consummated marriage with a 9 year old. Any argument they want to make is flawed they follow the teachings of someone that slept with a 9 year old.
7,"Idk which is worse, the fact that they're trying to justify necrophilia or the fact that they don't understand how consent works.

Either way, they're complete social rejects."
8,"If the only thing keeping you from doing this shit is the fragile, empty threat of a hell, you need to be locked up in a fucking asylum never to see the light of day!"
9,Don‚Äôt they worship a pedophile and glorify it?
10,"I am an atheist and I never needed the consent of a dead person, a baby or an animal to sleep with. Why? Because I have no desire to fuck them!"
11,"It violates basic human rights, dignity, and is unhygienic. A Quran isn't needed for that. In fact, violating basic human rights is extremely common in Islamic theocracies, so it's pretty hilarious that they believe they're some sort of moral authority."
12,"We‚Äôd all be bowed up on a corpse, pumping away if not for this book that says not to. Checkmate atheists."
13,"# Basically, this act happens very often in Islamic Pakistan due to the extreme ""Sexual Frustration"" in the society. 

Pakistani newspapers are full of such news that people take out the bodies of newly buried women/girls from the graves and then rape them.  This disease increased so much that relatives of the deceased women/girls have to guard their graves for next many nights. 

[Please this link](https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan&rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&oq=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan+&aqs=chrome..69i57.13885j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and you will find tens of news about rape of dead women/girls in every city of Pakistan (in English). You will find even more news about it in Urdu language. 

\*\*\*\*

In non-religious societies, men have a lot of chances to interact with women, and thus they are not so much sexually frustrated that they go after the dead bodies. 

And even if someone desires such a thing, then it is a sign that he is mentally sick and needs help. 

In a non-religious society, the solution is very simple i.e. The whole society can declare it a crime, in order to save its members from harm. It is exactly the same that some men in non-religious society have tendencies towards taking drugs, but society as a whole declare it to be a crime in order to protect its member from being harmed. 

We, as atheists, consider that NATURE is not perfect. Not all is black and white in our world. Of course, there could be people in the society with tendencies towards crimes and fetish Fantasy. And due to this imperfection of Nature, we find solutions to deal with them. 

If Muslims say that they don't rape dead people while their Allah prohibited it, then we tell them simply that we don't rape dead people while our society has collectively found this solution that raping a dead body is harmful and a crime. 

And the results speak for themselves, where due to unnatural prohibition of interaction between men and women, all Islamic societies are suffering from extreme Sexual Frustration.

Not only Islamic Pakistani society is ahead in raping the dead bodies of women/girls, but they are also no.1 in watching porn films in the whole world.

# Actually, not only porn films, but Pakistani Society is No. 1 in watching INCEST PORN (like sister fuck, mother fuck, daughter fuck, donkey fuck) in the whole world for the last 2 decades (according to google Trend)."
14,"Does it specifically say ""don't fuck dead people"" in the quran?

If so, that's fucked that it's needed.

But if not, then we're both abiding by the same moral compass, which is pretty much just common sense.

Sidenote: I honestly wouldn't care what happened to my dead body. Would prefer it be stripped of organs and the rest donated to science, but if some weirdos get at it first, it won't matter to me (because I'll be dead)."
15,[deleted]
16,What the ever loving fuck is wrong with people?!  ü§¶üèº  Who the fuck even thinks this shit unless there is something institutionalizably wrong with them?!
17,If raping kids is good enough for Muhammad it‚Äôs good enough for them
18,"First, what the fuck? Second, I feel like they can't phantom that atheism is not a cult, like theirs. We don't blindly follow fantasy rules and are not a monolith."
19,"Maybe we dont have sex with dead people because it's repulsive. 

Now, imagine a couple of mentally unwell people who actually have this fetish. If one of them actually consent to have their partner fuck their dead body, it would be ok-ish (?) Because at least is made with explicit consent. 

For example, i have a ""sleep molestation"" fetish. So while I'm awake, i tell my partner that he is allowed to touch me while I'm sleeping. It's ok with me and turns me on, but the consent is the fundamental issue about this.

But yeah, this guy made a imaginary scenario in his head and is now angry at it."
20,"You could probably argue that it would be immoral to cause distress to the family and friends of that person by doing that. But aside from that I don‚Äôt care, throw me in the trash. I‚Äôm dead, I don‚Äôt give a shit. Just because somethings insanely weird and gross doesn‚Äôt make it immoral.  If it is immoral, then just make the fucking argument for why."
21,"Dude, you're gonna get an infection"
22,I‚Äôve never thought deeper than ‚Äúuggghhh! Gross!‚Äù on the subject of corpse fucking.
23,"Coming from the folks who believe that they get virgins when they die. Of course, those virgins are dead too.

Gross. <shudder>"
24,Said the religion suspiciously linked to a lot of pedophilia.
25,so many strawmen here
26,"Every time they make these kind of arguments they are admitting that they have some really weird kinks. I honestly don't care if people want to fuck dead things, as long as they're already dead, but it is disgusting."
27,These people think we think picking up a baby is bad? I know religious people make up arguments against us. But really?
28,"""How can you as a Muslim feel threatened by this?'

I would like to see this question answered. Muslims seem terrified of atheists."
29,"> But they did believe that picking up a baby is immoral because a baby cannot give consent.

Holy fuck, is that mohammed pedo looking for someone even *younger* now?!"
30,Didn't their prophet fuck a six year old?
31,"Setting aside everything the ""these are the people"" atheists are not a monolith lol one online neckbeard does not represent all of us. I'm sure you, a muslim, would understand how that feels :)"
32,"When you're so fucking stupid you pull full confidence from religion in trying to make a point only to have some kind of mental stroke about babies, consent and ""previous owners"".

Of course you don't have to feel threatened by ""us"" we're not batshit crazy. I mean, you combine that with religion and you get mass unhingement. Who wants to be around people like that?"
33,Fuck is he even talking about?
34,Here's a news report from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan about how cemetery caretakers used to open freshly buried coffins of women and had sex with them...https://youtu.be/chxsKhXOu60
35,"coming from a former muslim, i‚Äôm not surprised at all these muslims cant comprehend the concept of consent in sex"
36,it's literally as simple as a dead person can't consent. religious people are the ones historically justifying marital rape - saying she gave consent before so i must still have consent
37,"""atheists cannot say why sex with a dead body is immoral""

&#x200B;

Hi, I'm an atheist. Yes we can. That dead body is dead. And therefore can no longer GIVE consent. Therefore, it is necrophilia, and both immoral (and in many places illegal afaik) to have sex with said dead body. Not only that, it's a fucking dead body, that shit is disgusting.

&#x200B;

thanks for coming to my ted talk."
38,"I'll take ""things no-one actually said"" for 500, please, Alex."
39,"These rants also apply with politics also. If sky or rich daddy don't set the morals, the poor sinning serfs is to dumb and unenlightening to know what is best for them."
40,"It‚Äôs wrong because it‚Äôs disgusting and disturbing‚Ä¶ why would anyone want to have sex with a corpse unless they were deeply fucked in the head? 

Their reasoning is that if a child. Even if we COULDN‚ÄôT demonstrate why it‚Äôs universally wrong to have sex with a corpse and just said ‚Äúit disgusting‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre wrong about everything. Also, ‚ÄúAllah says no‚Äù is far inferior to just saying it‚Äôs disgusting."
41,Reading the comments on that post it seems like it is based on a debate between some self proclaimed atheist philosopher called tjump and someone I assume is Muslim called Daniel.
42,"The poor straw men, someone's always beating them up."
43,Weird flex but okay. I suppose i don't spend time thinking about those things.
44,Is there a reason that Muslims would be debating necrophilia with atheists? Does the Quran include necrophilia?
45,"""if a kid gave consent"" That mf is a clown"
46,What the fuck did I just read??
47,"Actually, it is kind of an interesting philosophical question: why is necrophilia wrong without giving some metaphysical importance to the body even after death. I would say the only reason I personally think it's wrong is that it just *feels wrong.* It's easy to explain why things like pedophilia and zoophilia are wrong because of the issue of consent, but consent only applies to living beings with bodily autonomy. As an atheist I would say that a corpse is an object, not a creature. My disgust with necrophilia implies some sort of metaphysical importance of corpses as objects that morally should not be used to masturbate with."
48,Yeah... I've never seen an atheist trying to justify necrophilia. They seem to largely just think it's yucky like any other normal person.
49,I'd love to hear this person's explanation for why it is okay to have sex with a dead body
50,Just checked that sub and so much of it seems to be either botted or run by the same 5 people just from how every account spells and writes the same
51,"Fucking a dead body is more moral than a 6 year old, just saying."
52,Are those atheists in the room with us right now?
53,He‚Äôs smug as fuck too lol. Just been commenting on his post.
54,What a degenerate
55,This dude posts to r/MuslimNoFap
56,"It‚Äôs a typo, they wanted to say immortal"
57,"Say, do you know if necrophilia is legal in these parts of tamriel?"
58,‚ÄúImmorality‚Äù is a bullshit argument anyway.  Sex with a dead body is *unhealthy* and most likely would result in the spreading of disease among the living.  There‚Äôs your atheist argument.
59,Do you even need morals when something is simply gross?
60,"Only religious people even dream of making this argument. I think it says a lot that atheists just say, ""People should have rights, man"", and then religious people immediately take it to the extreme and talk about fucking animals, kids, and dead bodies. 

Projection, maybe..."
61,"Yeah, before the invention of religion the entire planet raped and murdered and stole all day every day and that's how civilised society was created prior to organised superstition."
62,The fact that lifting an infant is on the same level as fucking a corpse to this person solidifies my daily reminder that religion is the worse thing to have every happened to this species.
63,Oh this sub hates atheists with a passion üòÇ
64,It‚Äôs not immoral.  It is bad because dead bodies have all sorts of nasty fungus and bacteria.  It‚Äôs like not wearing a hardhat at a construction site or riding a bike without a helmet.  It‚Äôs dangerous so we DON‚ÄôT DO IT!
65,Dead bodies can‚Äôt consent. I don‚Äôt know why this is difficult to understand
66,What even are they talking about? That strawman is so fucking thin it's a five strands arranged in a vaguely humanoid shape.
67,[here's some context for the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/wrdenb/comment/ikrylbh/).
68,That‚Äôs some seriously awful person who really needs someone to tell them right from wrong.  I hope he gets the help he needs.
69,If you need an imaginary sky fairy to tell you necrophilia is wrong that‚Äôs a you problem
70,People who believe morality requires a higher power can't comprehend that it actually doesn't. They aren't worth dealing with.
71,Wow if you need religion so you don‚Äôt rape dead people you are a horrible human!
72,How hig is tht mf??
73,What????
74,I really really hope this one is not projection too. Omg.
75,"Who the hell says it's wrong to pick up a baby because babies can't consent to being picked up? Unless by ""pick up"" they mean marrying it, fucking it, or chopping up its genitals"
76,"I'm sorry, what?"
77,Why the heck would you wanna have sex with a dead body?
78,Bro is a closeted necrophiliac.
79,Damn.... Sorry for not having a Allah approved reason for being a decent person
80,fuckin like nobody normal supports necrophilia
81,"Says the group that protect a child rapist, stone people to death and whip people for being gay. Oh and have a history of mob violence, killing people because they insulted their invisible friend and global terrorisim. 

They do all that while constantly saying their book doesn‚Äôt condone it and it‚Äôs peaceful.

So, what‚Äôs the point of their religion if they do this crap anyway? Another pointless religion. And if their book said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fuck dead people‚Äù, they‚Äôd still ignore anyway."
82,"Islam says you can fuck a goat. But after, you have to kill the goat because now the goat is unclean. 

Muslims can't say why fucking a goat is immoral."
83,It‚Äôs not immoral it‚Äôs fuckin gross
84,"I never really understood religion. 

So bare bones it, there is an invisible guy who controls and judges you all day every day. If you believe in this and follow his outdated rules then you go to heaven. He also told someone to kill his son. He also flooded the world and told a crazy old guy to build a boat to live. To help you get into heaven you read a book about all the magic tricks he did, you also must go to a giant building dedicated to him once a week to prove something.

I have paranoid schizophrenia. If I told my psychiatrist this without mentioning god then I would have a medication increase and/or be put in a secure facility. 

The stuff I experience is real to me and yet they can be free to shout at everyone that their god is real. 

If I do this by yelling that the robots control everyone and want to infect other people I'm the crazy one?

How is my my ""god"" any different from what they yell at you as you walk by. 

And I'm the heavily medicated one? Double standards I say."
85,The irony is the muslim arguing ethics
86,The only people nuttier than fundy Xtians are fundy Muslims.
87,How about common sense?  Not to mention the potential diseases in there.
88,"I've never considered having sex with a dead body to be inherently immoral considering that the previous owner of the body is no longer on the mortal coil therefore technically speaking there is no victim that could potentially be victimized. 

But that is minutia and why I even have this opinion on sex with that bodies I cannot say but apparently in the past I've thought about it which is an interesting introspective upon myself. 

However there are many many good reasons why one should not have sex with a dead body, first and foremost is offensive to the family secondly it's just plain old gross thirdly the dead body cannot give consent, consent is kind of a important thing when it comes to sexual interactions. 

But then one could argue that since it's a dead body it is the same thing as an inanimate object such as a handheld vagina you can get at your local sex shop. And I suppose there's a case to be made there but it's still not justification to have sex with a dead body. 

And it's just a lack of respect if you look at a dead body and you find yourself sexually aroused and not saddened by the loss of life you really need to look into yourself and why you feel that way and perhaps seek professional help for the feelings that you have. 

But the morality of it, I feel like there's a discussion to be had there.

Disclaimer: in no way shape or form am I advocating for any kind of sexual interactions with deceased peoples I am completely opposed against and aghast at such behavior. Furthermore just because I've had the hypothetical thought of it in the past and concluded that I do not want to do this is not indicative of a negative behavior upon myself."
89,Some people think morality only exists with the threat of eternal punishment. They scare me.
90,"Watch out, knowing these subs you'll be sussed out soon and banned lol"
91,"Your brain on religion:

Stay on drugs, kids."
92,"Muslims will always have a hard time understanding that there can be thought and proper reasoning outside of what you are told to do and the contents of the book. To them its alien that a 'morally' good action can come from anywhere other than the invisible big guy and further more needs his divine sanction to make it so.

Then they forget we existed without all this creative bullshit for millennia beforehand. How did we even survive?"
93,It's very easy to win debates when you make them up on your own head.
94,"Ahh damn they got me there, guess Ill go fuck a dead body, since it didn‚Äôt occur to me sooner"
95,"Sex with a dead body is immoral.

There, I said it."
96,The classic inventing a person to be mad at on the internet trope
97,"Um, *because it's fucking gross* isn't enough of a reason for you? Forget God, you need some serious psychiatric help."
98,"Sooo that idea was just chilling up there in the old coconut, buddy?"
99,"""If Allah didn't exist we'd all be having sex with the corpses. Hahaha right guys? (Nervously) religion is the only thing keeping us lustful beasts from getting our way with children and corpses. (awkward) Hahaha. Atheists are so dumb.""

100,Wtf... I didn't realize consent was indefinite when given once.
