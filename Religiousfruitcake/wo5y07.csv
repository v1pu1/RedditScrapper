1,"*Only religion can lead to such evil*

 - Lucretius"
2,I couldn't imagine sending my kid to a school where being murdered over a pot of water was a possibility.
3,"The thing I can't fathom is how fucked up you gotta be to discriminate on water, that too on a child. Discrimination in general is wrong but this is a whole new level. These kind of people deserve no empathy."
4,"As an Indian, I see this shit continue to happen in 2022 and genuinely feel ashamed to belong to this country."
5,"This is the dark side of Hinduism that routinely gets buried, anything that shows their classism for being what it is."
6,"Already on 70%. I swear whenever I see a post about Hinduism here, the downvote brigade appears out of nowhere.   
Usually posts here have 90%+ upvotes."
7,"Religion is poison but people just can't get enough, West or East. Disgusting superstitious bigotry, but the United States is plunging down the same toilet in a hurry."
8,Caste systems need to be dismantled
9,"Huh, I wonder what will happen in your society when the majority religion tells certain people that they are superior? The world wonders. /s"
10,"Abolish reservation bro, casteism doesn’t exist anymore. /s"
11,assholes
12,"“Assaulted”. It’s like deliberately down playing the situation. 

BEATEN TO DEATH FFS"
13,What in the actual fuck
14,Can't wait for the Hindu nationalists on the sub to comment on this
15,"I'm gonna say, if this pot is for teachers to drink water then it should be in the staffroom"
16,"The news is fake

17,Sad how in some corners of the country these practises are still rampant
18,India seriously needs communism
19,"Actually the perpetrators of caste crimes are usually the middle caste and not the traditionally upper caste like Brahmins.

It's just Muslim converts like Palestinians or Pakistanis who commit crime in name of Islam rather Arabs. Not justifying anything, just giving a context.

Hinduism is a F'ed religion."
20,Savage deserves to die of dehydration
21,Life is very cheap in some parts of the world I'm afraid.
22,"It a social structure reinforced especially over generations. Like racism where whites are just seen as ""superior"" people."
23,Being yelled at is bad enough if you're a kid. Murder is insanity.
24,"Don't feel bad, friend. Here in the USA we used some bullshit about the ""curse of Ham"" to justify our own bullshit bigotry. It's a human problem, not an Indian one."
25,Ikr? We've too many religious nut-cases with more hate than blood flowing through their veins.
26,"India like other countries needs an enema. You're not alone, but man this story is fucked."
27,There are probably plenty of  hindutva supporters who love to see criticism of other religions just not their own
28,Uhm sorry for the stupid question but how do you guys determine that percentage?
29,How do you know the stats?
30,Well it’s at 83% right now
31,Heckin' Bots. Same thing when anyone says anything about Kurds in Turkey. You'd be amazed at how many happy Turkish Kurds there are in every group.
32,Maybe because the murderer was not Brahmin as the title suggests. Most of the caste crimes are done by middle castes but branhmins are blamed in all. Reminds me of the film Article 15. I am from the lower caste for anyone who cares.
33,"Wait, I was told by several different Indians that the cast system was abolished. Obviously there are still some remnants. But does anybody know if the cast system has really been outlawed."
34,"Ikr, my made–up Dalit neighbour has a BMW!!! /s"
35,Wdym
36,Why is this downvoted
37,How are Palestinians and Pakistanis converts?
38,"Why yell in the first place? It's water. Fucking WATER. Sometimes I do wish thanos was real tbh. Even though flawed, he was an infinitely better creature than some humans."
39,"Yeah they post a lot about islam. But if it's *them* doing unspeakable horror, then it's 100% ok /s"
40,Primarily just Islam. Got into it with one person who literally said “they deserve it tbh” when I called them out for hinting that genocide against Muslims was the answer.
41,"Think it was removed from new reddit, but old reddit has the % next to the points on the top right. Just replace the ""www."" with ""old."" and you'll see it."
42,"> Think it was removed from new reddit, but old reddit has the % next to the points on the top right. Just replace the ""www."" with ""old."" and you'll see it."
43,"Discrimination on basis of caste *was* signed into law in 1948, but it doesn’t stop castes from existing or people being bigots/murderers about them"
44,"Yeah its illegal

How exactly it works i have no idea. Cuz half of all college seats are reserved for lower castes, but then if the caste system is abolished then such divisions shouldnt exist, so"
45,Usually ask them if it would be acceptable for them to marry a lower class. They're going to look embarrassed.
46,"I guess you live in America or something way far from India and I can tell you that the people you met there are from that so called 'upper caste'. Because they are the only one who can afford the luxury to get settled in another country (Now even people from marginalized communities got chance to settle in other countries which caused discomfort to the 'Upper caste' people like the recent incident happened in google company) and after going there they tell the narrative they are brought up with and refuse the all bad things rooted in Hinduism. 

Don't believe me ? Fine. Just search 'Dalit man died because' on any search engine and you will get your answer
(Dalit- marginalized community)
[Caution: It can be really disturbing. Don't search it if you are not in good mental state]

Edit: Removed the link I provided of a news article after reading the rules of this sub. Sorry guys :-)"
47,"I think they're saying Pakistanis are decendents of those who converted from Hinduism to Islam during the Muslim eastern expansion, and Palestinians are descended from the Jews not kicked out of Israel by the Romans who later converted to Islam. Obviously it's a lot more complex than that."
48,How are they not converts lmao.
49,"I think what he means is IF you are going to be an abusive peace of racist/classist shit, yelling is less harmful than murder.

Which is *not* wrong.

Still morally reprehensible"
50,Lol. Didn’t Thanos want to randomly kill half the universe - innocent people & children included? How is that better?
51,"Ya for real, the world was is a very hypocritical place"
52,"You can see it on new reddit, its just on the desktop version"
53,Thank you for the info.
54,"Is the Indian government doing anything about this? It seams to me, if the lower castes ever got organized it would be civil war. Or is the government and the courts doing just enough to keep this in check?"
55,The term usually applies to individuals who have converted.
56,"If someone’s parent is a convert and they follow their parent’s religion they arent a convert

Think about it, if generations ago someone in your family converted and now you following that religion are considered a convert then literally every religious person is a convert since someone had to convert to that religion when it was invented"
57,Yeah I agree but my point is that why you would yell for a glass of water. Doesn't that make you the absolute worst shit on the planet?
58,">How is that better?

Comparatively better. 

>Didn’t Thanos want to randomly kill half the universe - innocent people & children included?

It was random, dispassionate, fair to the rich and poor alike. 

He did so because there wasn't enough resources and he lost his people because of that. He didn't want the rest of the universe to follow the same fate. 

I think that's much better than killing someone because they like a different sky daddy or none at all."
59,It's easier to take the moral high ground if you live in denial of your religion's flaws
60,"Right now India is a banana republic. Fascists are in power, television media is creating communal disharmony, courts are giving bail to hate mongers and keeping journalist in jail who cover such news and exposes the government, human rights activists are in jail. If not now then in upcoming years India will see something similar like what happened in Nazi Germany. Just the thing is that Indian government can't do all that as easily as Hitler did because there is some kind of pressure on them as other countries are also keeping an eye on it. Muslims are their easy target so for now government's stand on dalit people is confusing it's like love-hate relationship.

Today, India celebrated it's Independence day. Unfortunately India is independent but Indians are not."
61,Hence: morally reprehensible
62,"> Comparatively better.

The death of a single person is a tragedy, a million is a statistic. You can’t compare deaths lol.

> It was random, dispassionate, fair to the rich and poor alike.

Dying for no reason except for the whim of someone is not fair to the dead by any reasoning.

> He did so because there wasn't enough resources and he lost his people because of that. He didn't want the rest of the universe to follow the same fate.

There was no certainty that this would happen.

> I think that's much better than killing someone because they like a different sky daddy or none at all.

Ummm, no. You can’t kill people, period. The logic behind killing someone could be the highest ideal for you but that doesn’t make it “better” than someone else’s murder."
63,"I really never liked Modi. He always seemed to do the political gain over morality every time.

Erdogan, Modi, Trump, and Putin, are power hungry douche bags, and could care less about the body count."
