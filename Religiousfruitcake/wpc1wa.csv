1,Imagine a faith so fragile that you think God can get kicked out of somewhere.
2,Then move to Russia.
3,So Russia figures God needs to learn some things?
4,Sounds like something a Trump/Putin supporter pulled out of their ass.
5,Russia put god in school?? I thought the majority of the population is atheist?
6,So the religious nutjobs are worshipping Russia now? Quite the contrary to how it was in the Cold War
7,Seems pro-america to me
8,"In soviet Russia, God put school in Russians!

Ahhhh fuck it, I'll see myself out..."
9,And Russia is just doing swell!
10,What does this even mean bro???
11,Guess they should go live in Russia?
12,And look how smashingly well things are going in Russia! /s
13,"I thought those Russian commies were the bad guys, though?"
14,And look how amazing Russia is doing....
15,"Christians tend to support Russia because it's very homophobic. You are not allowed to talk about gay people in front of people who are under the age of 18. This is Russia's way of trying to limit the gay population. Like video games for example The Sims 4 got rated 18+ in Russia for including the option to have a same-sex relationship but The Sims 3 is rated like 6+ I think and The Sims games make sexual references like woo-hoo and try for a baby so Russia doesn't care about sexual references being exposed to kids they just care about the gays.

As for if it really can be a safe haven for Christians. It is very much based on Christian values and so on. However, you can't make public protests so this also includes the fact that you can't do street preaching in Russia so yeah they will arrest you if you street preach which is kind of funny when Christians try to promote Russia as being great on Christian ideas because they base some beliefs on Christianity but think the US is oppressing them. In the US you got the right to free speech in Russia you don't."
16,‚Ä¶ ummmmmm‚Ä¶ incorrect??
17,"Imagine praising RUSSIA, out of everything, right now üôÑ"
18,"They... they do realize that Russia is Eastern Orthodox, right? As in faith that encourages worship of pagan gods reflavored as ""Saints""?

It seems to me like they don't even understand why type of Christianity they actually want"
19,"Not going to lie, I kind of want to hear the fictional history that exists in this person head that lets them think ""Russia put God in school"" makes any sort of sense.

Or are they talking about recent trends? If so I'm surprised they've started recognizing Russian Eastern Orthodox as also Christianity."
20,And Russia is ruled by oligarchy and a autocrat. Russia is a mess. America is not to far behind it though.
21,Gods over 2000 years old. If he hasn't passed school yet then he really shouldn't be using federal funds to keep trying at this point
22,Looks like a patriotic atheist that got their truck shot at by some Bible thumper.
23,Wolverines!!!
24,"Oh, sweet. My home state makes another appearance on teh interwebs‚Ä¶"
25,Wouldn't we all love if cuntservatives moved to Russia with their fellow fascists. They can hate gay people and hump the military and flag together.
26,"Russia never 'kicked God' out in the first place, so how did they put him back in?

 Most Communists in the USSR were religious, publicly. State athiesm was about a practice of government- that believers should not let their faith influence the law, and should govern as if there was no god."
27,"So this was America and god's interaction in school

![gif](giphy|U3sOkA3vL7lFLKYw6I)"
28,We have church for that anyway
29,"Stats say about 13% identify as atheist.
The Russian Orthodox church is quite strong with about 40% identifying with them."
30,Russia made America insecure so we embraced religion because Russia was secular. America is a defiant toddler regarding religion.
31,"Russia recently introduced religious/moral education in schools.

Parents can choose from:

* Fundamentals of Orthodox (Christian) Culture
* Fundamentals of Islamic Culture
* Fundamentals of Buddhist Culture
* Fundamentals of Jewish Culture
* Fundamentals of Religious Cultures of the Peoples of Russia
* Fundamentals of Secular Ethics

At first it was supposed to only introduce ""Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture"" without any choice, and there was a lot of talk about it.

I don't have kids and I don't really talk to people with kids, but I have a feeling that ""We can't have a separate class for 2 people"" or ""We don't have a teacher for that"" is quite common.

There's a [Russian Wikipedia page](https://ru-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80_%D0%B8_%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=wapp), translated by Google.

""Statistics"" section looks promising, I'm not sure if it's true."
32,"As someone who lives in Russia, Russian population is definitely not as atheistic. 
And the ‚Äúputting God is school‚Äù I think refers to the fact that for quite a while government and religion officials have been trying to put mandatory religion (Orthodox, of course) classes in elementary school. 
If I‚Äôm correct about that, those classes already exist in some regions (though when I went to school, I had none of that bs)"
33,"This is either about something modern Russia is doing, or about how in response to the Cold War, America really doubled down on religion"
34,They didn't destroyed religion completely and now it rapidly regenerates.
35,"They are trying to drag religion back into state institutions and it sucks about as much as you can imagine. Growing up in the 90s between the fallen apart Union and the newborn state I had no religion or ideology pushed at me in school, my 17 year old nephew hasn‚Äôt been so lucky."
36,Wait a minute we had those additions to our money and to our Pledge of Allegiance because of the Russians. You remember in God we trust. So these low IQ motherfuckers have really gone full autocrat.
37,"Don't forget to tip your waitress! And try the veal!

Up next... Yakov!"
38,They were. Then Putin bought the Republican party and now Russia is their best friend. At least until the Saudis or Emirates or some other petrostate buys them out.
39,"No no, it is more-or-less accurate. Under Putin, the Orthodox Church became quite the powerhouse and many schools now have subjects which study Orthodox culture"
40,"Dont want to be that guy but I was born orthodox and I have and still am studying theology (even tho I am atheist). There are very few and  between differences between orthodocs and catholics. Saints are not worshiped as some other religions worshiped pagan gods. The prayer towards saints is basically ""asking"" the saints to put a word for us in front of God. Also, the catholics have way more saints than us. The ""criteria"" is harsher on our side (an example is Saint Augustin)."
41,"Not a fictional story. After the USSR fell, Putin saw the Christian evangelical movement in the USA and turned Russia into a ""Christian nation"". He's been playing master level chess against America's ""beginner back porch checkers with a few pieces missing"", and American religidiots are eating it up!!"
42,"&#x200B;

43,What is this from?
44,What a concept!
45,"That‚Äôs all post USSR, Soviet Russia was primarily atheistic. Putin has strengthened the church to gain more control of the masses."
46,"Yeah was about to say this. They probably offer the Christian one and then, if they *do* offer the others it's like a leaky portable out back üôÑ"
47,"Didn't have those lessons in my school. Unless changes are very recent. The closest religious education we had was just a general study of every religion, including the religion of ancient civilizations and such. Although it technically counted as after school activity and you could skip it."
48,"This, this the whole problem in a nutshell of what the issues are in the usa"
49,Republicans are cheap sluts‚Ä¶US can buy them back. But not sure if they worth it.
50,"Oh shit, I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs news to me"
51,"Perhaps, but in my personal experience (as a Russian) people tend to ""ask"" the saints for stuff like if they were gods of a pagan pantheon even if they themselves don't consider it a pagan practice.

Pray and ask X Saint for protection, pray and ask N Saint for money, etc. Many believe in folk superstitions and various spirits that they must ""appease"" so they'd let them go and whatever. But perhaps I am biased towards Russian Orthodox, specifically. I don't really have much experience of interacting with any outside of Russia.

That said, it doesn't really make my point any different. After all, isn't using a religious symbol to pray upon, even if it's of the ""right"" God, a form of idolatry? Many people hold items like crucifix and especially Icons as sacred, even though they should be treated as nothing but pieces of wood by the logic of the Bible"
52,The Boys
53,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\_in\_the\_Soviet\_Union#:\~:text=Soviet%20policy%20toward%20religion%20was,doctrine%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Soviet_Union#:~:text=Soviet%20policy%20toward%20religion%20was,doctrine%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party).

Yep.  The USSR was primarily atheist.  They didn't want any power to come from any belief other than belief in the state."
54,"This, *and* to catch the eye of American Christians. Putin played American Christians like a violin. He saw the TEA Party/ Christian fundamentalist movement growing, got out ahead of it, turned Russia into a ""Christian nation"", which he proudly mentioned in an interview with Oliver Stone. He knew what he was doing, practically gloating that *that* made Russia better than the United States without actually saying it. The saddest thing is that American Christians fell for it. There is *no universe* in which Vladimir Putin is a good person, and American Republicans are taking his side. It's disgusting!"
55,"Ah, haven't watched yet. Going to at some point soon."
56,"Yeah, those masses too."
57,You shan‚Äôt regret it!
