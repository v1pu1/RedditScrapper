1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"This is overt abuse apologism. Trivializing it as a fetish is inappropriate. Even if he does have a fetish, it is not the root of these beliefs. Misogyny is."
2,"A husband owes his wife safety...except for when he feels like beating the shit out of her, I guess. 

Fucking monster."
3,Let's not downplay this by calling it bdsm. This is just straight up advocating for abuse.
4,calling this a fetish is sugarcoating it
5,"This shit reads like someone who is turned on by BDSM (particularly the S part) but has never heard of the concept of a safeword, and paints apologetics on it because they need a scapegoat to absolve them of their self-imposed guilt for being into it due to their repressive religion

Or they're just an asshole

Take your pick"
6,Thankfully men like this are becoming more vocal so it will be easy to avoid them
7,Absolutely foul
8,I don't think this is a fetish as much as it's a domestic abuser trying to convince others that his abuse or desire for abuse is pious or at least moral.

10,"Right. And I love the way he 'owes' her sex, but not love and affection.  So basically she's owed the sex that HE wants.  

Rape, what a lovely gift.  ðŸ˜¡"
11,"On the other hand, people think this is normal enough that they can put it out there.  And other fruitcakes are watching."
12,"Perhaps a ""would be"" or ""ex"" domestic abuser who, either due to having never been married or having had a wife who wised up and left his ass, is now an incel."
13,Plenty of people perpetuate domestic violence in the name of religion.  Don't downplay the abuse by thinking it doesn't happen.  It does.
14,"Thankfully other fruitcakes are the ones who find it normal, and it hasn't tainted the normal population too badly. But I wouldn't get too comfy."
