1,LOl when did the church started seeing the Walking dead series?
2,"I never understood this logic. 

Jesus died for our sins and now, thousands of years later, we have to follow him for the rest of our lives for something we possibly haven't even done yet just so he can forgive us later? 

Isn't everything a God's plan, which means we have no control over our actions? But at the same time God gave us all a free will, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
3,"Here's the problem with the ""Everyone is already damned"" rhetoric. 

It doesn't actually encourage conversion and repentance.

Seriously, why bother trying to atone and be a better person if you're already damned anyway?"
4,"The whole ""God loved you so much that he had his son murdered to save you from damnation ... despite being the one to damn all of humanity in the first place, of course!"" thing always just makes God look like a narcissistic abuser.

""Look what you made me do! Now, I will pull some weird self-sacrificial stunt that you did not ask for to show you how much I love you ... and if you don't appreciate it you're a worthless, ungrateful brat!"" was literally something my abusive parents did to me ALL THE TIME."
5,"Zombie atheists are coming for your brains, and leaving church hungry."
6,Muslims can form a logic through jihad laws to justify evil acts upon non-Muslims. So this is the Christian version of it I assume.
7,I feel like this breaks copyright laws
8,Braaains 🧟‍♂️
9,If it's an employee only bathroom I'd complain to your manager or HR if you have it. If it's a bathroom open to customers you're out of luck unfortunately.
10,That's pretty offensive (if you're one of those who look for things to be offended by). The arrogance of organised religion seems to grow exponentially.
11,"Use it, and then tape it back up."
12,"Hey you guys! You've all been misbehaving and I have to punish you. Yeah, bad news, right? But hey! I just had a thought. What if I miracled a son into existence, and I just kill him instead? Like, in the most gory way possible. Then I won't have to punish you. Good idea right? Oh, but you have to thank me for it. Like all day, every day, forever. Or, I'll punish you anyway.      

You're welcome."
13,"God arranged for his son to be killed by torture so that the sins he created could still plague mankind and condemn them to eternal torture.   God sounds like a fucking asshole to me.  But it's all cool cause by becoming a complete hypocrite and kissing God's psychopathic ass I can get a slim change to live in the sky.  No thanks, I'll just live my life then be worm food."
14,So the walking dead have to follow the zombie jesus.
15,Omg these are like the spiritual “comic books” that my kids used to get while trick or treating from Jehovah Witness families. They showed all the trick or treaters being dragged to hell by Satan for participating in Halloween. Get a grip. If you object to participating then don’t but don’t  shame the rest of us.
16,Does the wrestler mankind know about thos god that loves him so much
17,Are you what?
18,Are you among… 📮
19,Amongus
20,Isn't a whole driving point in the actual franchise that every human has the virus which zombifies people upon death?
21,In the bathroom? Just looks like extra toilet paper to me
22,"Take it down, throw it away, rinse and repeat."
23,"Can someone explain the concept to me. I was raised going to church up to 3 times a week. The story goes:  people were sinners so god sent his son to be sacrificed so all sins will be forgiven and who ever accepts Jesus as their personal savior will be given a place in heaven. Those who do not will be condemned to spend eternity in hellfire. 

So here are my questions:  why?  God is supposedly omnipotent. He can do anything he wants. Why would he make someone suffer and die a horrendous death. He could have just forgiven everybody. Just like when you go to Catholic confessional. Pray to god and ask forgiveness. There was no need for Jesus. God had the power and authority to forgive or not forgive. What was the true purpose?  It just seems so sadistic"
24,Remember the time where the church made people pay penance for their mortal soul to be saved and sins could be forgiven as easily as buying cupcakes from the market? They can’t make up their minds
25,Christians love spreading these random terrorising threats to brighten up everyone's day. They live in fear and want others to be in the same boat so they don't have to admit they don't like living that way.
26,He loved me so much that he created his own son to die cause of a rule that he originally made? Why not just change the rule?
27,They practically invented it with one of the first popular zombie stories.
28,"That's the marval of ~~the scam~~ salvation: it doesn't matter what we did, are doing, or will do, we're automatically sinners in need of saving thanks to two dopes eating a bit of fruit in a garden thousands of years ago.

So biblically speaking our free will boils down to choosing between ~~obeying the Church, so start tithing~~ Jesus or staying damned, nothing else we do really matters.

Like the old joke goes: God sacrificed himself to himself to save us from himself because of a rule he made himself."
29,"By Christian logic, you’re still culpable for the sins of the first humans. Therefore you’re deserving of eternal fiery torture from birth."
30,"God is that Clown in the ""Saw"" movie series.   Except not as kind."
31,Goes double when you throw predestination into the mix. So their god creates souls with the intent of overcrowding hell.
32,"Spoiler Alert: It reminds me of this one Powerpuff Girls’ episode, Major Competition, where a supposed new hero on the scene >!sets up the problems ahead of time to solve.!<"
33,I'd be very surprised if it doesn't
34,"Supposedly when you get to heaven the only thing you do there, all day and every day, is sing songs to god and tell him how awesome he is…every waking minute. Doesn’t sound like much a selling point."
35,wat
36,I also went to church 3 times a week for about 15 years and ask the same thing! Why not just skip the whole sacrificing your son thing and just forgive everyone’s sins? Why go through all the extra theatrics and torture your own son?
37,"Ah, yes, the Fist of Jesus one"
38,"Doesn't require original sin, the list of things that Christians will tell you are ""sins"" is so broad that the average 4-year old is already a ""sinner"" bound for hell."
39,"Oh okay. Well then it doesn't matter at all if we are still culpable for the sins of the first humans or not.

Let's say we *are* still culpable for their sins. If you don't accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you're fucked. 

And if we *are not* culpable...you'll still be fucked if you don't accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior.

This seems like just a scare tactics to try convert people to Christianity. Insane."
40,And the Muslims with their 67 virgins.   Forget it.  Best sex I ever had was a 36 yesr old mother of two.
41,The sign says god loved mankind so much i wonder if god loved other wrestlers. was god a wrestling fan?? Is that why hulk hogan calls everyone brother??
42,"YES!!  What type of father plans this scenario for his own son, when the alternative is better, easier and without pain?  Is this the example we are supposed to follow?"
43,"I was thinking of the bible myself, but whatever works for you."
44,"Yup. I never could make sense out of any of it, so I’ll just take my chances. Even if I thought there was the slightest chance it was real ( which I don’t) I wouldn’t worship it. That god is a monster if it is real."
45,"OH. A WRESTLER. lol I'm fuckin stupid, my bad!

You just see Hulk Hogan in his wrestling costume take to one one knee like fuckin Tim Tebow"
46,[I was talking about this short film](https://youtu.be/GuKV2Z3eYTY)
47,"Yes, writing the title of it did rather give that away."
