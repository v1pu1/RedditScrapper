1,"I could see that message on a dunk tank at a Catholic school, but uhh - wtf is this doing at a public school? That has no place there."
2,"How is that relevant to dunk tanks? Like what is the purpose of writing that on the dunk tank? Do you go to Heaven if you dunk the dude or do you go to Heaven if you refuse to throw the stone because you are not without sin? 

I’m just so confused"
3,"My public high school (almost 20 years ago, I've been graduated since 2008, and started in 2004) had a paid dunking booth, the rest of the stuff would be free. They put in one of the most hated coaches or teachers in the booth and had students pay to dunk and it would go to charity. This is just stupid and against the whole point.

THE POINT is to raise money by charging kids to get their aggression out on a shit teacher they all hate, and the money goes to something nice (charity or back into the school). Not to let some jesus freak advertise his freakishness to your kids for free."
4,"WOAH WAIT!  HOLD ON!  HOLD UP A SECOND!

You mean I can CHOOSE between heaven or hell?   I dont have to worry about being good or repenting or any of that stuff?

All that time wasted as a little kid in church.

I choose heaven please!  Thanks!  Now, its crime time!"
5,"you don't have to specify he's the gym teacher, I can see he's fat, 60, and has a shitty personality."
6,Conscious thought for eternity is my idea of hell
7,Better be contacting the FFRF.
8,"If these people are in heaven, then both options are hell."
9,Where is this? Also- sponsor one that says Hail satan.
10,"Start a tally under ""hell"". See how high you can get the numbers."
11,"Mankind knew they cannot change society, so instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the beasts.

**HEAVEN, OR HELL**"
12,Get your fingers out of that chicken wire or him be losing some knuckles on the next dunk
13,"That’s so offensive. I’d complain. Honestly, it’s not the place for it."
14,That message makes me want to submerge him for a while.
15,Reminds me of [this sign](https://images.app.goo.gl/hzm9ZTmtcHeGQzh86) on route 71 between Columbus and Cincinnati.
16,"I would keep that ""teacher"" away from children..."
17,Magic or magic? It's magic. So nothing happens regardless.
18,I thought this was a guilty gear reference
19,Hopefully the tank is a deep fryer. Would send the message a little better
20,"See if he floats, he's either a duck or a witch"
21,"Church becomes a political organization, Church pays fucking taxes! That's how it works....right?......RIGHT!?!?"
22,"So he's letting kids know his god is just as morally depraved as a mob boss. ""Pay protection money or I'll break your knee caps. Your choice"". An all loving god, people."
23,You just know too that as soon as he gets any sort of reprimanding for this he’s going to be whining about the evil non believers silencing his free speech
24,FFRF.org the freedom from religion organization's website. Get them involved.
25,Which hell?
26,*cringe*
27,"I’ll take hell to get away from you asshats , oh there is no hell you idiots"
28,Is that saying you want to dunk whoever is in that booth cause fuck yeah I do
29,Very uncool. Especially if a public school.
30,I’m so sick of these fucking people.
31,I hope next year a satanist dunk-tank sets up right next to that asshat.
32,"Yeah, it is MY choice, so stop telling me how to live."
33,"Despite the fact that this sucks, there's some serious comedic absurdity in this tableau."
34,he probably borrowed it from his church to use it at the school event. not that it’s any excuse - he absolutely shoulda covered that shit up
35,I’m so torn between dunking this guy repeatedly and being very against giving them any of my money.
36,Whats stopping someone from just going over and dunking him with their hand? And rinse and repeating
37,”Do something mean to this guy just because you find it funny to signal that you want to go to heavwn”
38,Always the vocal ones who have something to hide... and he's the gym teacher...
39,"Where will YOU spend RIGHT NOW


INSIDE a dunk tank or NOT INSIDE a dunk tank


Its YOUR choice

As you can see I chose the FORMER"
40,Would be way more effective to get the message through to those heathen kiddies if it was a fire pit instead of water ol’ coach was getting dunked in…. not going to forget that fucking lesson in a hurry
41,I’d take hell for eternity over spending it with you douchebags.
42,"Hell because I would have run up and slapped the button, let him get up and push it again. By hand..over and over. Waterboarding for Christ?"
43,"I’ll spend it as an unaware of what’s happening, as there is no evidence that a soul exists separately from the physical body"
44,"I'd go out of my way to dunk him deliberately,as hard as I could ."
45,"I'll be dead and in the dirt.

Edit: I'll probably be cremated."
46,"Dunk it. Put a lid on it. Hook it up to your truck. Drive around town. 

aka “outreach”"
47,Neither!
48,I would have flipped it upside down with him in it!
49,Choose hell!
50,"Heaven or hell 

Duel 1

Fight"
51,Technically it should be a barbecue pit.
52,"Free?

The price is too damn high!"
53,The Supreme Court has torn down that separation between church and state. All they had to do was not spend state funds on this and it’s fine for them to have. Disgusting.
54,Or a drunk tank at a Catholic School
55,God has no place in these walls. Just like facts have no place in organised religion
56,you see.... the public school had to get the tank second hand. it still smells like beer
57,"They sneak in in so many ways... 

Middle school. A guy stood just between the sidewalk and the street where our buses were so he wasn't on school property and handed out pocket bibles. I took one because I was too socially awkward to say no. We were between 11 and 14 and no one came out and stopped the guy. I think he did it twice, but I avoided him the second time. 

High school. There was a club that talked about free food and fun games. It was a Christian club and had so much Christian stuff while drawing in the kids who probably couldn't pay for lunch. They wouldn't hand out food till the end so you had to sit through all the Christian stuff. I went to three meetings for the food, but eventually couldn't stand it. I can't remember the club name but my dad confirmed it was in multiple schools.

I know college is different but I had a guy follow me and talk about Christ while I was walking from one building to another because I didn't completely ignore him."
58,Time to call The Satanic Temple. Next years dunking booth will be AWESOME!
59,"I suspect it's a Stealth-Baptism Machine.

Once you're in the (suspiciously grill-surrounded) tank, the teacher whips on his Ministers robes, the choir jumps out of hiding and start singing, and he pulls the lever and says the magic words."
60,"Honestly, it seems like if you successfully dunk the gym teacher it seems like you're condemning him to hell lol. Weird af."
61,I don't get it either.
62,I think it’s meant to symbolize both the capriciousness and ineptitude of god.
63,There is a target on each side so I guess you get to pick? Going to hell babyyyy!
64,I’d pay just to dunk the asshole BEcAUSE of the message! But first id put some rubbing alcohol or something in there so it fucking stingggsss.
65,"Woah, my gym teacher has a great personality"
66,"Honestly same. When I was still a christian I thought about heaven and I’m like, so forever forever? Isn’t that gonna get boring?"
67,Exactly. You'd be bound to go mentally insane no matter what the conditions are like.
68,exactly
69,This is at Alderson Elementary school in WV.
70,"DUEL ONE 

LET’S ROCK!"
71,Forbidden baptism..
72,when i lived in that area i drove past this all the time and it made me so annoyed bc literally who sees that and says “oh shit i better be a good boy for jesus now” like it’s just ugly and pointless
73,He turned me into a newt...
74,"Then it's fine for the Satanic Temple to put one next to it...

...you know they'd do it just to troll the Christians"
75,"Yeah the current Supreme Court can all get flattened by a bus to public benefit. They are supposed to uphold the constitution, occasionally amend it, not rewrite it."
76,That’s more like it
77,Are you all okay in America?
78,"I took it as if you do NOT dunk him, you're going to heaven because you didn't ""harm"" the teacher, and if you DO decide to dunk him, you're going to hell for being a bad guy.

&#x200B;

/s kinda."
79,"The all mighty, all powerful, omnipotent supreme being…

Gets pissy if you don’t like him/her/it"
80,"Cherish him, he's the exception"
81,Same I thought I would be singing and praising Jesus for all eternity and I always thought it would be really boring but telling your youth pastor that is a good way to have your family freak out. Come from a strict Baptist background. That shit fucked me up as a kid for years
82,All the Supreme Court will see is a private expression of his faith.
83,Wow. That’s crazy. It’s just as bad here in texas
84,"That’s probably not accidental, WV is a cesspool of religious craptitude I know, lived here all my life."
85,"They get hyper specific with the laws. In Texas there is now a law that requires IF someone donates an “in god we trust” sign to the teacher, the teacher has to display it. People were suggesting the Satanic Temple do its thing, but the law exclusively says the signs must have an image of the American flag and the words “in god we trust” and nothing more or less"
86,"> occasionally amend it

FYI: the Supreme Court does not have the power to amend the Constitution. They can only interpret it."
87,Heh.  Define okay.
88,Not in the slightest.
89,"Oop same. Baptist, but I knew I couldn’t ask anyone that. Full metal freak out, and since I was already homeschooled, there was no escaping whatever they decided I would need to do"
90,I’d still file a suit against the school district and see how many lawyer fees they’ll pay before firing the guy
91,That’s gold man. Cuts right to the bone.
92,Jesus Fucking Christ. Texas is a fucking shithole.
93,There is a group in Florida that is going to donate a bunch of signs that say In God We Trust in Arabic.  The law didn't specify language.  WOOPS
94,They can have all that on there and just plaster the rest of it with Baphomet
95,I honestly forget the exact steps of the amendment process; I thought supreme court was somehow involved in some step of it but I may be mistaken. It's not like we do it very often (for better or worse)
96,We all worry 😂
97,"This will seem crazy but the church I was brought up in actually thought I was possessed just because I asked too many questions. They would say that Satan planted the ideas in my head. I dont think Christians like logic too much. They told me I was going to hell because I denied God and that it was the one sin that could never be forgiven. Had to be publicly humiliated and prayed for, from then on I refused to go back and it really hurt my relationship with my grandparents who had helped raise me. If I ever have kids I will never allow them to step within 10 miles of a church."
98,I mean there are a lot of things that make Texas a shithole more than this particular law. :P
99,Commendable but they’ll just change the law. The Supreme Court has made it plenty clear that they’ll uphold Christian supremacy and have no requirement for equal access to religions or lack thereof
100,They should probably write it in Amharic instead
