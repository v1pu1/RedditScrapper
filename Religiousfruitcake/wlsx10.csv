1,"I'll say the (often said) obvious: These people are stupid.

And this could go well on the Childfree sub too."
2,If the purpose of marriage is just to have children then polygamy would be the norm.
3,"How about whoever wrote that post minds his own business? So many christians love to judge how other people are living their lives, but at the same time they cry about how judged they get by other people for being christians."
4,"Who gets married just for sex?

Oh, religious fruitcakes n/m"
5,how about creating a world where having a child is not a burden then?
6,"They are pretty much much say if you get married and have sex, you had best make a baby from it, otherwise sex = bad."
7,"Canâ€™t have sex with your partner you married unless itâ€™s only for making a baby! Sex is never ever for pleasure or just to enjoy your life with your partner, of course God and Jesus mandated that when they wrote the Bible.

9,"But you don't need marriage for the mighty fine pleasures of the flesh or to have kids. Sex and having kids has nothing to do with marriage esp as the original purpose of marriage was propery succession. Something that also can be done without marriage or kids now that laws in civilised cultures have changed to be more rational, reasonable and fair."
10,"Whether gay straight or neither having a child is a financial burden not saying that having children is bad, just not everyone can have children, there are real reasons people can't have children, whether it's biological, financial, mental, physical, or just not wanting kids, you can't just say everyone that's married needs to have children, that's not realistic."
11,"I think we as humanity needs to completely overhaul our view on parenthood, completely separated from all these made up divine attributes or implied virtues. It's simply a choice that is made not from any personal moral superiority or shortcoming, but from independent choice and responsibility. No baby is a Chosen One and no lineage lasts forever. They all end. 
Also, to dabble in fantasy like so many of these people often do: Humanity need to, collectively get over our ingrained delusion of immortality. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, denies immortality for all things from the sand to the stars. Only we are delusional enough to try to scale ourselves against her by trying to achieve an ersatz form of eternal life: breeding ourselves into the future. We maintain lineages just so we can pretend that we'll last along nature."
12,"I guess I love ""just nonsense
"" ðŸ¤·"
13,"What year does he think he's living in, 2022 B.C.?"
14,">I'll say the (often said) obvious: These people are stupid.

I have a question or five about their sanity too."
15,"Literally, the irony"
16,"nah, that's socialism -them

17,"Children, once they lived through infantcy, and old  enough to work, were an asset. Now we want children to be pampered dependents. For less than 100 years this has been the way as a first world problem."
18,socialism bad! just look at europe /s
