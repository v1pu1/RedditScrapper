1,"I struggle with witchcraft, it is really hard and just doesn't work right."
2,It‚Äôs obvious that these fruitcakes who are so anti-Wiccan never actually met one. Most of the ones I‚Äôve known have been peace hippies. They‚Äôre the least Satanic people on the face of the planet.
3,I read the whole thing and now have a giant urge to slap sense into the author. It's a movie. Get a grip.
4,How was what Dr. Strange does not considered witchcraft?
5,I guess they don't know where Christmas trees originated.  To bring in pagan worshippers to Christianity.
6,"lolz. religious people are always struggling with their temptations.  the bible believes in hell and demons but all these churchies think they are floating up to the clouds. jesus died to set wiccans free? sounds like someone was home schooled.  always trying to impose their morality on others who are just living a decent life being good people.   maybe as a former wiccan whose religion says you are going to hell for that, you should just shut your liehole."
7,Jesus died to set Wiccans free? Wicca was founded in the 1950s.
8,üòêüòëüòêüòëüòê
9,"A lot of words for them just to say ""I am dumb and fearful."""
10,"Sounds like this fruitcake was really a fan of marvel and Wanda before she came to the conclusion they use real demon magic and not CGI, what a shame."
11,"Ah, yes. I forgot about Doctor Strange using real witchcraft and sacrificing aborted babies to Beelzibub. I know Wanda is a witch, but I don't think they showed her black cat, extra nipples, and broomstick.  This guy claims that Marvel shows real witchcraft but if they left out some of the basics, then it's not very realistic. Now I need to stop making assumptions based on a movie I've never seen, like so many Christians do, and watch the damned thing. 

/at least some is /S"
12,Speaking as someone who knows a *lot* of pagans  ' these powers are more common than you think ' ?! ü§£ü§£ü§£
13,"As a pagan witch

That is not what we do"
14,You should stay away from that movie but not because it contains witchcraft but because it's a very mediocre movie. Go watch everything everywhere all at once instead.
15,Lol! Christians thick magic is real. üòÇIt's not! But they won't admit it because they need a boogiemanüòà.
16,"Yea. Scarlet witch is a fantasy mutant, you wont learn any witchcraft from it"
17,"Completely irrelevant to the post, but the whole ""Scarlet witch is now an actual witch"" deal kinda pissed me off. Age of Ultron put so much effort into explaining how she got her powers from an infinity stone, and now all of a sudden her powers are from chaos magic, which as far as i know have nothing to do with the stones. Kinda turned me off from the current direction marvel is going off they're gonna keep contradicting themselves"
18,Well one thing I agree with is that it did feel more like a horror movie than a superhero one.
19,"For fucks sake',.magic isn't fucking real and neither is religion!"
20,You mean you can't levitate yet?!
21,"I've known several Wiccans and they are much more easier to get along with than most Christians. Not once has a Wiccan ever knocked on my door on a Saturday morning to tell me about the goddess. I enjoyed their company and I was a Christian at the time. I just followed the golden rule and refused to judge others. If all Christians just read the Bible and followed the teachings attributed to Jesus,  they would be a lot easier to get along with. But, bigots gonna bigot. I've since come to my senses."
22,I was about to say. Also I don't think Wiccan has anything to do with satan what so ever. Following  female dietys and so on. Unhinged and also misinformation.
23,Gives me strong vibes of when my husband‚Äôs Amish/ex-Amish aunts and moms got together to burn their kids‚Äô Harry potter books. *just in case*
24,"There are also plenty of people alive today who are [older than this ""Wicca"" thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_Today) that this fruitcake is complaining about.

Religious fruitcakes frequently insist that beliefs that were invented quite recently are in fact very old. Protestant (and also quite a lot of Catholic) [opposition to abortion,](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/10/abortion-history-right-white-evangelical-1970s-00031480) for instance, and also [the whole ""Rapture"" thing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture)

Ooh, and Horror-Movie Satanism, too, where everything the Satanists do is just Catholicism turned upside down and back to front. That's mainly the creation of [Anton LaVey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_LaVey), and the writers of horror books and movies."
25,Just guessing but maybe because he‚Äôs a man. These kind of people know that witchcraft is fantasy but even the suggestion that a woman might have power over them makes them think satan
26,"She didn‚Äôt get her powers from the mind stone, it just massively amplified existing powers she already had. Or at least that‚Äôs the current canon, although I had to look it up to check."
27,Still working on the broom making.
28,"Damn you, Cotton Mathers!!"
29,"You are probably right. But my problem is that, if that was the case, then shouldn't she have been unable to destroy the mind stone? Vision said that because her powers originate from the tesseract, she can affect the stones. But if she always had the powers, or if magic could simply do the job, then why the fuck didn't Dr Strange just break the time stone or some shit? It just seems like a haphazard attempt at retconning her origin so you can get more content"
30,"After thinking about this a little more, it dawned on me that in the comics, Wanda was a mutant who eventually was able to use magic, so it's not like this jump was original. But considering i know literally nothing about Scarlet Witch in the comics, i genuinely cannot have any reasonable opinion on it. Guess I'm gonna have to take a crash course on her comic origins..."
31,"You can use a shop bought one,  honest, guv!"
