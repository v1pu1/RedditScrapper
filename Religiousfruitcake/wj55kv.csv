1,Gee I wouldn‚Äôt want to get ‚Äúrunned‚Äù over. That sounds scary!
2,i love how these type of people call others ‚Äòcrybaby snowflakes‚Äô and yet they‚Äôre the ones who can‚Äôt accept the fact that trump lost the last election and say all this shit about fraud and whatever and obsess over it years after it happened‚Ä¶ but sure. other people are the snowflakes lol
3,"Oh my god there is so much to unpack here, hopefully the comments cover it all.  That said:    
First, why the fvck is it all on a hearse?!  I mean, is it a metaphor for Trump's political prospects?  Or for the fact that [**he appears to be near death**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qult_Headquarters/comments/wb11qj/trumps_uh_not_looking_so_good_there/)?  Or for the fact that they want to extinguish our Constitutional Democracy?   
Second, what the fvck is up with that face in the rear window?!    
Third, I'm no expert on the English language, but I'm pretty sure it's 'run over' or 'ran over' and not ""runned over"".    
And fourth, "" runned over 'again'""?  When did we get run over before?!"
4,"Nobody going to point out that 20 + 24 does not equal 45? 

‚Ä¶at least I hope that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre doing there‚Ä¶"
5,"When these guys gets arrested for some terrorist act, they cry like babies."
6,"It's ""git runned over"", maroon."
7,Git 'er runned!  Wouldn't be surprised if that became their new slogan.
8,God fucking dammit devil I don't think even chaps would approve of this... Ugh I bet he's a pog too.
9,His faith is apparent by the absence of a Space Force bumper sticker.
10,"Wait, didn't the fat guy with a shredded wheat on his head lose? So, he's not staying, he in fact went."
11,"The desperate need to be better than everone else and to throw it in their faces is just beyong pathetic.    

You would probably be right in assuming this persons intelligence is as small as his ego is large.   

I bet the mindless spewing of talking points is strong in this one."
12,*Get runned over*
13,Is that a fucking hearse?
14,"Its ok, republicans dont need education... they have assault rifles..."
15,These types who scream about snowflakes themselves are usually so fragile that they fly into a rage the moment you dare contradict one of yheir mindless talking points.
16,"You‚Äôre right there‚Äôs lots to unpack here. 

Don‚Äôt worry sweetie. The former guy is being indicted and his minions are being shamed. It may take awhile. That means pain for them as well as us. But we‚Äôll be celebrating in the end and often until then. 

For now let‚Äôs celebrate the wins we have. 

Wait till you see what happens when voters actually vote. I hope we see that this November. We saw it in Kansas.

Let‚Äôs go National. 

There once was an endangered animal called a ‚Äúreasonable Republican‚Äù. I hope you meet one before their extinction"
17,"I think that face is supposed to be Nancy Pelosi, they think that she is a puppet of the Deep State or NWO (New World Order)"
18,"Alright, so I assumed that 45 is a reference to DJT (45th POTUS). This had me wondering WTF the 20th and 24th presidents have to do with it. Looked it up: Both (Garfield and Cleveland) were Reconstruction Era guys who didn't seem particularly extremist or relevant in any obvious way (and Garfield lived only a couple hundred days into his presidency anyway).

And then my dumb ass realized that ""20"" and ""24"" are probably a reference to the Year 2024. I think this was supposed to be an uhhh *artistic* way of saying ""Trump 2024"". This seems to fit with the theme going on with most of the adjacent messaging in the bottom portion of the hatch of this crazymobile."
19,Who needs education when you can just shoot anyone that makes you feel dumb?

21,"I think it's Hillary, because...HeR eMaIlS!"
22,The consensus seems to be that it's a Hillary Clinton Halloween mask that MAGA Dumfvcks wear to commit crimes while trying to throw blame for said crimes on the left/Democrats/progressives.
23,Like a second grader?
24,Ah
25,It could also possibly be a Hillary Clinton blowup sex doll.  Trump is quite clearly psychosexually obsessed with her and has been for many years.  ü§Æü§¢
