1,"The craziest thing to me is that Jews, Christians and Muslims all worship THE SAME GOD.

Yet they still fight and cause so much damage waging wars against each other for mundane things. Just bonkers."
2,People and their rights >>> imaginary sets of rules called religion
3,"And it's not even fucking true.  Hell, Muslims are the most fun to trigger because you get such a HUGE reaction for so little.

All you have to do is mention that in their myths, Aisha was 9, so Mohammad was a pedophile...."
4,I mean it's still freedom of speech to call someone out. I do find it funny though that they don't include Christian because of all the times I have heard people just assume that the left just loves Islam for some reason but hates Christians it's usually that. I do mean people usually think the mindset we somehow have is Christian bad Islam good when really most people that defend Islam are coming more from a point of seeing the hypocrisy of Christians not so much they like Islam.
5,"So, the muslim guy is pissy after someone insults his religion after he insults several other groups?"
6,"Everything is correct though? If you use your free speech to  say vicious shit about innocent people I will use mine to call you out on it. Your religion as well considering Islam is well known for hating LGBT+ folks, Jews and women. The difference is the bigot saying those things in a country with free speech will usually go free or be lightly punished but if I said anything bad about Islam in an Islamic country I would be put to death or imprisoned for decades."
7,"Insult to the first three: ""your life isn't worth as much as mine, you shouldn't have the same freedoms as I do"".

""Insult"" to the last one: ""here's a drawing of that prophet"""
8,"Same shit, just presented in the form of a comic.

And they still got the anti-semite thing wrong."
9,"First of all it's okay to criticize Judaism, anti semitism is being racist towards Jewish people, second of all yes you can criticize all ideas and opinions it's just that being a woman or being lgbtq isn't an opinion, third of all criticizing something means you must be open to people criticizing you back which is what calling you a homophobe is"
10,so relatable!! why cant i support a religion that encourages child marriage & sex slavery without someone calling me a mean word?
11,Is that... Matt Walsh lol
12,"So, they admit that they DO insult LGBT, Jews and women ?"
13,"Free speech and insulting remarks are often the same thing.  The Muslim man could also respond with ""free speech!"" ""Free speech"" does not give you an asshole pass.  I say, keep your hateful views to yourself."
14,"You can say you hate Judaism or think its teachings are wrong (most Christians and Muslims do by saying the Torah is outdated anyway). Go ahead and protest circumcision and I’ll support you. 

It’s when you accuse me of being part of a sinister effort to replace whites in a globalist dictatorship with space lasers that I think you’re antisemitic Lol"
15,"Hating a group of people = bad. 

Criticism of an ideology, religion, practice etc is not hateful. 

Saying something like “all _____ people do _____ and therefore all _____ people are bad and should have less rights” etc. is bad and hateful."
16,"Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences. You can say whatever homophonic shit you like, but don’t act like you’re being oppressed when you’re labelled as a homophobe"
17,"In my experience there's a Wheel of WhatAboutism for Christianity & Islam.

Criticise Christianity: 'Oh, so bold, you wouldn't dare do this to Islam, we are being persecuted.'

Criticise Islam: 'Oh, so biased, you wouldn't bother applying this scrutiny to Christianity, look to your own house.' 

&#x200B;

My solution. Criticise Christianity & Islam at the same time, then they have no way to deflect."
18,"The right half are a choice, this can be judged for that choice. The left half are not."
19,"His insults are also a part of free speech, tasteless but free speech."
20,"Even more so within those religions.

Shia and Sunnis hate each other just because one believes in a lineage and the other doesn't. And they both hate Ahmadiyya Muslims.

They believe in 99% the same thing, but it's that 1% they focus on."
21,People want to fight. God is just an excuse.
22,"Or they create some weird ass fucking ""alliance"" like in r/antitheistcheesecake and act like they aren't going to each other's religion's hells lmao"
23,"Because they describe that god in extremely different terms, with a completely different personality and favorite tribes/deeds attached to it."
24,And then you get beheaded
25,"Lmao yeah, I made a minor joke about ""Temples"" and even that got them triggered lmao."
26,Exactly.  Maybe it's all the brain damage from slamming their head into the ground 5 times a day?  Or maybe the rampant inbreeding?  I guess the world will never know...
27,"All this conflict is likely linked to some long forgotten political something or other that needed to create a ""hostile other"" to justify a war or oppression."
28,jesus fuck the people on that subreddit are EXTRA crazy
29,"I don't live over there, so I can write whatever I want."
30,just read through it a bit and man do those ppl really believe in the crazy bullshit theyre talking?
31,Happened to a guy in France if it’s one thing those filthy fuckers have going for them it’s Islamists are ignored
32,"Charlie Hebdo, I remember."
33,Not even Charlie Hebdo that school teacher got his head lopped off
