1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Use them to make origami then display them at work.
2,We all know that doorstep proselytizers can be annoying. I felt the same way until I found out that this particular sect (JW) requires members to proselytize. They donâ€™t have any choice in the matter. Once I found this out I certainly didnâ€™t change religions but I did become more understanding of these occasional knocks on the doors.
3,"One time my mom and I were eating at a Chipotle and this 90 year old lady approached us and asked my mom to help walk her off of this patio at the specific location we were at, and my mom oblidged because we're good humans.

So the lady comes back to thank us and she says to my mom I think your daughter would really benefit from some counseling, you know how teenagers are with their looks and hands my mom a Jehovah's Witness pamphlet. ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

Also as a sidenote I'm 22 years old. Also I'm Non-Binary but that's another topic entirely lmao."
4,Pursue peace by supporting hatred and violence towards people who are different than you.
5,"I love how I could tell it was JW just from the art. They always depict ""paradise"" the same way in all their propaganda."
6,Ask them to explain why they call Yahweh Jehovah.  If you know the history of the word it's great for a laugh.
7,"sooo...where can i get free bibles? winter could be very dire here in germany this year due to the energy crisis, and my oven could need extra fodder."
8,"Oh I got one of those last week somtime came with a nice hand written letter too, it gave me Covid burned it for good measure"

10,I got one of those last week in the mail. The weirdest part is that it was addressed to my maiden name and Iâ€™ve moved since Iâ€™ve been married and have never gone by my maiden name in this state. Super creepy.
11,This.
12,"This is true. And people's stories about being woken up at seven AM on a Saturday by JWs at the door are not lies (though they may not be *exactly* correct about how early it was :-), but sensible JWs don't do crap like that. They're *scientific* about it. Making maps, assigning areas, and completely shamelessly trying to make sure that each proselytising team contains at least one young, attractive woman, for instance.

Source: I, an atheist, lived in the pockets of a bunch of JWs in the small business that was my first job, years ago here in Australia.

(The JWs are kind of the McDonald's of religion: They're much the same, with a *little* local variation, all around the world.)

I know *all* of the bad stuff about the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society Of Et Cetera. The awful practice of Disfellowshipping, a bunch of non-optimal childrearing issues, and also the inevitable hiding of the god-damned kiddy-fiddlers that always seem to lurk in insular religions. Oh, and also maybe dying 'cos you suddenly need a blood transfusion, but refuse it.

The JWs I knew, though, were just regular people who were more *sincere* about their religion than almost all of the other religious people I've ever met.

The only one who was something of a shithead was, what a surprise, an [Elder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses#Elders)

'Cos the more willing to cheat you are, the further you can climb the ladder in any number of organisations."
13,"I donâ€™t think YAHWE is binary, even Dennis fucking Prager says YahwÃ© only presents as male because otherwise men wouldnâ€™t listen to him."

15,"Yeah you're probably right, I just mentioned that because that lady would probably try to convince me that I'm possessed or some shit. ðŸ’€"
