1,Catholics. Biggest pedo ring ever
2,"You know, I could rewrite that question and ask them why be Catholic when they can be Jewish considering that Judaism predates Christianity by quite a lot of time as well as some other stuff."
3,The Dead Sea Scrolls are Hebrew era texts and have nothing to do with Christianity.  Score another one for confident ignorance.
4,">Why would anyone want to be Protestant?

Meanwhile protestants: Why would anyone wanna be Catholic?"
5,">miracles

So-called ""miracles"" are either

1. mistaken (see the ""bloody"" communion wafers that turned out to be red mold or Hinduism's ganesh milk miracle)

2.  outright fraud(see faith healers that fake healings or people who claim divine knowledge of congregants that turns out to just be standard cold/hot reading con artists techniques typical of ""psychic"" fraudsters)

3. entirely unverifiable"
6,“Half truth faith” Lol
7,I feel like they're going to be upset when they find out what impossible means.
8,"They do have a point that only one church in Christendom can trace itself all the way back to its ancient founders…and that the rest are bogus.

But frankly the RCC today is nothing more than real estate and child sex."
9,"It's more like 1800 years old. There is no evidence of Catholicism existing around the time of Jesus' life or shortly thereafter. Early forms of Christianity were extremely different than anything that exists today. (Generally being new forms of Judaism or, alternatively, a religion which equated the god of the Torah with Satan.)"
10,That works for all religions.
11,Mathematical impossibility -> probably time to question your faith
12,Canaanite polytheism predates Judaism and is where they got their god concept so perhaps they should join that
13,They'd probably say Jesus.
14,I agree with both sides on this issue.
15,"Neanderthals liked looking at boobs and ass.

I guess what I’m saying is that consensual engagement in mutually-satisfying jiggly-bits-centered activities is the closest thing to a loving god that we can ever directly experience."
