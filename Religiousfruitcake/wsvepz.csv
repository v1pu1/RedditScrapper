1,"A public tomb?

Anyone who knows anything about history would know a public tomb would be a mass grave. That was the fate for people like Jesus.


Also, you would literally have to ignore Paul. Our earliest writings if you want to go down the other religions started with a dream route lol"
2,They claim people witnessed it but no one contemporarily wrote it down.
3,"This is just shows that they know absolutely nothing about other religions.

But hey, of course, it's a classic Abrahamic religion move anyways."
4,I thought Christianity started when a lady covered up her affair?
5,"Might almost be a decent argument. If there was any truth to it. But I could write a book for a new religion too. And I could make it say whatever I wanted. And then say it was proven to be true in my book. For example, I could write about how the flying spaghetti monster is real, and created us all. And how he came down to earth, and reveled himself to us all. Everyone say it with their own eyes, it was even on TV. 

And in 2000 years, my claim of the spaghetti monster will have just as much evidence it happened as the claim of Jesus resurrecting. IE none. As literally nothing outside the bible supports it, or even him existing at all. You can't say ""this book must be true, because it says it is in it, and it even tells me others saw it too!!!"" Not unless there are other sources to support it."
6,Would that include Jesus's religion?
7,"For the rock star of Galilee that Jesus is portrayed to be in the gospels it's strange that there are no contemporary extra-biblical accounts that he even existed.

Christians later had to insert (i.e., forge) references to Jesus in the writings jewish historian Josephus (not a contemporary of Jesus).  Because that's what christian apologists do - they rely on dishonesty to ironically spread their ""truth."""
8,"All information on the matter was written by people who were not there, long after the supposed ""resurrection"". Nice try though."
9,"Strange how no contemporary writers verify the account in Mathew of a bunch of dead people getting out of their graves and roaming the streets of Jerusalem. Seems like that would be something that someone outside of a small, obscure, Jewish sect would have noticed.

""SAB: Matthew 27"" https://skepticsannotatedbible.com/mt/27.html"
10,"Except we have no evidence that any of that was public. All we have are the words of men written from their private minds claiming it was public.

And it's odd that these were only written decades after the supposed events and there isn't a single piece of contemporary writing or artifacts for something that was supposed to be public. Especially considering how a human publicly reanimating from the dead then floating into space would be noticed by historians and writers. Along with zombies walking around town as claimed in the bible. I wonder why."
11,"Not to piss all over Christianity, but doesn’t Hinduism/Buddhism have a few religious stories that were historically recorded by emperors and record keepers of their time? Like Buddha for example actually met with other royalty and talked to them. Enough to leave a social impact.

I find it weird the story of Jesus supposedly is uber historically accurate, but not even the king mentioned in the Bible gave enough of a shit to write a letter about it. At least something like “Lmao dude this homeless guy in shitfuck city legit rose out of his grave. Dude it’s making my kingdom famous like really.” Then again it wouldn’t surprise me if there were any historical evidence if Christians would unironically burn it for heresy, because “How dare you call our prophet some homeless criminal convict, none believer! Hiss!”."
12,r/unexpectedcommunism
13,"Jesus is not real, im not saying he is not a god or prophet. He does not exist

Mohammed exist tho, but not a prophet"
14,"Christianity, at least the Old Testament, began as a tribal religion, one of many hundreds that existed at the time. Back then, each tribe had their own god. Other tribes would recognize the existence of other tribe’s gods, but would prove theirs to be the strongest by surviving. There was no concept of a “one true god”."
15,Mohammad supposedly split the moon in half what this guys on about.
16,Valid argument. Selection bias coupled with out-and-out falsehoods. How can this not be convincing?
17,This is a karma mine for a christian sub i can just feel the smell of aggressive upvotes from conservatives lmao
18,"Moses and the burning bush.... A family comes up with a cover story about being visited by an angel who impregnated a virgin.... The only accounts of someone rising from the dead is a single book.

I mean, if it *were* as public as it were, Romans would have had a lot more to say on the subject. (Unless it was the deep state! Even then, preventing the truth from being known!)"
19,"Wasn't the book of John written a hundred years after Jesus died? I know the stories would've been told orally but still, he didn't actually see any of it."
20,"The second set of pictures only really describes Islam or some very modern cults. Most other religions evolved slowly from older myths and legends becoming centralised as states arose 

Judaism is a great example of foundational national myths and legends becoming an organised religion"
21,Funny since the only source that says those things happened is the Bible
22,One person saying 500 other people saw something is NOT the same as 500 eyewitness accounts. They really struggle with this concept.
23,"Except for the fact that not one person wrote a single word about Christ during the period in which he was supposedly alive. Seems kind of strange to me. I know it's never a popular opinion but I'm of the mind that the guy never existed in any form outside the mythology that created him. He's a combination of a bunch of myths and stories that had been circulating for centuries. Of course, this assertion never ceases to piss people off but not one person has been able to provide any kind of credible evidence that I'm wrong. All I ever hear is ""scholars and historians generally accept that the man behind the scripture did exist."" to which I respond those people also most likely believe that he was the product of a virgin birth and that he walked on water too, so no thank you."
24,"At least, that's what this one book claims happened."
25,"I mean didn’t Moses open the river publicly? And he also committed a genocide and killed thousands of Egyptian kids, I assume publicly?

Or Greek gods. They didn’t even have middlemen: some of them used to live with humans.
 
Or Mohamed. People saw him talking with angels.

I mean if you want to write sci fi do your homework first."
26,Or even know about their own.
27,"Considering she was most likely still a child, it would have been a man covering up a rape."
28,"There are some non christian documents that mention Jesus. It is almost certain that there was a somewhat popular wandering jewish preacher that went by the name Jashua and was crucified by order of Pontius Pilatus.
Yet I have to admitt that all the supernatural stories around him lack sufficient evidence to be called a fact."
29,"“There were hundreds of witnesses! That would be MORE than enough in a court of law!!”

1 guy claiming there were hundreds of witnesses =/= 100 independent eyewitness testimonies"
30,"No, it was God who unleashed the plague.

Only because Yawheh may or not have hardened the Pharaoh's heart. So that said Pharaoh would rebuff Moses and God could punish him for not letting the people of Moses go despite not having much of a choice."
31,"And they fucked humans.  Many times.  Zeus banged any woman he could find, and many men.  Apollo tried to fuck men and women alike, and then they turned into plants at some point."
32,"Gods *and* titans lived with people!

Prometheus and his brother Epimetheus (both titans) lived amongst humans, which Prometheus helped create, and Epimetheus married Pandora, of Box fame.

Not really anything significant to add, just a fun mythology fact :)"
33,"For real, Abrahamic God always gave his messages for humanity privately to one prophet, who then told everyone else."
34,My headcanon is that Archangel Gabriel raped her and then had to cover it up.
35,"Nope, not from the time it happened. The earlist non christian things to mention Jesus don't come until after 100 AD. And those use the bible for refrence. And there are no Roman records of any crucifation by anyone that would fit Jesus's story at all, and they kept amazing records. This was such a problem, that after the Romans converted, a scholar noticed there was nothing from the time mentioning Jesus, and went back and forged documents about it. There is not one single piece of evidence to suggest Jesus was real on any level. Not one."
36,I know man. They gang banged me.
37,And the story of Pandora's box is basically the story of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
38,"Thanks, TIL! I wish I knew mythology, especially Egyptian and Greek, much more. Both amusing and thought provoking."
39,Based and nephalem pilled
40,"People say Jocephus mentions Jesus, but there is a lot of problems with that section. Jocephus was a no nonsense Roman scholar who for some reason in that section alone goes on briefly about how Jesus was wise and good and did miracles. Also he had a favoured way of laying out lineages which is strangely abandoned in his mention of Jesus. Also it was written in 91 AD and the earliest copies are Christian reprints…"
41,"There is no archeological evidence, nor would one expect to find some, as the vast majority of people failed to make an impact on the archeological record. 
Nevertheless the fact that there are two passages on Jesus written by Josephus, although one is heavily edited by later christians, during the lifetime of contemporary eye witnesses, and the history of early christianity written by Tacitus leave some strong indications that Jesus the man did exist.
Furthermore it would be quite a stretch to assume that a movement such as christianity started without any historical catalyst whatsoever. 

Ps: It feels really weird to defend the fruitcakes for a change."
42,"I need to brush up on my Egyptian, tbh. Mythology in general is just so fun and interesting."
43,"But there is nothing from the time to support his existence at all. There are no records from the Romans about any crucifixion that fit, or even anything they'd consider like a religious uprising of the time, nothing. And all later writers refrence the bible when talking of Jesus, and nothing else, so he may have been real because people later wrote of him based on the bible doesn't really work. 

There is nothing to suggest he was real, no evidence at all. And most goes directly against it. Many records were ever forged about him specifically because they knew it was weird even at the time, that there were no records to suggest he existed at all. Nothing at all supports him. 

Most give the existence of some figure vaugely like Jesus to them because it is such a mundane thing to say ""sure, some leader existed who thought he was the messiah. And for how Christianity started, it wouldn't need it at all. But just one of the dozens who would have claimed that would be enough to give it a shove. People follow and believe shit with no basis in reality now all the time. You really think it'd be any different then? At best, it is based on someone who did a few of the things, kind of, but again, no records of any crucifixion really hit it hard too. And show you, most of what Jesus was is just made up. There may have been a real person behind part of the story, but the vast majority of even the non miracle stuff was completely made up with no basis in reality at all."
