1,I can confirm it‚Äôs true as I am Beyonc√©
2,What the fuck did Beyonce do to piss these people off?
3,"Hi, we're recruiting for the local satanic temple, would you like to join. There's orgies on Sunday, and donuts on Monday."
4,Bible pages have zero absorbency.
5,"Welcome to the sign store, how can I help you? 

‚ÄúOk here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúI hate satan‚Äù all in lowercase, bold Helvetica or the plainest sans serif you have, the text should be a primary blue- but make the ‚Äúhate‚Äù more turquoise‚Ä¶ see where I‚Äôm going with that? Perfect. I have some Beyonc√© ideas as well‚Äù"
6,Where do they even come up with this stuff?
7,"""Sure. Just let me get my horns and pitchfork."""
8,I'd move.
9,Did they go into a Fastsigns and get that Beyonce bible tampon sign made up? If so they totally made some employee's day.
10,So the Bible is witchcraft. Cool. Also they hate Satan. What about Lucifer.
11,The neighbors should dress as Satan and knock on the door.
12,"Those fingers in my hair

That sly come hither stare

That strips my conscience bare

It's witchcraft

Beyonce uses bible pages as tampons
It's witchcraft

Yeah I can see why that verse didn't make the final draft. It doesn't scan at all.

Edit: formatting and to say formatting."
13,"What‚Äôs wrong with SATA? I know we have NVMe SSDs now, but PCIe lanes aren‚Äôt built for that many drives at once."
14,"""It is witchcraft.""

To accomplish... what?

Just *once* I'd like one of these people to demonstrate what they think magic is and how it supposedly works. I was told for decades that my D&D books taught how to cast real spells, and if so they must know a few techniques I don't."
15,"The lower level is actually the Grinch‚Äôs house. The sign was supposed to say ‚ÄúI hate Santa,‚Äù but the printer screwed up. The upper floor is occupied by one of Jay-Z‚Äôs ex-girlfriends."
16,I think they resemble a specific stereotype but I just can't quite put my finger on it /s
17,The house it doth protest too much. I bet whoever lives there sins every chance they get.
18,I wish their stance on Satan were a little less ambiguous.
19,Get a sign that says ‚ÄúI love satan‚Äù
20,I only had one thought and that was ‚ÄòFucking OUCH.‚Äô Do this people just not know how vaginas OR tampons work?
21,Wait they don't like Satin? Good for them...  oh Satan.

25,Wait till he hears what I use bible pages for...
26,Bit extreme
27,"Wait babe, I need to finish putting on my makeup‚Ä¶ alright [ready](https://punkrave.ch/img/cms/--article.jpg)"
28,Should Beyonc√© not use tampons? I am confused.
29,"That's some serous baggage to live with.

I think I aged a few years reading that much hate.. imagine having such poison inside of you."
30,thats..that's... uhm....   I got nothin'
31,I'd put a pride flag in their mailbox
32,Welcome to Philadelphia
33,Tampons‚Ä¶ not a very absorbent material.. not the bibles ive used throughout the years anyway
34," Bible paper is the least absorbent paper tampon option possible. And would you roll it up? Wad it into a ball and shove it up there?  

Wouldn't it make more sense to say that she wiped her ass with it? Maybe used it to roll up the devil's lettuce?"
35,"Congrats to the crazy religious freak, they have managed to make the concept of an HOA look good for once"
36,They spelled Santa wrong.
37,"To be fair, if anyone does manage to effectively use Bible pages as tampons, that‚Äôs definitely witchcraft. It‚Äôs not like those things are naturally absorbent."
38,![gif](giphy|4WFh45muuKV7MV3IFV)
39,Be sure to bring a gift basket full of good fruit and antipsychotics.
40,Beyonce should sue them for slander.
41,"Missed an opportunity by not going with ""I'm hatin' Satan."""
42,This is awesome
43,"Idk I can‚Äôt hate this, cus it doesn‚Äôt feel aggressive lmao. The font and such just make it feel like they are casually stating ‚Äúyep, I hate satan. Ya know Beyonce uses bible pages as tampons, and that‚Äôs uh whichcraft.‚Äùit cracks me up"
44,"I too hate sata, just kinda annoying cables, always in awkward spots at awkward angles"
45,That fecal ridden book is going nowhere near my blood dispenser.
46,"Should get into your nicest clothes then knock on the door. When they answer say:""please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste"""
47,Sounds like they need to receive a bit of good old fashioned [door-to-door proslytizing](https://www.oglaf.com/sithrak/)
48,Let me guess: United States of America
49,Would be such a shame if somebody covers part of the last a to make it an i
50,"Their car also had a similar message, at least a few years ago. Not sure if they still do, but I‚Äôve seen them driving around Philly in the past"
51,"‚ÄúBeyonc√© uses Bible pages as tampons‚Äù

Sir/Ma‚Äôam wth are you on"
52,[deleted]
53,I want these kinds of drugs.
54,"If I lived next door to them I'd be tempted to decorate in large fake tampons with Bible verses written on them.  Along with little [dancing devil iights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEjvXK-3bGM) on every fence post.

edit: Told my wife about the yard decorations, she said we'd need a billboard for Jesuspax tampons as well..."
55,FINALLY! A good use for the Bible!
56,I love satan
57,‚ÄúHi neighbors I‚Äôd like to talk to you about our dark lord and savior Satan.‚Äù
58,"I hate satan. He's red, doesn't wear clothes, and gets everywhere."
59,"""I hate all fictional deities"""
60,What kind of ritual you can perform by using Bible pages as a tampon? And on what kind of paper are their Bibles printed on?
61,Please someone change hate into hail. It's just two letters...
62,Hi we are satanists and we appreciate diversity and accept differences :)
63,"Now, now... Jesus said it's not good to harbour hatred in your heart. Just ignore Satan and don't do bad things, hmm?

(But I'm pretty sure you can flip Satan the bird now and then - behind his back, naturally...)"
64,They shouldn‚Äôt be mad that Beyonc√© is resourceful
65,Honestly those people would be a reason to look for a new place...
66,I feel like Bible pages would be a very ineffective tampon
67,How do they know what brand of tampons Bey uses?
68,"She‚Äôs not witchcrafting, she‚Äôs lemonading."
69,"I mean, given the tampon shortage what else is Queen Bey supposed to do?"
70,They seem nice  /s   üòÜ
71,I can confirm this is true as I am a Bible page witch-tampon.

81,Any way we can get the donuts on Sunday too? I‚Äôd hate to make another trip.
82,Yeah I'm just over cringing at the thought of using Bible pages for tampons. Like ... It would be next level ineffective and disgusting üòÖ
83,You have just given me a business idea
84,And they're so full of shit that that can't be hygienic either.
85,"It'd be like using Zig-Zags for a tampon. Sharp, thin af. Very painful. That's why all my friends get free zealot books and use the paper for just this occasion!"
86,I feel like Bible pages would repel the streaming menses or sloughing of tissue from my uterine lining. I guess it depends on if it‚Äôs wadded up or folded.
87,r/suspiciouslyspecific
88,"""Ma'am, 'Satan' is a proper noun. Are you sure you want your giant sign to be grammatically incorrect?"""
89,They probably use 'satanic books' like Harry Potter as tampons
90,To be fair she does say it in lemonade
91,Good luck with the showings with that shit next door
92,They think the 7 demon lords are all one. Hell all the other pantheons as well. All Satan apparently.

100,"Dude, if you shove Bible pages covered with printers‚Äô ink and the germs of countless fingers where the sun don‚Äôt shine? You WILL have poison inside you!"
