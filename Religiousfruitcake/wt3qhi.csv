1,"Oh fuck this is such a great grift.   All you need to do is convince people to give you money, there's absolutely no follow up"
2,"Yes ma’am I assure you I am a homosexual satanist…


Your animals will be safe with me."
3,I so wish the rapture was real. Can you imagine what a utopian society we could build without church interference.
4,I sincerely hope this is satirical but if not where do I buy into the franchise?
5,Só we'll be left in a world without bigoted theists and with all the pets in the world for us to pet? SIGN ME IN
6,Someone is laughing all the way to the bank!
7,"It started as a joke around 2011 I believe in the wake or Harold Campings end of the world prediction, but apparently someone grew a more or less legitimate business out of it: https://aftertherapturepetcare.com/frequently-asked-questions/
They charge 10$ for sign up and then your pet will be taken care of after you are raptured."
8,Easiest money on earth XD
9,GOD DAMMIT! Our clients actually got raptured and our Jewish staff got vaporized by Jesus... Are the Baha'is and Buddhists still good to cover weekends? You know what happened the last time we had the Muslims and Hindus working the same shift. The atheists have already worked 35 hours and if they work any longer we have to pay benefits. This is a Christian business and we can't afford those!
10,"> mind if I pay you AFTER the rapture?


(The boyfriend of my niece was adamant that the end of the Maya calendar was the end of the world (remember that one?). So I made a bet:

- if it's true, I pay him a fancy restaurant 

- if there's no mayan end of the world, HE pays me a fancy restaurant 


He never saw the irony... never paid me the restaurant either... sorry, but these people deserve to be exploited...)"
11,Okay who wants to start this business for real with me? I'm serious message me let's do this let's profit off the ridiculous beliefs of Jesus freaks
12,This has been around for quite a while and I’ve always wished I thought of it first.
13,I plan on hiding under the coffee table that day. I’ll be available to cuddle some kitties
14,"Sorry dude, under no circumstances am I going to “heaven” if it means I have to leave my cat behind. That sounds more like hell to me. 

Quick, I’m gonna go sin a bunch so I don’t have to worry about being torn away from my handsome floofer boi."
15,Ya I should do this too. Take all the money and donate it to the FFRF
16,This is a nice con business to get into for atheists :)
17,This is brilliant. Lol!!
18,Is it $9.99 per pet or is it a flat rate?  What about cleaning and getting the mail?  Sounds like a great racket!
19,"They can't trust non-Christians to be their neighbors but totally cool with them looking after their pets when they've been ""selected"" to go to heaven. 

Makes sense."
20,"Man, this is a good idea! Just take pics of your friends and say they're your staff. 10 bucks a month from even 25% of them would equal a nice chunk of change. You're basically just doing what their pastors do to them every Sunday. Or every time they watch their televangelist con-men tell them jebus wants them to donate their savings. Why not take a small cut of that! It's chump changed compared to what the pastor has exploited out of 'em. My grandmother gave several 100k of inheritance to one of them."
21,I’m actually here for this one. Scam these fruitcakes out of their money lol
22,"That is bloody genius, can I invest?"
23,"Hey, this is my side hustle! You won’t believe how gullible the Evangelical’s are.

/s"
24,This is brilliant.
25,Wait am I reading this wrong? Non-christian or atheist CATS????
26,"> bust most importantly to insure that they are either Atheists or Non-Christians

… uh, are they trying to say they “ensure”? Because “insure” doesn’t exactly make sense."
27,I wonder how many staff are currently on the payroll.
28,I wonder how Angela Martin would feel about this.
29,Finally! A scam I can get behind.  These people are geniuses.
30,"You mean I CAN’T bring my cat to heaven with me ? Fine, I’ll go to hell then. Wherever he goes, I go."
31,This is just a tax on idiots
32,"How do people still believe in the Rapture. There’s constant predictions. Each one passes, then they make a new prediction. It’s silly."
33,I kind of wish I thought of this.
34,"Mad Max kind of deal,with 30 cats, 20 dogs and a gold fish named Satan."
35,I’m pretty sure this was a scam started to capitalise off the hunting rapture scare
36,This legit makes me so sad. If Heaven doesn't allow my pets in then I'm not going
37,This is a fascinating scam. I applaud whoever thought this up l.
38,"If they were good people, wouldn’t the caretakers be raptured too?"
39,"Dont worry, my cats christian. he can come with."
40,Where do I sign up to join the team
41,I can't get angry at the person running this gift.
42,Sign me up. I want some of that sweet rapture money
43,Reddit satire detection (impossible)

Hitting a new low in religion"
45,An atheist definitely made this.
46,R/atheistsidehustle
47,"Atheist vegan here, ready for my new career."
48,Wasn't this a troll during Harold Camping's whole thing?
49,Hold up this is fucking genius.
50,Some athiest somewhere is making a killing off these people. XD
51,"God loves His animals so I'm pretty sure they'd just go with their owners...(just my beliefs)

Definitely all kinds of religious fruitcake. This honestly looks like satire and I want to believe it is."
52,Isn't this satire?
53,$10 ain’t bad 🤔
54,Number doesnt work
55,"Still maintain this is the greatest low effort scam of all time and I congratulate whoever game up with the idea. No need to even follow through on anything, the true definition of passive income"
56,"The Christian church wants me to trust my kitty with non- Christian atheists. This church is telling pet owners there pets don’t matter. All pet owners now wish the wrath of 10,000 rats will plague your Christian homes until the Rapture begins."
57,"Non Christian here, so I'm a bit confused. In the rapture, aren't all the good Christians the ones who go to heaven? So if they aren't hiring atheists or non Christians... Who is left? Lmao they're cool with leaving their pets with shitty christians?"
58,This is full on genius.  It's not like they can complain that they've not been raptured yer
59,this could go on r/surrealmemes
60,"If the caretakers are also Christian, shouldn’t they be raptured to?"
61,">love of animals

They're going to fuck my pets, aren't they?"
62,Genius grift
63,"Hell yeah, get that bag."
64,"You might also want to add on that everyone that works for you are vegan, in order to really drive home the love of animals.  Obviously, no one actually needs to be any of these things, they just have to be willing to lie to dumb people to make money off of them, which, unfortunately, is quite the hurdle to overcome."
65,"Oh, this is just fucking genius"
66,Ooh! That's my area code!   Nice to have such great amenities in the area!!
67,Where do I sign up as a franchisee?
68,"Hats off to the people behind this, because this is a class a grift right here"
69,"The person who ""invented"" this, must be on this subreddit. What a fantastic way to earn money on these people 😂"
70,Atheists ARE non christians
71,This HAS to be satire.
72,"Every time I think the world is not getting as bat shit crazy as it appears m, something like this comes along."
73,"clicked on this expecting it to be r/shitposting, wtf"
74,"#Cause we're not going to Heaven, and neither are your pets!"
75,This was started by atheists fyi and made a good bit of money.....I think they were shut down tho
76,Local phone number. I want in.
77,"This is actually brilliant. Take advantage of people's delusions to encourage them to give us, the logical people, money we could more productively use."
78,This looks like a poster during the 2012 rapture craze
79,Brilliant
80,Part of me really wants this to be real. XD
81,I would 100% absolutely work at a place that promises to take care of people's pets after they've been raptured.
82,If this is true it is amazing. Respect to whoever came up with this business idea.
83,"Even if this is a joke, this is actually mega profitable. I can just take money from gullible Christians each month while doing nothing!"
84,One of beauties of capitalism babeyy xD
85,How do I sign up for this job?
86,why didn't I think of this grift
87,Aren’t we sinners supposed to be degenerate baby killers? How can we possibly be trusted with Fluffy and Mr Whiskers?
88,This keeps getting reposted but it’s a joke aimed at people who believed Harold Camping’s prediction about the world ending in 2008
89,"*starts to slowly laugh, then goes full belly laugh* ah....I wonder how many suckers would fall for this 🤣 🤣 🤣"
90,Genius alert!
91,Has anyone called the number to see if this is real?
92,Easiest $10 ever made
93,I tried calling but it was busy. :(
94,Wait - you mean all dogs DON’T go to Heaven?
95,My mom gets sucked into shit like this. Gullible as.
96,Does the pet comes with the house of the owner? I'm in
97,This is a genius way to make money with nothing but marketing costs.
98,How can someone possibly know? Ahahahah I'm sorry I'm genuinely curious
99,Stable income for life
100,"Wasn’t the outcome of the rapture supposed to be that all non believers would be swept into hell instantly? Maybe I’m remembering this wrong but i feel like the whole urgency behind the rapture in 2012 was if you were an atheist you were supposed to be killed by the earthquakes and tsunamis that followed the Christians being levitated up to heaven, this seems like a huge waste of money beyond the sense of paying for something that won’t happen"
