1,A studying person is being put in prison for enjoying basic human things. Wow. We need ways to protect these women from this and prevent children from being born into these beliefs.
2,For following and retweeting. She didn't actually say anything?
3,Poor girl. She basically got stolen of a good chunk of her only life.
4,I think this is more to do with politics…I recall a while back a reknowed religious guy who was put in prison (still there To this day) and his family exiled from Saudi and stripped of their possessions because he publicly tweeted he wished for peace between Qatar and Saudia arabia…how dare he use religion for actual peace?!
5,"Once a woman escapes Saudi Arabia, why the hell would she ever go back?"
6,"Again muslims showing why they have the best religion.

/s"
7,"....and people portray me as an asshole for criticising Islam. ""It's not nice"", they keep saying.."
8,"This is their way , this is not news"
9,The leader of the free world really need to intervene here
10,Why would anyone that got out ever visit those countries again. I understand the need to see your family and stuff but come on.
11,Why did she even go home?!
12,"not for *only* using twitter, according to an arabic news website she was tweeting about something political but they didn’t mention what it is specifically."
13,UN human right counsel y'all right here.
14,"She's not sentenced for using Twitter... Otherwise all Saudis using Twitter would be in jail right now.

Going to prison for following and retweeting certain people is already fucking insane, no need to lie to make it more absurd. Not to mention, a proper headline would make people think about (nonexistent) freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia, but now all your title does is ""lol goofy ass Saudi Arabia randomly imprisoning people on Twitter""."
15,Wow - with laws like that here in the US we’d never have to hear from the Kardashians again
16,Why does she look like rebecca black?
17,"Can I like do some Muslim voodoo and wife her or vouche for her, as a male person? I totally would, just to let her not be in prison."
18,"To be fair, there’s probably a lot of people on twitter who should be sentenced similarly"
19,"I look at this in America, and am scared to death it won't be long before the Christian version of this is happening here. When was the last time you heard a republican go on about how bad Shria law is? They were just jealous they weren't allowed to do it, and now they are getting their chance."
20,"Sad thing is, right now, it looks more likely these kinds of things will be spreading. I am an American, and with how things are going, if we don't stop the republicans, America will be doing the Christian version of this in not so long."
21,And it sounds like she did it while she was not in Saudi Arabia. They decided to imprison her for something they didn't do in their country?
22,"Oh, it’s much worse than that.  She’s likely to be raped and tortured for the entire sentence. Either she commits suicide or comes out a completely broken human being."
23,"Visit her family, maybe."
24,"You can get the same treatment in China if you are associated with dissidents and activists. Islam and the way it is practiced has its flaws, but  this is probably about politics."
25,She probably missed that whole Jamal Khashoggi assassination business. Visiting family in Saudi Arabia can be a death sentence.
26,"Yea, coz **that** makes the prison sentence OK..."
27,"She's going to jail for using Twitter.  Doing the normal things people on Twitter do.  Following and retweeting people.

It's like saying she's going to jail for using a Hammer when really she's going to jail for using a Hammer to put a nail into wood.  Which is exactly what people do with hammers.

It's the same thing."
28,"Don’t know why you are downvoted. It’s a fair comment. It’s not that she used a hammer, it’s that she bashed a skull in with one (according to the idiots in charge). It’s nonsense ofc, but the article’s title is pure clickbait and unnecessary exaggeration of the case. 

She should be able to criticize without going to jail, ofc."
29,I've noticed as well. I'm worried for this world.
30,The Saudis are garbage human beings. It’s disgusting that western nations do business with these monsters.
31,"Oh I know, it was somewhat rhetorical. 

I’m just saying, if I had finally escaped Saudi Arabia and didn’t share their values, I wouldn’t even walk to close to their embassy. Nevermind setting foot on Saudi soil."
32,"yOu cAn gEt tHe sAmE TrEaTmEnT In nAzI GeRmAnY If yOu wErE AsSoCiAtEd wItH DiSsIdEnTs aNd aCtIvIsTs. ToTaLiTaRiAn aUtHoRiTaRiAnIsM AnD ThE WaY It iS PrAcTiCeD In cHiNa hAs iTs fLaWs, BuT ThIs iS PrObAbLy aBoUt eCoNoMiCs."
33,The US isn't that far off. Depending on who ends up in the white house next.
34,"never said it was, obviously it’s not okay. i’m just explaining what actually happened she didn’t get jailed for *just* using twitter."
35,"So if Biden starts retweeting some Nazi arguments and his ratings drop, that means his ratings dropped for using twitter?"
36,"Very much so. We still have a chance, but it is slipping away and things could get dark for a while if we don't act."
37,"But we need oil. Which is exactly why we need to go green. Everything we need is already there. The switch could be made completely in just a few years, with no issues at all. Only good could come from it, but sadly, too many refuse to do the right thing."
38,"Had you taken as much time to understand my post as you did to mock it, you might have realized the meaning in the context of this subreddit."
39,"Lmao fucking ***what***

Like don't get me wrong the US got some real issues but to think its anywhere even within the same reality like the shit in this post is just about koala levels of smooth."
40,Lmao what an exaggeration. No chance in hell they're close to jailing people for murder charge amounts of time for using fucking Twitter.
41,"He says, freely"
42,"LOL Straight to Godwin's law.  

We're not talking about opinions, we're talking about government action.  People's opinions shift depending on how someone says something.

Governments shouldn't be as fickle as the political populous."
43,Use /s no one can hear your tone across thousands of kilometers of fiber optic cable
44,"<sarcasm>The GOP is working on it.<\sarcasm> Now leave me alone, I need to go make a tinfoil hat."
45,"Way to focus on the insignificant dumb shit rather than address the actual point.

Replace Nazi by any other reprehensible political ideology if Godwin's Law bothers you so much.

The point of comparison was not government action vs political or social pressure (which you are arguing against and no one argued for). It was normal use of social media vs endorsement or amplification of political opinions, with social media.

Making the case seem like the woman was jailed for use of twitter paints Saudi Arabia as some erratic government that could imprison anyone using twitter. That means even people sharing cat pics on that website can be jailed, since the use of the website is the apparent crime, and not something else. This is some unprecedented event that cannot be used in any overarching political advocacy, except if your sole political goal is to make Saudi Arabia look bad.
Add the context of the case, and now you have a completely different image of a government that has a clear pattern of imprisoning dissidents and opposition for voicing their opinions, and a clearer path to solve that (e.g. repealing the specific anti-free speech laws that she broke, adding free speech clauses, etc)."
46,"Im not sarcastic. I just don't think that this is a case of religious fruit cakery just because saudi arabia is an islamic country, but a case of someone oppressed by the saudi monarchy as it is indicated by the interaction with dissidents."
47,">paints Saudi Arabia as some erratic government that could imprison anyone using twitter.

They obviously can if you click on the wrong button on Twitter.  Like someone they don't?  That's jail time! lol

Nothing here makes Saudi Arabia look anything more than some backwards shithole."
48,"Politics and Islam are inseparable hence sharia and caliphates Islam acknowledges that it tells you how to rule politically

The dissidents and activists that she retweeted weren't just calling for the fall of the monarchy some of them were just tweeting out memes that made fun of Islam"
49,"We agree then, all you care about is that Saudi Arabia looks like a shithole."
50,"If this was true, christianity and politics were inseperable as well. Well, maybe seperated but equally important as it was in the medieval ages.

It all comes down to persons deciding which parts of holy books and teaching they believe in and whether they accept power structures based on these elements."
51,"Nah, just pointing it out.   Saudi Arabia IS a shithole. 

They just sentenced a woman to 34 years for something she did on Twitter.  Not even something she said herself.

Saudi Arabia will lock you up just for pointing out Allah is some made up bullshit.  

If you don't think that's fucked up, you need to do some soul searching."
52,"Nah I used to be a Muslim Islam specifically says it is to be used for managing politics while Christianity is the cobbled together writings of some hippie Shepherd's apostles

53,">Saudi Arabia IS a shithole

Thank you for your originality and bravery, smart redditor. I'm sure that country will be a better place as a result of your comment.

>If you don't think that's fucked up, you need to do some soul searching.

Back to pretending that you care about the issue, rather than just insulting those backwards barbarians."
54,">Thank you for your originality and bravery, smart redditor. I'm sure that country will be a better place as a result of your comment.

Nothing I say or do will make Saudi Arabia any less of a shithole. Not sure why you'd think it would...

&#x200B;

>Back to pretending that you care about the issue, rather than just insulting those backwards barbarians.

I'm insulting those backwards barbarians because they're imprisoning a woman for decades for liking a twitter comment.  That's just fucking stupid and anyone in Saudi Arabia that agrees with it is a caveman.

First they made up a god and then they punish people for pointing out it's all bullshit.  Barbarians is right."
