1,Hi Incel!
2,This wad of used loo tissue must be in a *very* happy and stable relationship
3,"1. Am I seeing it correctly that this dude is retweeting his own shit?

2. Actually looked up the verses he mentiones and I have no idea how tf you come to interpret them that way? 1st one is ""gay bad"" and 2nd one ""don't fuck someone who isn't your wife""?"
4,This one must be quite the wife beater. I hope he doesn’t procreate.
5,"Thou shalt not useth the term ‘alpha male’ unironically, for it maketh thou look gross."
6,Only a true alpha retweets his own incel tweets.
7,Sad way to think and live
8,"""Alpha masculinity "" probably gets his jolies by masterbating to hentai.  No woman would want him."
9,His sort need to be extinct.
10,What an incel lol I am sure his mom feeds him while he sleeps in he basement scratching his ass the whole day
11,Kinda funny how he’s just describing tpe bdsm which if I had to guess he would not see as very holy
12,"How ""alpha"" are you if you have to complain on the internet how your wife isn't acting properly?"
13,I wish him a long and uneventful virginity
14,"When we eat the rich can we add this guy, as a treat?"
15,"Of course he’s called Alpha something. It’s always the self-identified Alphas.

Can’t expect someone parroting an erroneous behavioural study of another species to comprehend human social interactions."
16,"Well I can say one thing for sure if I ever treated my girlfriend this way my parents would be deeply ashamed.  Relationships should be based on respect and equality in my opinion as well as trust.

If you treat your partner anywhere close to the way this person describes. First acknowledge your an asshole. Second watch as your partner hopefully leaves and makes everyone around you see that your  a massive joke of a person. Whose need for control  destroys relationships better than words ever could."
17,"Ah yes, the alpha male who is intimidated by self respecting women.


In his case men and women aren’t equal, he needs a weak woman because he’s a weak man, a strong woman next to him makes him feel puny.
He is the lesser, not an equal."
18,He obviously never read songs of Solomon or 1 Corinthians 7
19,"Based on his tweets, I’d say that’s unlikely, unless he can reproduse asexually."
20,Chadian 13:6-9
21,I don’t want to get E. Coli though
22,"Unfortunately for our big alpha male, only females can engage in parthenogenesis, and in vertebrates only a few snakes and lizards have viable results. Maybe he’s a female reptilian in disguise?"
