1,Isn't that The Punisher logo? I don't think it means what they think it means.
2,"""Kill them all, let my dad sort them out""        
-Jesus"
3,I think they've confused their God for Odin
4,"I used to think the whole ""death cult"" thing was a bit of an exageration.

But look at how they talk about war, and the soldiers who die in it, and how they responded to covid, and how they talk about the potential for women to die because they couldn't get an abortion, and how they talk about school shootings. It really is a death cult."

7,"Punisher logo...

Frank Castle would have murdered all these scammers.  Give me a freaking break."
8,"I’ve fought in 2 wars, didn’t see god there at all"
9,So Polemandrotheism (Warful-Man God-Creed).
10,“Do you swear to the almighty punisher Larry and Ethel?”
11,"Yahweh is a God of war for the Israelites. Not Americans. 

Jesus though, their other God, admitting that they believe in 2 Gods, isn’t."
12,"As a white male, I've never understood the urge of other white men to war, or segregate. Or the almost compulsiveness to believe everything I'm told. Life is so fucking weird sometimes."
13,A jellyfish?
14,"Is this a reunion of the band who bought us ""Jesus Christ is my N""?"

21,The stupidest people I have ever met they call themselves Christians

23,Punisher has killed MANY a religious zealot.
24,Fucker in the middle is Darren Bailey and is the Republican nominee for governor of Illinois.
25,Religious d bags and cops really really need to let go of punisher .  Poor guy wants nothing to do with either of them.
26,The lord is a new name for the Punisher?
27,"For those who don't know: Punisher was intended by his creator, Gerry Conway, to be a parody/satire of 70s-era vigilante characters. The whole ""I only kill bad guys"" schtick is meant to be hypocritical, rather than ""noble."" The only thing that makes him different than any villain is that the people he kills are (in his estimation) ""bad guys."" 

The character exists in contrast to figures like Spider-Man who, while also working outside of the law, are self-aware enough to know that they may make mistakes, and murdering somebody by mistake is a generally bad thing. 

Conway has since disavowed the direction that Punisher has gone in, and those who use his symbol like this. Even the comics have fairly explicitly shown the Punisher himself disavowing his symbol's use by cops. 

This is tangiential, but I am starting to feel that Marvel should just retire the character. Do one last Punisher story, at the end of which he realizes that he really hasn't helped anyone and his whole ""war on crime"" was just for himself and his petty grievances, and that's that."
28,"Is that the certified nutcase known
as Darren Bailey in the middle there? The same current gubernatorial candidate who wanted to “move on” after the July 4th parade shooting?  
This fucker will ruin Illinois if he gets elected"
29,"The Portuguese Man-o-war is the perfect analogy for god. It's not a single organism, but a colony of organisms pretending to be bigger than they really are.

It's like they're agreeing that their God is 3 priests in a trench coat, rather than a diety."
30,These people sure love big Spanish ships
31,"A jellyfish??
Hehehe"
32,All Jesus wanted was to get his dick sucked and this shit-eating fools turned him into a martyr.

38,I thought this was a grimdank post for a second and was kinda confused
39,"Apparently, he's a man. He's a man who's omnipotent, yet he needs others to fight for him and they use the same weapons as everyone else and have the exact same success rate."
40,"Indeed. The lord is an imaginary monster 👿 
Read through the OT with your eyes open."
41,Christianity is a death cult
42,So lord asking for wars ?
43,Who the hell are these people? What denomination of the cult is this? Sicken.

47,Sounds like a metal band

49,Not the Punisher symbol
50,"For one thing, he kills every child molester he can find, so if he existed and knew about all  of theirs it would look like he was waging all out war on them."
51,"They're religious people, they dont need understanding or critical thinking skills... they have faith and desperate ignorance, which makes them superior..."
52,Nnah compared to christian god odin is peacefull
53,"Not really. In the Old Testament, God goes by two names : El and Yahweh (Jehovah is a misspelling of Yahweh). They are different gods in the ancient Canaanite pantheon. El was sort of their Zeus, Jupiter, or Odin, the god at the head of the table.

**Yahweh was the war god**. He was the one who required blood sacrifice for the absolution of sin. He was the one who asked for circumcision and the slaughter of all people and animals in conquered lands. 

There is a hypothesis that the Hebrews became henotheistic (rather than polytheistic) when Yahweh led them to conquer the land of Canaan. In the Bible this is when they escaped Egypt; however there's no historical record for such a large exodus of enslaved people from Egypt. The more likely story is that a smaller group from Egypt merged with diverse peoples living in the hills surrounding Canaan and took over. They rewrote their history to blend the two groups into one shared story. The histories of the two groups blended together into one shared story.

It wasn't until the Babylonian exile, when the Hebrews had to find a way to rationalize the destruction of their temple which God had promised never to destroy, that they became monotheistic. If their god could use another people to punish them, then he must be the only god. 

Additionally, in Babylon they were introduced to Zoroastrianism which set up a duality between good and evil. They rewrote and recomplied their books to fit this new ideology, and we call it the Old Testament.

So no, they're not confused. They're originalists."
54,"Lord of the Gallows, and they do love execution"
55,"No, the christian god Yahweh is the Israelite god of war and storms."
56,Or for a jellyfish.
57,Or a jellyfish
58,"Their entire purpose for being is to look forward to death because that’s the goal they do everything to work toward. They are EXCITED for death, and pray for the end of the world and for our entire species to go extinct.

Of course they’re a death cult, and you can’t ever explain to them why looking more forward to death than enjoying the time you have in life is bad"
59,"They actively wish for Armageddon so they can go ""home"""
60,Ar first I thought that Punisher logo was a jellyfish and that was genuinely the point of the sermon.
61,"Exactly what I thought...

My next though was the old style battle ship"
62,"I mean Jesus isn't a second god, he's the son of god and all his power comes from his dad, but fuck what does it matter"
63,But only for people who look and act exactly like them
64,Yep it sure it...
65,Is that his wife next to him?  Why does she look 80yo
66,"He gunned down criminals that came to meet CPT America on peaceful terms in one of the comics. 

Man has no chill for evil/injustice."
67,The ranks of pastors are about to get a lot thinner!
68,"Perhaps he has a higher body count, but he's not by any means a god of war. The aesir are literally war deities, Odin demands entrance to his hall be paid by death in active combat."
69,see thats why I regret not taking a few religion classes in college. now I have to listen to podcasts
70,"I don’t get it. Because a temple that their god promised not to destroy was destroyed, they concluded that the god whose temple was destroyed was the only god? Was the temple to Yahweh?"
71,"That's my whole problem with pascal's wager.

If god exists and you don't believe in him \*and he turns out to be the Christian god you go to hell.

It's incorrect that if you follow their religion and are wrong nothing bad happens. You get a lot less out of the only life you have. Which is infinite value in the sense that it's your entire existence.

And of course, as has been pointed out by many before me, and it's besides the point, but it also ignores that even if there were a god, there are a billion other possibilities besides it being the one Christians or Muslims believe in. For all you can tell your outcome may be far worse for worshipping theirs than not believing in any."
72,"Don’t forget the fact that their *core* doctrine celebrates human blood sacrifice. It is, by essence, a cult of human sacrifice. It has become a part of their language as well, “the blood saves you”, “you must be covered in the blood”, “drink this blood and eat some flesh.” This is all incredibly dark and belies an obsession with death. Not even getting into how messed up the scapegoating idea of vicarious redemption is."
73,"The Gospel of John in my opinion shows that’s who ever wrote this Gospel, thinks Jesus is God,

Now, the Trinity didn’t exist during this time.


The Gsopel of John shows who ever wrote this thought Jesus was God but not Yahweh. 2 Gods

It’s interesting because during this time period many different sects spawned the belief Jesus was the good God and Yahweh was the bad.

Of course Mark,Matthew and Luke show more of a adopted Jesus but John is a different thing. 


It matters because it shows people are making things up that don’t match with scripture"
74,So not Jesus
75,You see! Christian one just doesn't call himself god of war. But he is way more brutal. Also valhalla is way cooler than christian heaven and is the prime example of how religion is made for the need of the people
76,"I hate the way history is taught by history teachers, so I got all my history credits through courses cross-listed with religious studies. Best decision ever! I may have taken a few 4000 level classes where 1000 level ones would suffice, but they were so much more interesting and useful. Definitely worth the extra effort!"
77,"What I described is one hypothesis for how Judaism became monotheistic. No one knows for sure since a lot of the action predates written records, comes from tiny snippets of preserved writings which were edited and recomplied numerous times, and was written, compiled, and edited by people who thought of history quite differently than we do today. I'm also leaving a bit out since I don't remember everything exactly and don't want to misstate anything. I learned about it more than 20 years ago. There has probably been new information added to the shared body of knowledge as well.

Have you ever heard of fire-and-brimstone speeches referred to as ""Jeremiads""? This is because of the Book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament (or the 2nd Law of the Prophets for Jews). Jeremiah was a prophet known for angry, accusatory speeches on God's behalf declaring that he was punishing Hebrews for allowing sin to run rampant in their lands.  [Jeremiah 6:18-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Jeremiah%2b6:18-23&version=NIV&interface=amp) is a perfect example. 

The way this ties into monotheism is that it is a change in the way they thought of gods. Before, it seemed that each city/people had their own gods. The Jews had only one since he declared himself jealous and made them promise to have no other gods before him (10 Commandments), but they still believed other gods were real. It's like how I'm an LSU football fan and would only ever cheer for the Tigers and wear purple and gold to a game, but it's not like I think Bama or Georgia players don't really exist. 

Back to the story... Now suddenly, their god is helping another team to hurt them. The Babylonians are praying to their gods, but it's the Jewish god who's answering their prayers. He must really be their god, too. 

Again, I can't overstate the influence of Zoroastrianism as well. The exiled Jews spent 70 years in Babylon. Multiple generations grew up with their culture and beliefs. Zoroastrianism helped them see the world as a war of opposites. Instead of a pantheon, there are just 2 gods - one good, one bad. If the bad one is rewritten as a fallen angel, suddenly all the history and mythology is recontextualized. Everything makes sense again.

**Note :** The Book of Jeremiah is quoted quite often by modern preachers to insist their flocks promote legislation against liberal human rights such as birth control, abortions, and LGBTQIA rights. When some asshat televangelist like Pat Robertson says something ridiculous like Hurricane Katrina was caused by gay Mardi Gras, this is where he's getting it from."
78,"I kind of take the approach that we already have gods that we can literally see, study, and owe our existence to: stars.

Forget about an intangible concept of a god who floods the world or turns people into salt or inordinately punishes them for little things, you want to feel the true fear of god just look at Betelgeuse or think about how the beginning and the end of time itself revolves around stars or that if our calculations are off or we aren’t considering an as yet unknown variable, a random coronal mass ejection from our own star could knock out all electronics on earth sending us back to the Stone Age with only an 8 minute warning.

All this to say I’m not religious at all, I don’t care, but it is kind of intellectually amusing to think that nearly all the things religions talk about their gods doing for us and how they created us align with what stars actually did, down to our bodies and most celestial bodies being made of stardust. And no matter how much we study them they’ll always have that aura of unknowability, that air of mystery that we’ll just never be able to wrap our brains around.

Pretty cool actually"
79,"My own wager is related to Pascal’s. There’s an infinitesimal chance that the culturally appropriated Christian god is real and that Jesus is the only way to him and he gives a single shit about what I believe about him. But even if he does exist, it’s still irrational for him to be so divorced from the world and I especially don’t want to be anywhere near his most devoted followers in any afterlife, so they can just enjoy their abode in the sky by themselves on the unlikely chance that they win the stupid lottery."
80,Did you watch Midnight Mass btw? Def adds a twist to the whole “drink of my blood and eat of my flesh and you’ll have eternal life” thing
81,That's so interesting I never knew that
82,"So fan fiction offshoots, although  icon stan fiction would be a bit more fitting."
83,"Of course not!

Jesus was brown!

That's why they only pick out the bad parts of the old testament."
84,"He actually might have been a war god while the Jews were still polytheistic, though…"
85,"Valhalla kind of sucks, tbh. You wake up, fight brutally to the death, and then repeat for eternity until Ragnarok.
And it's not really comparable to Christian heaven. Alfheim is closest to the Christian heaven by description"
86,What implies it’s the Jewish god answering the Babylonians’ prayers?
87,"The SUPER SUPER unlikely chance they got it right out of the at least 9,000 other deities thought up in human history"
88,"I haven’t seen that, I’ll have to look it up"
89,"YHWH was indeed the Canaanite War God

https://youtu.be/MlnnWbkMlbg"
90,Yup. Ans christian heaven is just praising god for all eternity. Lame and boring
91,">What implies it’s the Jewish god answering the Babylonians’ prayers?

That their god, speaking through the prophet Jeremiah, said he would destroy the temple to teach them a lesson. 

Look, I'm not a religious person. I don't think a lot of this stuff makes much sense. However, if you believe with your whole heart that god is real and made you a promise not to destroy your temple, but then it gets destroyed.... you have two options. 

Door #1 : Stop believing in god because he obviously isn't omnipotent, omnicient, and omnibenevolent (or, you know, real).

or 

Door #2 : Find some way to justify it to yourself so you can continue believing anyway.

Unfortunately,  very few people choose Door #1."
92,It’s on Netflix. It’s great
93,That would certainly help explain why he came out on top…
94,"That one sucks too but I personally would rather be bored every day than slaughtered every day. Folkvang is where it's at tho, that place rocks"
95,"That’s what I figured, but I didn’t wanna jump the gun by immediately assuming there was no reason for them to think that aside from that it’s beneficial to them."
96,Idk in vahalla you can also feast. Which is fun. Who doesn't like food man
97,You can feast (and fuck) in folkvang without having to be chopped into bits over and over again tho
98,Hmmmm fair. I agree for this. Now but do they have giant anime girls?
99,For the Vikings that was a perk.
100,"Well they have giants, so it's not impossible lol"
