1,"Ah, the benevolent, merciful Abrahamic God, killing innocent animals for someone else's sin (which isn't even a sin btw)"
2,Almost on the level of a kid with god-mode in a sandbox game type of petty & nasty.
3,This looks like satire
4,Don't forget about the thousands of starving children in *Name an African country*
5,"Yeah, if God killed an innocent dog because someone else was something (not even did, just was) that God didn't like, guess what? God's the bad guy."
6,"""God killed me because you ate shellfish!""

There. Fixed it."
7,I love how these are supposed to convince people to be heterosexual and christian but all they convince me about is that god is a piece of shit.
8,"Fucking Jesus, he always ruins the party."
9,Roffo deez NUTS
10,Ey I love mxrmods. And lol
11,Why would you worship a god who kills your dog because you like men’s asses
12,This “God” fella sounds like a real prick.
13,Are we sure God didn't kill the dog because the guy mixed his clothing materials? That seems more believable.
14,"I never understood people who reply ""It was all God's will.""

Like, that guy seems like a asshole, no?"
15,"Ah yes, the omnibenevolent god. The god who loves everyone. The god specifically designed to be the embodiment of love.


That god? 🤣"
16,![gif](giphy|AfaM5q2MGzqiQ)
17,"That dog killed itself;  I would too, if somebody named me Roffo!"
18,"Jesus Fucking Christ, your dad is a straight up dick!"
19,I can't understand how someone can look at this and not immediately come to the conclusion the intention is that God is an abusive asshole.
20,And God gave cats nine lives so those little bastards could stick around and torture us.
21,"This is abuse. Whoever it's directed at, this is abuse."
22,"And there we have it, folks. God is an emotionally abusive asshole."
23,God sounds like a dick
24,Any god that kills a child's pet as punishment is a total asshole unworthy of worship.
25,"They would kill your dog in front of you and then turn around and say that.  I’m so tired of God, in every form I’ve *ever* seen, he’s a fucking lying cocsucker.  We don’t need God anymore, it was a tool developed by humans to stave off existential fear. We’ve grown up as a species and invented science since then, out with the old already."
26,Is this a chick tract?
27,That boy’s god sucks.
28,Fuck you \*kills your dog\*
29,Please let this comic be satire.
30,God is a fucking asshole then
31,Kind of want to get this tattooed on my chest.  It's sort of awesome.
32,When you rise from the dead to say your owner is homosexual and then die again
33,This is from a Howard Cruse comic: Billy Goes Out. It is not some version of a Chick tract.
34,Genuinely funny ngl
35,"This propahanda is really demented, disgusting, bullshit that can really damage the psyche of the kids they feed it to. Effing mental child abuse."
36,"This is as plausible as the Medical Medium guys story about how god's HR person came down and told him to diagnose people. (over the phone for hundreds of dollars).  He initially refused and his dog was tossed into a river until he agreed.  Not very nice of God, is it?  Plus, if you die, it was too late for you and you should have called sooner.  Right crock o' shite that is.  I laughed hysterically after reading that."
37,Do you think “god” is a doctor by some chance?
38,What did doggo do?
39,I don’t think OP knows what “diagnose” means.
40,This is the funniest shit. Gay people have healthy dogs. It’s not like god can randomly kill animals just because. Otherwise he’d probably kill the animals that don’t obey his humble followers.
41,"This is painful now. 

May the abrahamic lord have mercy on us, and stop the assault on the senses. 

My heart weeps for the gays though. These nutjobs just won't leave the gays alone."
42,"So God punished him for something God himself is responsible for? Ah sorry, my bad. I forgot that homosexuality isn't a naturally occurring sexual orientation, but a *lIfEsTyLe ChOiCe*."
43,"Ngl, this shit is pretty fun when your fast scrolling through reddit. Immediately knew what sub this belongs to without looking lol."
44,This is the funniest religious meme I have seen in a while
45,"Didn't go all the way down the comments, so someone else may have mentioned something like this, but didn't see it. But why be mad at the guy in this situation no matter how you look at it? The dog clearly knows and understands it was god who killed him. This would be exactly the same as being mad at your rich owner for being rich, because a robber shot and killed you while robing the place. Not a logical way of thinking here. Though, no one ever said religious people were capable of logical thought."
46,I honestly don't think I've ever seen a more brutally honest depiction of the stupid shit that religious conservatives believe.
47,"Obviously God didn't kill that dog. Polycephalic (two-headed) mammals don't live long for a variety of physiological reasons - none of them mystical. Also since dog's can't talk, that's likely that boy's inner dialog, which means his parents and community are filling his head with harmful nonsense about his sexuality. In place of medical treatment, I wonder what religious BS they've told him about the difference in the size of his left and right arms."
48,I am a gay Christian
49,"Ah, yes, r/MxRMods my favourite conservative christian subreddit."
50,What the fuck?
51,on a side note this is fucking hilarious if you assume it’s a shitpost
52,"W hat
T he 
F uck
That's right Hatheuck"
53,So I’m probably going to hell for laughing over how ridiculous it is.
54,So God is only loving when it fits their narrative of convenience. What a bunch of fucking douche bags.
55,"I want to see a peer-review study that proves that God kills your pets if you're gay faster than if you're not. Also, does it have to be openly gay? What if someone is acting straight by being in a marriage with opposite sex? Is God fooled then?"
56,Homosexuality isn't a sin?
57,"You  missed the point of the cartoon. It means if your dog dies, you're gay. That's how you know.

Straight people's dogs disappear to go to a farm upstate."
58,"Oh shit, thanks for explaining it. I thought they killed it by having aggressive gay sex with the dog."
59,"God is Love 😍      
       
Meanwhile, at God's house: 🔫💥🤬☠️💀⚰️⚱️🤢🤮🦠🥵💊💉😡🗡️⚔️🔥🔥🥵🔥🔥📛🧨🎇🥀💀💀💀"
60,Isn’t this literally what the flood was?
61,It's based on a translation error. Properly translated it's a sin for man to lie with a male child. The child part was the only area where they used a different word. It's basically a rebuke of the greeks practice of pedophilia.
62,"Are you saying God's actually a child and just sees Earth as a sandbox game?

It all makes sense now..."
63,It is
64,"Its a bit funny too, the pointing finger and everything"
65,"Yes, of course, it's satire... UNTIL YOUR DOG DIES BECAUSE YOU ARE GAY!"
66,Don't worry at least they *blessed the rains down in Africa*
67,Nailed like the fuckin romies
68,im guessing this is implying that gays commit bestiality.
69,Dog murdering pos
70,"He's not my favorite, he's ok enough I guess but every time there's something that could even remotely be seen as involving lgbtq+ people he acts pretty mockingly towards them and it isn't fun."
71,"""God is the biggest dick that doesn't exist.""

~ Rick Sanchez"
72,an asshole*
73,"'Whoops, John Wick's after me!'"
74,"Death by close association with 'divine criminal scum.'

Doggo had to go, there was simply no other way for the pestilent & all-powerful lol. 

What's a god to do, forgive people for imagined slights & not sacrifice scapegoats? Nah."
75,"What's the diagnosis (through knowledge), doc, logagnosis (word ignorance)?"
76,It's definitely a sin otherwise nutjobs wouldn't go crazy about it
77,"As a certain animated Reverend once said while holding up a Bible, ""Have you ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not allowed to go to the bathroom.""

It's also noteworthy that Jesus didn't mention it once, which is weird given Christian obsession with it, not with something the New Testament mentions hundreds of times, namely the poor."
78,"Christianity defines it as a sin. But if we define something sinful as being ""evil"" or ""immoral"" then homosexuality is not a sin."
79,"The word ""homosexuality"" wasn't even coined until 1895, plus it's not even obliquely described in the Bible.  Religious leaders LOVE to try the ""man shall not lie with another man"" nonsense, forgetting that ""lie"" can also mean ""fib,"" and at the most, that verse would only refer to horizontal sex.

Then they try the Romans verses, forgetting that those were written by the people who created the SPaul character in the Bible, not Jesus.  SPaul directly contradicts a lot of stuff Jesus supposedly said."
80,"Nope, and it *can't* be a sin by any reasonable definition. But tell that to a conservative, and… well, I’d say ""they lose their mind"", but I'm not sure if they even *had* a mind to lose in the first place."
81,It’s not
82,😮😮😮
83,😭😭😭😭😭
84,r/brandnewsentence one would hope
85,"That sounds all wrong

Ed: Greek pederasty dates back to 4th c. BCE; Leviticus is from the 7th c BCE"
86,"Yeah, I've read about this."
87,More of a videogame based analogy. I might have been thinking of Minecraft & Villagers lol.
88,r/worldbox
89,I thought so. Glad to see it confirmed.
90,"It feels like a play on Davey and Goliath, too. Even though the style is different, boy with moralizing, talking dog friend is the structure."
91,You sure? Because it looks an awful like a chick tract
92,"And if you're level 1 homosexual, then you would kill not just your dog, but yours neighbor's dog. And the canary."
93,Yeah same. I do appreciate all of the blatant copyright infringement tho.
94,Baba Jaga isn’t around to tell god to run ..
95,"If you don't sin Jesus died for nothing,  go be gay for Jesus's sacrifice"
96,"You better not be eating shellfish and wearing mixed fabrics you harlot /s

Lots of arbitrary shit is a sin"
97,"so is getting excessively drunk, many others are, they never go crazy abt that, its also picking and choosing, in the worldly eyes to them its the biggest sin, but god said love your enemies lmao, show everyone compassion but people pick and choose"
98,That sounds like heavy-duty load-bearing sarcasm.
99,Well I suppose if you think about it nothing's a sin since a sin is breaking the rules god set and God isn't real buuut that's if you want to nit pick. which I don't think oc was doing.
100,Christians see *everything* as some sort of sin or another.... And *everything* except persecuting others and grand standing is of the devil....
