1,So why don't men cover themselves with a hijab?
2,"As always, when men harass women it's always, always the woman's responsibility to see that it doesn't happen."
3,What a fucking lunatic. When I see a woman in a hijab i feel nothing but pity.
4,“Your Reddit avatar isn’t wearing a hijab” 💀💀
5,"…Haven't some countries banned the hijab, though?"
6,This has to be a joke. Lmao.
7,"it’s a copypasta, though it’s no different from the way muslims think"
8,"Wooow this is a whole new level of madness, avatars have to use hijabs as well??"
9,It's a copy pasta lol mostly spread around edgy Muslims teenagers.
10,Someone's turned on by reddit avatars
11,That's why there's a huge porn sub dedicated to 'hijabis'
12,"So then men are weak, according to him. Men are simply incapable of rational thought or self control, according to religion."
13,Tbh I think that’s satire
14,Looks satirical
15,Don’t want to be harassed? Hide.
16,It's because God commanded it so (he's misogynistic)
17,"Because Muhammad told them to grow beards.

You are suppose to grow beards because Muhammad thought it would prevent homosexual thoughts.


Who else but a 7th century desert man?"
18,"Because women don't have sexual desires! They are half brained (src: Quran/Hadith), disguises of devil (src: Quran/Hadith) who can never be as good Muslims as men (src: Quran/Hadith), most of which are going to hell (src: Hadith) and oh yeah that's why FGM is a thing in Islamic socities (src: Islamic practices and end texts)"
19,Well I guess that’s kind of a relief to know it’s not real. Also still a fucked up thing to respond with to a post about harassment
20,"Welp, they sure are making the best off the situation"
21,Nah-na-na-ne-naaah naah!
22,"Seems ineffective, some of my gay as hell friends have magnificent beards."
23,"When we were in the field on exercise, we were dressed head to toe in camouflage. Helmets, body armor, back packs, face paint, and all the rest. Somehow people, gay or straight, managed to get attracted to each other and have sex anyway."
24,Now that's a story I'd want to hear.
