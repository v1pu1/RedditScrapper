1,Weird how they didn't notice the demonic energy until *after* they learned the person was an atheist
2,"""I knew he was evil the moment he told me he was evil according to my rational and not at all wacko beliefs!"""
3,"Oh no, pseudemonic dramatics, they're decidedly doomed!"
4,"Fucking atheists.

They could be out protesting for the removal of people’s rights, or diddling kids, or stoning women for letting themselves get raped, or running schemes in mega churches to defraud already poor people, or preventing young girls from learning how to read and get educated, or forcing circumcisions, or forcing people into servitude, or doing genocide.

But instead they’re helping little old ladies at the grocery store which is obviously a distraction so they can summon demons."
5,"""Cold demonic being"" = ""My held expectations and beliefs were challenged"""
6,When my mother's mental illness intertwined with evangelicalism. She became a shit show like this. She'd have horrendous mental breakdowns and had hallucinations of like being filled with her god's power and having super powers. My childhood was a fucking  mess.  I feel sorry for every person in this fruitcakes path. My mom died of covid. It brought her peace from all the horrors religious folks did to her. Even childhood Catholic sexual abuse.
7,"Christian shocked that atheists can actually also be good people, has her own way of interpreting what happened"
8,"Moral of the story?  Don't help Christians. 

God helps those who help themselves.    Load your own damn water."
9,"So an atheist demonstrated altruism unmotivated by fear of hell or the rewards of heaven? That sneaky devil-atheist, how dare they challenge your preconceived notions."
10,Not a hot sweaty demon ? Just a cold demon
11,"Funny how if he just lied she would've ""felt"" absolutely nothing"
12,"Notice that by their own admission they didn't feel anything until after he said he was atheist.

The feeling is entirely a product of prejudice against atheists and not some sort of divine detection skill."
13,"Prayer warrior is such an annoying term, trying to sound like a badass that takes action when what you mean is you sit there and think about what you want from some imaginary super powerful being."
14,"The first sign of possession is a strong feeling of cold dread.  Followed by paranoia.  I recommend a hearty tumbler glass of inoculating jalapeño juice, followed by a daily 10K jog for three weeks.  Remember, if you stop jogging before the 10k is up the demon will catch you!  /s"
15,I love how these people never 'feel the demonic presence' until AFTER someone TELLS THEM they're an atheist. It's almost as if your assumptions about someone make you feel unsafe...
16,"This is the kind of shit that makes me hate christians. They are so full of shit, I dont know how they get a word out without choking on it"
17,"Correct me of im wrong but isn’t it impossible for demons or the devil to posses people who follow the word of god

Otherwise god would be a pretty shitty deity"
18,">prayer warriors

If it's the same prayer warriors for Trump's 2020 re-election or anti-vaxxers on ventilators then that demonic being from the frozen food section has nothing to worry about."
19,">“Immediately I felt a cold demonic being”

Oh, honey, that just your prejudice kicking in. 

The call is coming from inside the house on this one."
20,"So he goes from a nice young man, to an atheist, to a demon in 5 seconds?"
21,And this is why you don't help theists. They're delusional assholes.
22,Its amazing and sad that apes this stupid are capable of using technology to this degree
23,"So... God doesn't think you should fear the Devil, but insists that you fear him.

Don't be afraid of the Devil, but do be afraid of God.  Is that right?

Are you sure you're worshiping the right guy?"
24,These people subconsciously enjoy being afraid.
25,"I'm dying, this shit is hilarious!"
26,Interesting that the demon waited until he announced he was atheist to latch on to her
27,All of us atheists need to band together and pray to satan to offset what their prayer warrior army is trying to accomplish.
28,I'm afraid cause someone was being nice that doesn't follow my religious beliefs!!!! 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹💨
29,"This is at least a third of what's wrong with the country. Sometimes someone helping a human out is just someone helping a human out.

Who profits from a third of the population being stupid and afraid?"
30,What happened to the (now-unholy) cases of water?
31,"I saw a homeless lady living in a blanket fort/tent outside a CVS. I went back and got her some food. 

""Thank you, Im a christian too!! 😃"" she goes.

I didn't reveal my true identity of abortionist-ally-antfia-socialist-supersoldier. In her precarious state I didnt want to burden her with thoughts of the pack of demonic hellhounds that follow in my wake."
32,"Yeah, the cold demonic being was in the rear view mirror. If only she had looked."
33,Help other people with thoughts exist!!!!
34,An atheist who believes in demons. That’s even harder to believe in than a demon!
35,So you felt a cold chill as your preconceived notions of what atheists were like were challenged so you went outside and reinforced your beliefs to make you feel better?
36,What’s this? A kind act from a non believer? Must be demons!
37,Funny she couldn’t feel that demon before he spoke. Almost as if it’s all in her fruity head.
38,She is the demon.
39,"Had he never told her he's an atheist, she would have thought him a lovely person for just helping her. Instead, he gets called a demon. That was her reaction to the word 'atheist', not a freaking demon.

Sheesh."
40,PLEASE 😭😭😭
41,Boo!
42,"I just ... Ugh I feel so bad for these people. They have nothing. Their world is so small. 1 word and all of a sudden their mind conjures demons. No wonder they are angry and terrified all the time, it's just so much fear."
43,Imagine the insensitive shit she must have said to that kid
44,WHY are so many people in America this stark raving mad????? They seem to be everywhere and nobody calls out to stop them.
45,"Yeah, that cold demonic being? We call that cognitive dissonance."
46,“Immediately I felt the years of religious trauma Pavlov me into being terrified of the word atheist”
47,"My mum is a evangelist & she talks like this.

I actually believe it's schizophrenia."
48,As an atheist one of my prime directives is to live a more pious and virtuous life than Christians.  It's surprisingly easy as the majority of them aren't even trying.  It's like they get to sin all the time and just ask for forgiveness and that just makes their moral failings all okay somehow... WACK!
49,Good! 😈
50,So *that's* how it works.
51,I know a lot of people who actually think like this.  It is so fucking bizarre!
52,If I had to sum up the Christian experience in one word that word would be fear.
53,"As an atheist, I have had people react this way."
54,"Best discard that water, that's now been infected by the demon's pizzle."
55,Please let them keep on with this 'demon' horseshit.  It shines a spotlight on what utterly primitive dickheads they are.
56,"If this story is true then it's really sad in my opinion. 

Imagine being so heavily indoctrinated into this anti-atheist dogma that you enter a state of shock and paranoia whenever you see one.

She sounds like she needs help."
57,"That's a killer last line.

""I know God told me to fear not, but I am afraid.""

In a better context, like some book, show or movie, that could be a fuckin' slayer of a line."
58,"It’s funny she thought that the atheist was conjuring demons… lady, the man doesn’t even believe in demons"
59,Must be weird to live in that kind of fantasy land.
60,0-100 in a matter of a second
61,"There is an awesome story from the Jewish Talmud that talks about this concept that I love to share it, as an atheist that teaches in a Christian University.

 Talks about the reason that God created atheists, and the gist of the story is that God created atheists who  open doors for old ladies, put their shopping carts, and do other acts of good. The explanation is that atheists do nice things for others with no expectation of heavenly reward . The Jewish talmed teaches that we should look to these people as inspiration because they are doing things out of kindness for no heavenly reason.

 An atheist that goes out of their way to be kind, fully understanding and believing that there is no God, that there is no higher power is far more good than someone who is doing it for the expectation of a reward. Boom. Atheism for the win. We good people yall"
62,Imagine living in that much fear

64,"I just joined the Satanic Temple, I hope I get an opportunity like this so I can see the old crone have a heart attack when I tell them I'm a Satanist."
65,"You know... Food for thought here...

You aren't really, truly under the assumption that everyone around you shares your beliefs if you are constantly in the habit of reaffirming them with strangers around you."
66,"""Cold Demonic Beings"" could be a great band name"
67,Helping people is an integral part of any satanic ritual to summon demon spawn. Every atheist knows that.
68,Imagine if we acted that way when they told us they were Christians? It would be much more deserved.
69,"The truly scary part is these people feel it's ok to say this ~~batshit~~ demonshit crazy stuff aloud!

When people start spewing all this nonsense I just assume they are mentally unstable and start backing away."
70,Being a nice person has nothing to do with being atheist or Christian. It's just being human. A Christian will not think or post that non-sense. That's just a person believing to be a Christian. Big difference.
71,I hope the kind atheist boy helped you with your bright red nose and oversized floppy shoes you fucking clown ass dummy.
72,"Religion = ""Socially acceptable"" voluntary schizophrenia"
73,I wish I could summon a demon. I must be one of those powerless atheists.
74,"These idiotic zealots can vote. This whole religion changing America’s politics shit going on right now has made me come full circle from hating all religions in my edgy teens, to thinking that they aren’t that bad it’s only a few crazies in my early 20s, back to hating all religion in my jaded early 30s."
75,"""I'm afraid because someone I've demonized was nice, thus shattering my belief that me being a christian makes me superior. PLEASE PRAY!!"""
76,"That unsettling demonic feeling you've got? Yea that's no demon, that's your prejudice and entitlement lmao."
77,"Why would you even insert religion into a situation like this?    Have you heard of ""Thank you?""  Try that next time.  ""Thank you."""
78,"I'm the atheist in this situation, but something similar happened to me about a decade ago.

On my way home from work, i see a black Honda Accord on the side of the road. The lady driving could have been my Mom. Same car, same haircut. It wasn't, but it could have been.

I pulled over, and she just needed her tire changed. She had already sort of started the process. The trunk was open and she had her jack out, but was stuck getting the blown tire off. 

It wasn't a hard fix; The last thing i did was put the blown tire in her car. She thanked me in a way similar to the post from OP. ""Thank god for good Christian men like yourself."" Oh, sorry maam, but god didn't have anything to do it with. I'm actually atheist, but  You look so similar to my Mom, i felt inclined to help.

She looked like she had seen a ghost. She looked frightened like i was about to assault her, when i was changing her fucking tire not 60 seconds ago.

I hate people."
79,r/brandnewsentence
80,Mental illness.
81,"Oh grow the fuck up.
You dont have to make shit up to hate people. If you take 15min to get to know somebody, I **GARUNTEE** you will find a reason to hate them."
82,How does this woman get out of her house
83,That. That’s how satan gets ya. Water bottles.
84,Yes. I am a cold demonic being. Your advance age has made you very astute. Would you still like help with this water you fucking nutter?
85,You only feel something after they tell you their atheist
86,Lol what an idiot
87,These are some very dramatic people. How is she going to rebuke the devil and go against what god says in the next sentence ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)
88,😳…….🤣😂😅…….Brainwashing should be ILLEGAL
89,Guy’s trying to demonstrate that you don’t need to believe in a God to be a good moral person by helping someone in need and the God believer turns out to be a brainwashed nut. Go figure.
90,How dare the atheist be a nice and good person
91,This person would rather be attacked by demons then allow themselves to feel awkward and examine her own beliefs.
92,INB4 she probably has undiagnosed schizophrenia
93,What a weak minded fool. I have a rainbow and a leprechaun for sale if anyone has his contact information. Also for sale is a piece of the cross Jesus was nailed to.
94,Prayer warriors hahahahahah
95,"Atheist here, I actually stalk old ladies to help them with various deeds. I also volunteer at soup kitchens and church services. It's not because I enjoy being a good person, I'm just hoping to spread the demonic plague to as many people as humanly possible. Hail out master Satan, praise the new world order, and may we all be bathed in the life extending blood of innocent children."
96,Why don't you ask Santa Claus to help you? Or maybe tighten the tin foil hat tighter to your head. Are we going to let these morons decide our fate in America? VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! and cote democratic! The right probably sees her as a viable supreme court candidate!
97,![gif](giphy|3o6Mb8udBESmFAVwQg)
98,"Helping strangers out with random acts of kindness = good atheist boys.

Helping strangers out by turning their water into wine = good christian boys."
99,“Christians are being persecuted!”
100,"Atheists, with the fact of them lacking a belief in an afterlife/salvation, should be lauded even more for good deeds since they essentially are being benevolent without any end reward. Theists should be feared since one of the only reasons they’re even being good is because they feel as if they HAVE to."
