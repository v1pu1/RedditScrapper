1,Why doesn’t SHE stay the F* home and STFU? Lol
2,"This is very easily explained.


You hate women."
3,"I would explain it to that hateful idiot, but I doubt she'd understand."
4,"Perhaps she should find a venue more suited to her philosophy.   Religious tracts,  town callers, the Spanish Inquisition?"
5,"While her tweet was sexist and stupid, I don't see how it causes or encourages violence or harassment. It's a fucking stupid opinion, but not a dangerous tweet."
6,Well its nice to see that some of the right things do get removed from Twitter!
7,If she actually read the Bible she would learn that she isn’t supposed to read the Bible.
8,"It was deleted bc she's a woman and not allowed to have an opinion. Who does she think she is mouthing off like that ?  Its blasphemy!!  She needs to gobrepent and her lord and savior for forgiveness.


/s"
9,"women are being forced to leave the home by capitalism, a single person cannot support a family. you need two earners to stay afloat. 

men were forced to spend less time at home when we switched from an agrarian to industrial economy...because of capitalism (I know they just mean bipoc fatherless homes, but the point stands)

Now that we've established ECCONOMC PRESSURES ARE TO BLAME FOR SPLINTTERING FAMILIES. Now do you think they'll talk about raising the minimum wage and supporting unions and universal health care and childcare and ~~education~~?"
10,*What an uppity rib she must be.*
11,![gif](giphy|3o7TKzyWlCxCQ5R8fm|downsized)
12,"What the hell? Who hurt her so bad that she thinks that unironically? And if she doesn't think that unironically, who's holding her at gunpoint?"
13,"The answer to her question is no.

I could easily explain the removal of her tweet to an at least moderately intelligent person. ""the policy is against discrimination, including by sex and gender, you told women to stay in the home and be servants.""

But I couldn't explain it *to her* because I doubt anyone can successfully explain much of anything to someone like that."
14,Doesn’t The Transformed Wife actually have a traumatic brain injury or something like that?
15,"She thinks human is defined by gender and that her definition of human is defined by a book that clearly states that women  are defined as  people.  It doesn’t fit her narrative.  At least, from logic, no matter the gender, biblically,  a woman is a human.  And equally should be treated as such.  So much BS and picking and choosing.  They’re like wild chickens picking each other’s heads apart for the sake of establishing eating each other.  Big picture,  they eat each other.  I feel like it’s just too much for them to consume.  The failure and propaganda that has consumed them. The realization that they hitched a heavy wagon to a weak mule that had no intention of leading them to water.  That’s a big deal for them.  The idea that they spent hard earned money to support him and then realize he was a grifter, a liar.  And  many continue.  Sure, his words resonate with the religious right.  Televangelists do the same things.  He’s a snake oil salesman.  He’s selling something that he can’t deliver.  He’s a liar.  It’s right there.  He’s telling you what he is.  I really hope he does serious time in a federal prison for the damage he has done to our democracy and how he damaged this great nation."
16,"Should a woman, by her own reasoning, even have her own social media platform and dare tell other people anything? She's just a woman /s"
17,Finally twitter took some action against her
18,"What is ""culture tanking"" to these people?"
19,"I’m having a hard time believing she’s capable of nourishing. 

Also is it just me or do a lot of fundies like the word “nourishment” a lot?"
20,"This censorship is too harsh, let it be shown what she thinks about women..."
21,10 bucks says she doesnt even follow what she preachers. Just expects others to.
22,"Hmmm, Vichy France vibes.

I don’t like it."
23,I mean censorship is always bad so it shouldn't be removed. Let this rot on twitter
24,"The message is moronic, but I'm really surprised it could get banned... The banning seems over the top..."
25,"I'm not religious and I do not agree with anything this woman says, but I can't help but think it's a shame that she can't express her opinion on a platform that is the digital equivalent of the public square.   
I think this opinion is very regressive, but I don't see it advertising hate or violence."
26,No!
27,You have no idea why women were created dimwitted twit want you to stay at home handle your own family be under your husband Stam hope he never leaves it for someone else and shut up nobody cares what you have to say that transform wife my ass you just the same old piece of crap from 1885
28,Just reported this account.
29,So I recall in a psych class discussing attraction and the whole idea was that men look for fertile women and women look for men that can provide. If this wasn’t just a white patriarchal theory and was true then capitalism screwed it up. So if the right wants women to stay in the kitchen like assholes they need to adjust capitalism. So what’s more important to a conservative man?
30,"These religious nuts apparently see women as little more then baby incubators for their husbands. When they're not making babies, apparently the best they can hope for is servitude to their husband."
31,"Humans developed ( or were 'created ') to survive.  There are no reasons to believe otherwise. 

We are close to rats on two legs.

Or example, Women's arm bones are not curved to facilitate carrying an infant  ( hilariously said to me!)

Men are every bit as capable as women of raising children  (breastfeeding excluded)

We just don't have those gender related specialisations.  If we did,humanity would have died out before it really got started. 

Men who couldn't gather,  women who couldn't hunt were less useful to their band than an all rounder. And certainly wouldn't survive alone. 

 Christians who follow the OT slavishly are unable to understand the messages of the NT."
32,I do not get the 1984 reference? Orwell did was not concerned with this topic in that novel.
33,Women are the nurturing care takers. Men are the protectors. It's in our DNA and how we have survived for millenia.
34,The very book and church she is getting all this from tells women to be humble and quiet. Tweeting out to a bunch of people all the time is hardly following that.
35,This woman would be shocked when she lost her tongue for stating any opinion in Gilead
36,My exact sentiment
37,"Easy to explain in general, yes.

But she said ""can someone explain it to me"" that's nearly impossible. I doubt I could manage to explain anything to her."
38,She should join forces with Chick tracts. Call ‘em Chicks Against Chicks.
39,"I think it's interpreted as harassment on the basis of gender. Yes, it's an opinion, but you could also have the ""opinion"" that it's the jews fault, you are w/o work - you will also get this blocked when you put it on twitter and I think that's a good thing"
40,"Feels like I had to scroll too far down to find this comment. While I have nothing but contempt for the lunatic in question, it's hardly promoting violence, is it?"
41,"Yeah i reported someone for using phrenology to misgender celebrities (basically... every woman celeb is a man bc of head shape. Every male celeb is a woman bc of head shape).

Apparently didn't violate shit

Edit: sorry to circle back to the post at hand, it's objectively grosser than Lori but yeah at least twitter sometimes does something"
42,"Why do you hate free speech? First I cannot say the n-word and now I cannot attack women as well? It is a slippery slope, I am telling you."
43,Atheist here with no knowledge of Christianity. Would you please explain what that means?
44,Unironically that's probably what she did and is doing.
45,She purposely sabotaged her birth control so she could have another kid and quit her job. She also says it's wrong to divorce your husband if he beats you. The woman is vile.
46,Why does it seem over the top? It *does* violate Twitter's TOS regarding discrimination and hate speech towards women. All of her tweets do.
47,It is hateful though.
48,"Yeah, unfortunately I’m reeeeeallly gonna need that “/s” because holy shit"
49,"There were plenty of badass female leaders that existed in history, y’know (in case this isn’t /s)."
50,"“It’s in our DNA”

Yeah no. There’s zero biological or genetic basis for gender roles. I’m a college bio student, I know what you’re saying is bs"
51,There is literally almost no biological basis for gender roles
52,"will, not would."
53,Praise Be. Under His Eye.
54,"You can explain anything to somebody else, but you can’t make them understand it.  That’s on them, and unfortunately those with closed minds don’t want to understand.  As the saying goes, “My mind is made up, don’t confuse me with the facts.”"
55,Obviously its because she was online mouthing off instead of cooking dinner for her husband.  She has to delete the tweet and repent.
56,she failed elementary level english you can't teach her anything until she goes back to kindergarten
57,"The only words they understand are 'jesus', 'mysterious ways', and 'blind faith'."
58,Only because she would try to argue every point in your explanation. She doesn’t want someone to explain it.
59,"Not disagreeing that it's a good thing, but harassment needs to be targeted and an actual individual. You can harass someone based on race or gender, but you can't really harass an entire race or gender."
60,"Thank you, I was sure I'd get downvoted into oblivion"
61,"Virtually all social media shows extreme favoritism to the far right, sadly. The number of times I've seen leftists banned for reposting and criticizing right wing content while the original poster goes unpunished..."
62,"She hates free speech.  She doesn't think women should be allowed to have it, so it was taken from her.  She's angry but its on her for not  doing what she claims she was put here to do.  She wasnt put here to tweet her personal opinions in twitter.  She was put here to serve her husband and pray to her lord."
63,"and then even if twitter doesn't ban you, you get canceled by the 13 year olds

it's terrible! other human beings using their free speech against me? I can't stand it any longer! didn't their parents tell them that criticizing people makes jesus personally send them to hell while chastising them the whole way?"
64,Next they'll be telling us gay is okay!
65,"1 Timothy 2:12
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she is to keep silent."
66,She sounds like a piece of shit!
67,"That's my point: moronic, discriminatory, insulting but I didn't see the hate/violence.

Glad Twitter reacts but if the rules are unclear, I'd be afraid they go after reasonable anger (eg anger against sexism or racism...)."
68,"How?   
Again, I don't agree with her view here and I don't know anything about this person beyond this one post.   
But what is said in this post that promotes hate?   
It promotes a social view that women shouldn't do much beyond what she's saying they should do, but it doesn't appear to be hate."
69,"And they were the outliers. There were plenty of feminine men, too."
70,"And, I'm guessing you believe men can be women and vice-versa"
71,"Weird. I'm pretty sure, based on biology,  that men are stronger, faster, and have more risk taking attributes."
72,May the lord open
73,">mysterious ways and blind faith 

An awfully convenient pair when it comes to explaining away Gods problematic side, those two…"
74,You wouldn't call the treatment of Jews and Roma before WW2 harassment against a group?
75,"lol I just saw your response. I said essentially the same thing and am getting downvoted on it too.   
Even got called attempted being edgy for saying it."
76,It already started! Now they are talking about some 'trans' thing. My middle school biology textbook from 1958 never mentioned anything 'trans'!
77,That doesn’t mean she can’t read Bible
78,[https://fundamentalists.fandom.com/wiki/Lori\_Alexander](https://fundamentalists.fandom.com/wiki/Lori_Alexander) Enjoy (if that's even possible). Twitter should ban her permanently.
79,I would say that attributing the downfall of civilization to women not being indentured servants to their husbands is hateful.
80,"Depends what you mean by that. Are trans ppl valid? Yes since men and women are sociological terms, not biological ones (that would be males and females"
81,"That's a good point, I'm wrong. However I do stand by the fact that in this specific instance, she wasn't harassing anybody. She's still shitty, but I don't see who she's harassing."
82,"I’m sure some of the more uptight men wouldn’t allow their women to read out of fear of them getting smarter than the man

For these religions that’s like half the reason behind any man written rule lol"
83,"No, just that she should shut the fuck up about it afterwards."
84,"I just tried to read that, but the “saturated in Jesus” comment made me throw up in my mouth a little."
85,Earth should ban her permanently
86,"I support cruel and unusual punishment for child beaters like her. As well as the death penalty. I don't care how it sounds, there are certain crimes that cannot be excused."
87,"As if beating and starving her children wasn’t bad enough (seriously, why isn’t she in jail?) the part about her saying other Christian bloggers who died young were burning in hell is absolutely hideous. The poor woman who died a suicide wasn’t “listening to the voice of Satan,” she lost a battle with depression! But then, Lori wouldn’t know about compassion, since she has none."
88,"He knows that, he's just trying to be edgy."
89,I don't wish harm on anyone. But I'm a fan of her brain tumor.
90,Like I said: I don't wish harm on anyone. I'm just saying her brain tumor is more likable than she is.
91,She's vile. She has said it's a mistake to elevate the words of GOD above the words of Paul. And she claims that she's not preaching - she's just instructing other women. Twitter needs to shut her down.
92,"It's not edgy to value free speech, even if I don't value the other person's opinion.   
Society used to be ruled by people who were like-minded to that person, and thankfully free speech enabled us to progress.   
Now I entirely doubt society would or could (at least easily) go back to that, and free speech has historically led society forward more.   
Restricting things based on what can be perceived as hatred is a form of censorship that removes discussions that need to be reminded to society sometimes for the value of the discussion being had. 

  
Does the woman in the post possibly hate other modern women? Maybe.  
Is the baseline for what she's saying essentially misogynistic? Yes.   
But is the post in and of itself promoting hate? That gets subjective, and that's where the open discussion rather than a flat-out rejection of a topic should be embraced by society.   
It's embracing the discussions of negative topics that have always mobilized society forward. 

Also, isn't ""edgy"" being trendy?   
The trend certainly (at least not anywhere I've seen) isn't advocating for uncensored speech on everything, even topics I don't agree with.   
The current trend is the censorship of topics that some populations disagree with."
93,"god be like

""shut up women aren't supposed to talk, they're supposed to cook and clean, how do you have time to twitter, here imma delete a chunk of your brain"""
94,And that's the VERY LEAST she should get.
