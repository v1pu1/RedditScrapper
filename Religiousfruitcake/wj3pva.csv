1,Wouldn’t this just violate the Equal Protection clause in the 14th amendment though?
2,"If Jesus was a state AG, what would he do? This is the type of questioning long since forgotten I am afraid."
3,Well I guess it's time for the Rapture. These fruitcakes need to go.
4,"Please sir can you spare a lunch for a starving child?

Sorry kid you shouldn’t have been a homosexual."
5,Article: https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/republican-attorneys-general-sue-federal-government-lgbtq-school-meal-rcna40250
6,"They were not given food because they were humans , they were not given food because they all violated Jesus rules. How immoral can a person be. Imagine being hungry all day and someone asks you if you are atheist/gay/lgbtq member or other religion followers and are denied food just because you are one of the above. What the FUCK"
7,Cause this isn't an awful thing to do to children or teenagers right ? /S  Seriously what the fuck some kids only real meals may come from school depending on their home situation. This isn't just wrong this is pure evil. Also how are they going to identify these students with unique markings like Hitler did during the Holocaust. Oh Johnny yea he's a fine nice Christian boy. Beth on the other hand she's got that marking that means she's not allowed lunch like all the good Christian folk cause she's not like Johnny.
8,"# prolife! Save the babies /s

Fucking assholes"
9,"Yeesh. Not a good move at all. I mean, denying kids lunch based on their sexuality? What would their supposed messiah say? That sounds rather controlling to me.

I’d tell those guys to be careful. Lest they want to cause Christianity to further decline."
10,"Republicans telling us the cruelty is the point without saying ""the cruelty is the point."""
11,Why in the fuck would we give free lunches to somebody because who they fuck?
12,"America lands of the not so free after all, thank Chtulhu I live in a free country but since Europe got its mouth firmly stapled to America's asshole we'll start this trend here eventually :("
13,"They are doing what their voter base wants. Their voter base would most likely want free lunches abolished because ""socialism"" or whatever."
14,Bigotry at its finest! Fuck!
15,These people are truly evil.
16,"If Jesus was to rise and tell them to be kind to LGBTQIA people, they would keep being bigot assholes. It's not about religion anymore, they just like to hate just for the sake of hating"
17,"Ahh yes.  I love the story of the loaves and fishes, where Jesus magically fed the huge crowd who had come to listen to him teach, but made sure that his disciples only fed people who were cisgendered and heterosexual.  

I also love in Matthew 25 where Christ said, 

""For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, but obviously if I was a trans kid it would have been totally appropriate for you to let me stay hungry."""
18,I wonder if they know how much hatred their “Christianity” inspires in the hearts of others - like mine.
19,"i need more of an explanation on this, are other kids already getting free lunches and this proposal would exempt LGBT kids from that? doesnt everyone have to pay for their lunch and this just states that lgbt kids should too, but that also makes zero sense to propose. isn’t the constitution (at least as of today’s interpretation) explicitly outlawing this making it stupid as fuck to attempt this ?? is it just being proposed as a means to get publicity/ ragebait?? am i having a stroke"
20,"""Abortion is murder! All life of precious! THINK OF THE CHILDREN! Oh, except the those, ew."""
21,Fuck christians. Fuck religion in general. It's a scourge upon humanity and must be eradicated.
22,"""This is American Christianity"" 

No it's just Christianity"
23,"""Christians"""
24,This is Christianity. They used to burn people alive. Lets stop pretending they were ever good.
25,"This kind of shit makes me wonder, do these people think that Jesus was a bigoted asshole who hated everyone that was different from him? Although plenty of people think that he was white even though he was born in the middle east 2000 years ago, so not the brightest group either way"
26,I don't care if that kid is scientifically proven to be the antichrist. No child deserves to starve
27,"Remember when Jesus fed the 5000 by multiplying the fish and bread but first he was like “Hold up, this is only for the straight Jews”?"
28,"A friend of mine had a brother who was a hardcore Republican pastor. He made the argument many times that the government has zero obligation to feed the poor. You’re supposed to do it yourself if you’re a Christian (which he doesn’t anyway), but not with tax money so apparently Jesus is a libertarian."
29,Christians ☕
30,On the bright side if Christianity is real they are def not going to heaven. For it would be easier for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
31,Jesus would be proud! /s
32,Weird how much disdain they have for fellow God-creations. Seems like they skipped all of the Jesus chapters.
33,It is they who are themselves the foot soldiers of the anti-Christ. Ironic.
34,"You know, I can't do anything about them having a shitty opinion. But the moment they even attempt to codify that inhumane garbage opinion into law, they need to be thrown in jail"
35,“american christianity” just know that’s republicans. not christians. this is a huge problem every christian in this country has. people think republicans represent Jesus and it sucks
36,"We can start saying that the A in LGBTQIA+ stands for atheist, and then sue for religious discrimination."
37,Source please.
38,"The post is completely wrong. It is the USDA that is trying to cut funding for school lunches for schools that they deem to be discriminatory toward LGBT.

The republican AGs are saying that the USDA does not have the authority to do that.

The AGs are in no way whatsoever proposing to deny school lunches to LGBTQIA students."
39,"Sorry folks but OPs post is misleading. These GOP AGs are not trying to deny LGBTQ+ kids school lunches. 

They are pushing back on the USDAs anti discrimination policy which basically says that if a school or district engages in discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, then the Federal funds used to support school lunch programs in that school, will be withheld. 

That’s a very different and much more sinister argument IMO. They are essentially saying that their state “reserves the right to discriminate”. 

Let that sink in for a moment. Knowing that the left has basically been asleep at the wheel for years, with regards to state and local elections, the right has been able to win at that level and gerrymander many states to within an inch of their lives. This ensures that they control the state. 

Now all they have to do is push AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE to the states for decisions and their bigoted and narrow minded views will win, every single time. 

It is is incredibly important (maybe now more than ever) that we all educate ourselves down to the sate and local levels and vote!"
40,No one is trying to deny school lunches to anyone. That's not what this was about.
41,"One thing wrong here. This isn't just ""American"" Christianity. It is just straight up Christianity. America is the place where they are closest to have control like a theocracy, so they can get away with a lot more. But this is just plain vanilla Christianity.

Edit: You all can deny it all you want. But take a good look at history. And tell me with a straight face that this exact same stuff wouldn't be happening in any other country if the Christian church were to get the same level of power there they have in America right now. You are lying to yourself if you can actually believe that shit. And denying objective reality, and history. And those who deny and refuse to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. There hasn't been a single example of the entire 2000 year history of Christianity where they got power, and didn't do this exact same stuff. Not one single instance. It is built in to the religion, and if they get power again, it will happen again. It just so happens that they got at least some of that needed power in America right now, but can you honestly say, if they had the same exact power in any other country, they wouldn't be doing the same? No, you can't."
42,"So, when will Christian Saudi Arabia drop? I'm excited to see the two talibans (white skinned and brown skinned) duke it out."
43,How f'in shameful is this...
44,Fuckin Christian fundies.
45,Citation needed
46,Source?
47,But I thought the internet people and the librarians were forcing them to be gay and trans?? Why are we punishing them?
48,"More religious ""love"" for ya."
49,Dang. Republican Jesus is something else.
50,"The second one?
I didn't think he'd ever get past the first one!"
51,Love your neighbor if they’re exactly like yourself
52,"What happened to ""Do unto others as you want to be done""?"
53,"Joseph: during famine feeds his brothers who sold him into the slave trade

Modern Christians: starve anyone who doesn't agree with us


The irony"
54,"This is gross, but it's also gross that school lunches aren't free by default."
55,"This tweet isn’t accurate at all, the author is confused about what’s going on. They don’t want to specifically take away lunch from LGBT+ students. The federal government says “if you discriminate against LGBT+ students, we will cut your funding.” These AGs are mad because they want to be allowed to discriminate against LGBT+ students and still get federal funding for free lunch."
56,Wait what? Was this recent? I've not heard anything about this
57,I know for a fact the Yeshua ben Yosef of Galilee would be disgusted and mortified that this is what his teachings came to.......And im not even Christian!!!!!
58,"National Christians: NatCs

Saw somebody else make this connection and can't help but share it.  It basically writes itself"
59,Ok I’m a leftie but this tweet is kinda bullshit and a dumb simplification. You could spin this the same way on Biden and say that he’s weaponing free lunches for kids to push his agenda (that being an update to the FDAs discrimination policy). Maybe it’s time to stop getting news from Twitter.
60,Oh they’ll feed you. If you agree to be their captive audience for an hour or so as they proselytize and accept a copy their flavor of the bible.
61,I'm Canadian and what's going on just south of the frontier scares me because it has a tendency to spill over on our side.
62,There is no hate like Christian love.
63,"Ah christians with the good ol'
God loves everyone!


 (((terms and conditions apply)))"
64,"Yes this is horrible.

On another note, im all for inclusivity but can we set a ""conventional limit"" to the number of letters used to refer to the lgbtqia+ community?"
65,That's very disingenuous. Nobody literally took lunches out of anybody's hand
66,[deleted]
67,"That’s not why they are suing. They are not attempting to starve those they don’t like. Imagine it this way. They are running a jail and their current laws allow them to put every prisoner in the same jail, from jaywalkers to murderers. Some are more at risk but they don’t care because it’s easier and cheaper to run. 

Then, the people who must - by law - provide money for inmate food say they must separate the nonviolent and violent prisoners or they will withhold the food money. 

They’re not trying to starve any specific prisoner because the result is, all of the prisoners would starve. They’re trying to not be forced to make the prison a safer environment ( which is in itself disgusting and shameful )

They suck but this is Fox News level of interpretation."
68,Why exactly should LGBT people be given free food and not others?
69,What the fuck no just because they're gay doesn't mean they deserve free food
70,They're not even pretending to not be monsters anymore
71,"All religion is trash but Christians are really taking the cake now. 

Braindeads."
72,Is this Forreal or did someone make this up as a liberal im questioning this.🧐
73,Yes but this way they could get that repealed or so they think/hope
74,"Yes, that's why they stacked the Supreme Court."
75,They want a supreme court fight
76,"There might be something covering this in their magical little book, maybe in Exodus 21, 21:8 or maybe 21:20 or 21:21

 /s"
77,constitution doesn't mean shit if you get five people on the court
78,"It could interfere with current interpretations of that amendment which include LGBT as a logical interpretation of ""sex"" as a protected class under the amendment, but the neither the supreme court nor congress can repeal a constitutional amendment."
79,"The first sentence of the 14th Amendment reads:

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.

In the minds of religious fruitcakes, LGBTQ+ aren't *people.*

That's what their argument boils down to."
80,"Yes, what they’re actually doing is suing because the USDA will deny free lunch funding to schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students.

They’re arguing that the USDA doesn’t have that authority.

Sure, their motives are morally reprehensible but this post is a leading misleading."
81,He'd eat a meal with those lgbt folks. No kidding he ate with the worst lot like zacheus as per their books
82,"Come on now, we all know that if the rapture was real these fuckers would definitely be left behind and probably blame everyone but themselves"
83,Weren't these the same people saying think of the children?
84,"The attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia are the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

22 states!  People in those states need to vote better. Especially ones who depend on tourism."
85,Thanks for posting the source.
86,"Ah yes, the tried and true GOP tactic of using states’ rights to justify bigotry."
87,He looks like a raisin that’s been left in the Sahara for a century
88,"> More than 20 Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit Tuesday against President Joe Biden’s administration over a Department of Agriculture school meal program that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

> ...

> The agency warned that states and schools that receive federal funds, which include the national school lunch program overseen by the USDA, have agreed to follow civil rights laws. Although the agency says it wants voluntary compliance, it also has promised to refer violations to the Department of Justice. It is not clear whether the federal government would hold back funding for school meal programs as part of its enforcement.

So the meme is fake news. The federal government is threatening to hold back school lunches from schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students. That's what the Republicans are against.

I dont support Republicans at all, but people need to be accurate when they criticize them."
89,"Even worse, the vast majority of those kids, while they may have already identified their sexual preference, are still virgins. The Bible forbids homosexual sex, it doesn't actually mention homosexual preferences or homosexual love. Just sex. So the majority of those kids aren't even doing anything the Bible prohibits."
90,And they wonder why the Christian population is shrinking.
91,No one’s actually trying to take away kids lunch’s this take is incredible misleading. This really about sports and bathrooms.
92,"Save the babies, but once they're born, you're on your own."
93,"And they try to threaten us with hell!

If their god existed, doing this in his name is going to get them special treatments down there"
94,Because fruitcakes are obsessed with knowing and controlling every aspect of your life.
95,I hope Europe sees the faults of America and learns. In Europe we have a legitimate left wing and people aren't evangelical.
96,They’d do worse than that. They’d call him fake news and then kill him again.
97,"22 Attorneys General are suing the federal government because school lunch funding is tied to non-discriminatory practices. They aren't petitioning to deny school lunches to LGBTQ+ students, they are suing for the right to discriminate against them in general without risking free lunches and other funding. It's similar to the tweet, but I don't think it's really the same at all. I don't know why the tweet would be distracting from a serious issue by stretching the truth (ok, lying) so much... that seems very counterproductive."
98,"I'm from Greece, one of the most Christian countries on earth. Nearly nobody here acts like this, even the most 'pious' people. It really is largely an American phenomenon."
99,"Erm feed the poor? Hello? Thats christianity,"
100,"""Scotsmen"""
