1,"News flash for the Christians, the Qur'an says it's true too. I guess that makes it true, by that logic!"
2,"Alright fine. The Bible is true.


God is pro abortion and making slaves out of non Israelites. Also the Bible doesn’t teach that Jesus is God.

Fine the Bible is true. 

Welcome to slavery Christians. No idea why you want this to be true"
3,"I am god. I say so. I dont care what you ""personally believe"", its true cause i say so.

Perfect logic."
4,"So ""YOU"" say."
5,"I just wrote a book that says 2 things

1: This book I wrote is true  
2: The Bible is not true

Now what?"
6,“When it comes to the cat in the hat…”
7,The people wrote the damn thing says so like laws and policy says so. It don't mean they is right but some guideline we forced to follow as a cult. The Bible can't even keep it rules straight as book to book changes what God what's.
8,"This person makes no sense. They are arguing nothing. The person obviously already believes its true and would just be debating actual meaning of a passage, so wtf is this person even arguing??"
9,So...about all that bacon I saw you buy yesterday...
10,"1 Timothy 2:11-14
Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor."

12,"Circular reasoning, nice."
13,"Ah so if I write a book with a bunch of shit in it then I write ""this is all true!"", will it make all true?"
14,This circle is circular because it's a circle
15,"2+2=5 

This post is true. 

Guys! I invented new math!"
16,"""And it means what I interpret from the text regardless of how the authors felt or believed."""
17,Cthulu is all because he tells me so
18,Okay soooo the tons of times the Bible literally contradicts itself over & over… who’s right what’s true ??
19,"I am god, boom i am the most powerful thing ever. Or do i need to write ot on a tree"
20,"What if the Bible said it wasn’t true, though?"
21,Well fuck my I'm convinced. I'm going to burn my Atheist Bible and go to church RIGHT NOW!
22,"If God is in every one of us, than by that logic I am God. By that same logic, I declare the Bible untrue if it were written not by me, but for me by a bunch old wandering desert dudes."
23,They had me in the first half...
24,I don’t care what you believe but believe me instead because I’m right
25,Just like the Koran and Torah and etc..all true. Right.
26,Betting she’s wearing mixed fibres in that pic?
27,"The bible is true 

Source: the bible 

This is like when PragerU sourced themselves when they said you should beat your kids"
28,Her circular reasoning is a impressive demonstration of the lack of logical facilities in her brain.
29,Gotta make sure I say my next book true in it. FYI it’s high fantasy. Like the Bible
30,This circular logic is making me dizzy.
31,Ah yes the bible claims itself to be true because the bible says so. What a compelling argument.  It has to get its credibility from somewhere. Oh wait it can't get it from anywhere else because no one can substantiate or confirm the events that  occur within it. That's why it's called faith it is belief without proof.
32,"Ok, if your bible says so, well my book here says that gender is a social construct. This study of evolution tells me we evolved from fish, then monkeys than neanderthals. It is simply true, the book says it is."
33,Now there's some critical thinking skills at work. Wonder how many PhDs that took to learn?
34,"Better have a war about the books then, right?"
35,"Because they haven't read it. Also murder in the name of god, and let's not even start on women's rights."
36,"*drops on knees and kisses feet*

*Gets smited for worshipping idols*"
37,It's not true until you tweet it
38,You and Kirk defeat the androids and beam back up to the Enterprise.
39,""". . .they say they sure know alot about all that, I totally trust their judgement!"""
40,One fish two fish red fish blue fish?
41,">and Adam was not deceived

OH GOOD, SO HE GOT US KICKED OUT OF EDEN ON PURPOSE THEN! How do people tolerate so much obvious bad faith haha. Most of the Bible contributors were evidently terrible people in their own historical context!"
42,"Just look at how circle-like the circle is, that's how you know. Praise be to the circle's glory."
43,"It’s the only way to figure it out, obviously."
44,"So, I mean are they sex androids? Asking for Kirk"
45,"One fish, two fish, five thousand fish, and of course Jesus really did it - otherwise they wouldn't have put it in the Bible!"
46,"The Book of Mormon would like a word, probably about being with your family forever."
