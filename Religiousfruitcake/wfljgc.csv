1,“I’d be helpless if my wife didn’t feed me and handle all my domestic tasks for me.”
2,Religion + incel? Relincel?
3,According to The New Testament Christian’s aren’t supposed to get married. According to Paul’s letters and Jesus’ response to the rabbis about marriage(I believe it’s in Mark)
4,People with small minds like Doug will never understand that not everyone needs to live according to the christian life script.
5,Being single is an important experience to have in life. I know christians think you should marry immediately out of high school but you shouldn't.
6,Something something women need a master something
7,"It was a recommendation based in Paul’s desire for ministry, and not a command. Right after in the same letter he instructs those without the gift of celibacy to marry rather than “burn with passion”. Christian theology has a bit of nuance on the subject as can be seen in the more ancient Christian traditions. Not sure where you’re getting Jesus telling people not to marry though. Forbidding marriage was warned against in Timothy 4:3. Marriage is a qualification to become a church elder in Timothy 3:2."
