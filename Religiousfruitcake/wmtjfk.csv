5,">never disrespect any religion

Funny how they try to advocate for this when they actively do this everyday, not to mention even their own teachings tell them to do that."
6,"Was this from one of Reddit's ""anarchist"" subs?

7,"It’s interesting to see how us and UN remain silent and promote Islamophobia while few to none Muslims don’t condemn this act. This kind of shit is currently happening in India where Nupur sharma who apologized for a unfortunate blasphemy is still being hunted by extremists and killed 5 people for supporting her. Had it been by Hindus, the world would have teared us down saying intolerant. Hope you know that a movie is made insulting our gods we either demanded to bring it down or minded our business and didn’t not hunt down actors and writers."
