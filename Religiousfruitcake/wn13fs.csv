1,Weather isn’t evidence of shit but that weather exists. I cannot get over how low iq these people are.
2,"That's a really good one. The mix of condescension and complete idiocy is perfect.

Yeah, you heathens, my fantasy math proves that you live on the same planet as others, therefore... JEEBUS!

Understand now, stoopid?

lol."
3,Weather being the same for all humans is somehow statistically improbable? Please elaborate…
4,So god does absolutely nothing to improve my life over none believer.  proof???
5,"Allow me to translate.

Matthew 5:45: God ain't doin' shit."
6,"6 years ago, I would have said this has to be satire. That there is no possible way anyone could come up with something like this, and honestly think it was right, or made any sense at all. But now? People no longer feel the need to hide or be ashamed of their stupidity, and wear it like a badge of honor. And even if this was originally said as satire, just to make fun of them, it is 100% certain that many actual religious people have read it, and thought ""Oh wow, I never thought of that, that's great!!!"" And now use it. These morons don't think. They wouldn't care to question what would make this ""statistically improbable"" just the fact someone told them it is, is more then enough for them to never again be able to be convinced otherwise."
7,Rain also falls in the MCU so.........
8,The last sentence almost makes me think this is satire.
9,This is outrageously dumb. Everyone knows Pokémon make the weather with their moves
10,"If you want to be literal.

The sun doesn’t rise.

Check mate Christians"
11,"Actually that sounds like the default. If the sun shown on believers of one religion and on no one else THAT would be proof.

As it is now isn't statistically improbable at all. And also statistically improbable things don't prove a god or anything magic.

There are quadrillions of extremely unlikely things that could happen. So odds that some of them will are actually very high."
12,"Fascinating! Bible writers were aware of something everyone with eyes can observe. Must be divine revelation lmao

I think this is to be taken in a bit mors methaporic sense, but guess it went over his head over his amazement of this insane revelation"
13,my husband wants to play poker with this genius
14,It's statistically improbable that weather wouldn't vary to a person you're standing next to? This dude is some master statistician.
15,"In the words of my friend, a pastor...""Spurious correlation""!"
16,"A sentence from a book is evidence of the existence of ""god""?

So, does this mean the Bram Stokers Dracula is evidence that vampires exist?"
17,"Silly censored username! Yahweh doesn’t make make weather, because he isn’t real! Rainbow Dash does!"
18,Im stunned
19,This seems like satire…?
20,"He said ""let there be light.""  I got a light.  Proof, right?"
21,"Welp, I guess this disproves God, then: https://twitter.com/HumansAreMetaI/status/1555869103994605568

(That car knows what it did.)"
22,So many levels of backward here. If the weather wasn't the same then they'd have some solid evidence of something.
23,"""It is by his design that both the wise and the fool will loose grip of their personables, that even the holy and the evil will slip on a banana peel all as one"" Matthew 89:58

So just remember atheists if your world and my world are behaving the exact same way for no reason there is reason and it's GOD1!"
24,"Bullshitticus fuck:you also says. Because God is such a sound dude, he let's everyone, Athiest or Bible thumper breathe the O2 in the air indiscriminately!

Aha!!!! See!!! GoD iS rEaL"
25,???? What????
26,Trying to use a Bible verse as proof again. They never learn.
27,"something something something dark side

something something something complete"
28,Coz it’s raining that means god is real
29,Oh. OK.
30,This is satire.
31,The statistically improbable fact of having the same wether when you're in the same place at the same time. Mind blown.
32,"If anything, this is the proof of random nature of universe"
33,If I’m around another decent human being they’re more than likely *not* a Christian.
34,"We atheists don't need threat of eternal damnation to be decent human beings, unlike religionists.  That makes us *more* decent than them."
35,"Ah yes, the “But..  Look at the trees!” argument for the existence of God."
36,Fuck this Christian fundie
37,There’s no saving someone like this. But then also imagine how annoying she would be if she did become atheist.
38,"...statistically improbable event.  Of two people in the same place at the same time experiencing identical conditions.  Yeah, that definitely hasn't happened 100% of the time."
39,LMAOOOO
40,"""Moral People""...

I wonder who this person is referencing? 🤔 

Because obviously if you don't have God in your life, you have no morality... right? That's the flawless logic here?

It amazes me these people own things and live moderately successful lives..."
41,"Damn, it's so cute seeing them try to fire their brains up like this after years of atrophy.  

Keep going Tiger! You're doing great!"
42,This has to be Satire.
43,"Yeah, I've been in really nice weather, and surrounded by assholes"
44,"That, and using the claim as proof for the claim is about the saddest circular reasoning possible."
45,"> The mix of condensation and complete idiocy

^FTFY *winks"
46,"Right? And as you sit there, dumbfounded, they will declare themselves correct and saunter away."
47,"Exactly! Everyone gets the same weather, no one has to go to church!"
48,"If he loved you, why you're a non-believer right now makes no sense. Or, in being such, considering how threatening you are to the world now as you can deconvert at anytime, you should be hellbound or should have been the moment you gave God the permanent middle finger."
49,yea they are terrible and at the very least should have to give up 30% of their land and property to back taxes but at least the catholics feel some shame.
50,Little too clever a shot for a believer?
51,I had clicked out and had to come back and upvote rainbow dash.
52,"Fuck you, but r/Angryupvote"
53,"The catholics only seem to feel any shame because they fell the farthest and hardest out of the Christian sects. They had complete control of europe for a very long time, and could do anythign they want. And now, to not lose people, they pretend they are sorry, and that they are different. But the reality is, that if they were giving back that same control, they'd go straight back to being exactly the same and just as bad as before, with no dely."
