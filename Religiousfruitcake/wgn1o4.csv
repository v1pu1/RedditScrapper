1,People think schools are banning Christianity but itâ€™s really that schools are banning enforced Christianity
2,The kids will love listening to Jesus reminisce in ancient Aramaic.
3,"If Jesus of Nazareth spoke in public schools today with his message of turn the other check and sell all your worldly possessions and give the money to the poor, the Republicans would be screaming ""arrest the Socialist."""
4,Love how they still think Jesus was white.
5,"Hang on, Jesus is not banned from schools, I'm sure he'd be welcome if he showed up!"
6,"Yeah, but that first guy isn't *actually* Jesus, so I don't know what their point is."
7,"You know know what, let's try this. You show me one way you follow what Jesus taught you to do (and you get a point), and I'll show you where either Jesus never said that, or how your failing Jesus (and you lose a point). If you have more than 1 point at the end, you win and Jesus can be taught in a classroom about religions. If you have 1 point or less,  you shut up and actually read the damn Bible you claim to love so much."
8,You can pray in schools the school just can't force you to pray or push religion on you without your consent. Why is this so hard for them to get?
9,"Well, no one in drag ever caused half as much cruelty and damage as religion."
10,Wow thatâ€™s a very white Jesus
11,"These ""Christians"" aren't just homophobic.  They are self deluding assholes, who lie about their imagined persecution.  Jesus is not at all banned in schools.  A child can bring their Bible.  They can pray openly in their free time.  They can even promote their faith to others, and are only discouragedif it is unwelcome.  I am a teacher and I've seen this many times.  If someone makes fun of them, we discourage hateful or bullying behavior.  Children expressing their views, whether on religion, the environment, politics, or whatever is not just allowed, but encouraged by teachers and the administration.  What these ""Christians"" want, and what teachers are generally against, is forced prayer or other forms of systematic indoctrination in our schools."
12,"Am I wrong, or is Jesus always wearing a dress, has long hair, and promotes an alternate lifestyle?"
13,"I had no idea that Jesus was alive, and trying to get into our school buildings."
14,"One is a convicted criminal.

There other isnâ€™t"
15,"Hey man, I'd welcome both LGBT folks *and* Obi-Wan Kenobi into schools."
16,"""Drag is bad because I think they're ugly ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡""

-what i think these people think"
17,So just going to say I really don't think schools really are doing this behind parents' backs. I do think it's parents bringing their kids to this.
18,The difference is oneâ€™s secular and the other is religious. Separation of church and state. Perhaps youâ€™ve heard about it.
19,"I'm confused. Here in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, drag readings are done in public libraries, not in school (unless someone changed things recently). Is it done in school in the United States?"
20,"I need a remake of this graphic but Jesus with image of that fucked up Jesus reconstruction painting, and drag queen as photo from professional photoshot of idk maybe aquaria"
21,both of them are welcomed..
22,A queer queen that teaches equality is better than a product of an eternal ghost having sex with a human female that teaches why the above is good
23,I doubt if they let a Middle-Eastern man called Yeshua near the kids to begin with.
24,"in my country religion is part of the school orgran once a week

om telling you, nobody gave a shit and eevryone was playing clash royale or whatever during those classes because they were boring as fuck"
25,"I like to think he already returned, but was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and is now being held at gitmo as an enemy combatant getting waterboarded every day."
26,He has terrible attendance.
27,Itâ€™s Kenny Loggins. Theyâ€™re banning Kenny Loggins from our schools. Singing the Top Gun theme will get you detention.
28,I want this to be a game show. A dark aggressive game show.
29,"Because unless everyone else I being forced to act and think the way they do, they're being oppressed."
30, HA!
31,Heâ€™s been trying to get in through the vents recently
32,HE HE HE HA !
33,May I please steal this idea for a conspiracy novel?
34,Not K-Log! Now we've truly entered the *DANGER ZONE*!
35,May I please have the link to pre-order my copy?
