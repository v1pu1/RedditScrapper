1,Is it peer reviewed?
2,Do they forget that the biblical Old Testament is basically the torah?  That Adam and Eve are revered in the Quran?  Or do they ignore that religious texts existed before the Bible?
3,*The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy* has entered the chat.
4,"Sounds like a very bad history book. I mean, it can’t even agree on the details of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ."
5,If you do this (put more than half the words in your paragraph in parenthesis) it looks bad (because it seems like you don't know how to properly structure a paragraph (so that it introduces subjects and then provides information on them))
6,"I would love to see Muhammed, Vishnu, Satan, Zeus, Yahweh and Asherah, etc gathering together to discuss the validity of the Bible."
7,"The Old Testament IS the Torah. It was also written with no vowels or punctuation. 

Also, fun fact, there was no male pronouns used to refer to Adam until the creation of Eve. The language it was then first translated to didn't have the term for single, genderless, human pronoun, so they just used ""he"" and ""him."" But Adam was not a man or male in the beginning of the Bible. 

The Quran shares MANY Biblical stories, Abraham going up the mountain to sacrifice his son, Adam and Eve, Noah, Jesus, etc. I feel like people shouldn't be able to whine about various religious texts, without ever having read them. I also find that most people who claim to be Christian and hate the Quran, have never read it, or even seen one before."
8,"This is from a Christian ""science"" book about dinosaurs."
9,"I agree. I have read all 3 for comparing and contrasting. I found a few minimal differences between the Torah and Old Testament. But these are expected as different translations over thousands of years. The story of Abraham in the Quran has Abraham sacrificing a different son. His firstborn, whose mother was the slave, not Sarah’s son. I even tried to read the Book of Mormon."
10,Ah. Gotcha.
