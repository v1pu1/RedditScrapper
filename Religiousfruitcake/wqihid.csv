1,"To summerize.

To summarize much had a purpose in life and that purpose was worshipping Allah so never said this.

Buddha actually said ""Do not seek the truth"" and what he meant was not fighting over right and wrong and not fighting over whether there is a God or not.

Confucius, I can't find anything suggesting he ever said anything close to that.

This post honestly is trying to make Christianity look superior without actually fact checking if any of these other characters actually said this."
2,"As someone living in a country that is very Confucianism-dominated, it’s not a religion, and Confucius isn’t “venerated” as a holy figure at all. Yes his teachings are considered important but it’s not like anybody gives a fuck whether or not he rose from the grave. And speaking for Buddha, I’m pretty sure there is not a single Buddha nor is he supposed to be considered a god."
3,"Ah, the definition of Modesty and Humility ❤️"
4,"Also, Jesus never said that. Ever. Only in John does Jesus talk about himself this way. And we know John was fabricated by some Greek guys who didn't know Jesus personally."
5,"HOW DARE YOU DRAW OUR BELOVED PÉDÖ RÃPÎST?????

/s Obviously"
6,"But the Budha achieved enlightenment, I’d rather die knowing the secrets of the universe than spend the rest of eternity as skydaddy’s pet"
7,"Muhammad said our purpose in life is to worship Allah until we die. (wow what a good purpose /s) 

I don't know much about other religions but I'm sure Buddha wasn't considered a god or a prophet."
8,"Muhammad, Buddha, and Confucius all had reliable accounts of their existence."
9,Jesus is probably the only one of these 4 that didn’t actually exist too…so there’s that
10,"Nothing can keep a gay guy down.

I mean come on, he went out for a meal with 12 dudes, drank wine, ended up stuck on some bdsm cross and got repeatedly penetrated.

Vanished for a few days, then popped up good as new."
11,Apologetics be like
12,"Bitch, Jesus is dead too. (If he even existed… which is very unlikely.)"
13,The uncanny way Jesus and Trump jack themselves off is why idiots believing Trump is Jeebus
14,Jesus is a zombie? I wouldn't want even my loved ones to 'rise from death'.
15,"Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfill Scripture he said, “I am thirsty.” A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips. When Jesus had tasted it, he said, “It is finished!” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

John 19:28-30

So last words allegedly are ""it is finished"", I had to look up their mythical little book for this. They really don't read it but just hide behind it."
16,The cult of narcissism
17,"This is what I find strange, some of them try to insult Muslims by saying Muhammad isn't coming back to life but Jesus will, like dude that's exactly what Muslims believe too."
18,So jesus be a zombie? Ok.
19,Prove it
20,"All religions say that they have the ultimate truth, but none has.
It's funny to see how Christians says things about Mohammed he never said, and what is funnier that also Muslims say the same shit about things in Christianity that never happened.

So welcome to the club."
21,Despite thoss being fake quotes they make them sounds more humble than that boasting fuck Jesus.
22,"Yeah,  but Jesus died AGAIN, and this time he is taking his sweet sweet time aint he?"
23,"So Jesus had a massive messiah complex.

It never ceases to amaze how xtians take whatever is written in that mish-mash compilation of mystic poetry as literal truth. And the exceptionalism whereby their self-proclaimed messiah is valid whereas the other 100+ before and since are false."
24,And Gandalf said “For even the very wise cannot see all ends.”.... because he is also a character in a book.
25,JC comes across as a little bit pushy and kind of a pain in the ass.
26,"So if I say I am the way and have perfect knowledge, the best path to truth, and it all says the bible is nonsense, and science is the way I’m more likely to be correct just because I bragged about myself?"
27,"pretty sure his last words were something like ""quit fucking stabbing me with the damn spear"""
28,at least the first three are honest about it.
29,"The Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny and Santa all ""rise from the dead"" seasonally. 
Your point?"
30,"Before I die, I am going to say ""Jesus is a f**$ing tw@t and a liar"" and then I am going to shoot myself into space and return to the heavens. We'll see what they have to say after that!"
31,Jesus actually said Father Father why have you forsaken me. You think he would know this answer.
32,I trust someone who can admit they don't know something more than I trust someone who claims to be the only one to have all the answers
33,"Damn Jesus, gatekeeping heaven much?"
34,Bro my sister also rose frome the dead she was legally dead for like 3 minutes
35,He also said if your right causes you to list after a woman that you should rip it out it’s socket and basically hurl it into an open field. Forgive me if I don’t take him seriously.
36,"Buddha is the other name of sidharth gautam, he didn't die.... He took a samadhi"
37,Jesus also said “The gays are alright by me” after being asked about hanging out with dudes all the time. Source: https://ithappenedbecausemybooksaidso.com
38,"I love how everyone else gets a photo from at least the head up (even if some of them really shouldn't tbh, I don't know jack-squat about Islam or Mohammad but I'm pretty sure putting a picture next to a quote of his is pretty not cash money to say the least) but all good ol' JC gets is just the legs.

I guess Jesus never skipped leg day."
39,"The only time you see the words ""Christianity"" and ""fact checks"" next to each other is if the word ""never"" is in between them."
40,this honestly sounds like theyre mocking christinanity until the last line
41,"They don't care.  

Religion isn't about facts.  It's about fiction, and the idiot that can scream the loudest is often the winner, whether or not they're right or wrong.  

This is idiot christians screaming fictionally.  All other religions do the exact same thing.

This worked because it got your attention and you reposted it.  You did exactly what they wanted you to.  Because of your actions, you allowed religious people to scream a little louder and reach a few more people."
42,"
>Buddha actually said ""Do not seek the truth"" and what he meant was not fighting over right and wrong and not fighting over whether there is a God or not.

And Pete said ""Do not seek the treasure."" Pete was right, and also he was not a toad."
43,They never fact check. That's why they're christians.
44,"As someone also from a Confucian-inlined culture, I concur. 孔子 teachings are very much treated like that of a preferred foundation for social structure, not holy teaching. Even his opposite, 老子 teachings, which are somewhat more transcendental, metaphysical and existential are also not seen as holy teaching."
45,"Buddha was a real guy but he wasnt a god, and didnt tell people that he was a god either

There were some buddhist monks who reached similar levels of recognition as he did"
46,"Just like Christian love, it isn't what you'd first expect from it giving what they call it."
47,"Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, the Gospels are fictions based on Paul's letters and the LXX.

Kurt Noll says *""Early post-Pauline writings transmit favourite Pauline doctrines (such as a declaration that kashrut need not be observed; Mk 7:19b), but shifted these declarations to a new authority figure, Jesus himself.""*

The Gospels were intended as ""cleverly devised myths"" (2 Peter 1:16, 2 Peter being a known forgery).

**The Donkey(s)** - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.

Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).

Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.

**The Sermon on the Mount** - Paul was the one who originally taught the concept of loving your neighbor etc. in Rom. 12.14-21; Gal. 5.14-15; 1 Thess. 5.15; and Rom. 13.9-10. Paul quotes various passages in the LXX as support.

The Sermon of the Mount in the Gospels relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.

**The clearing of the temple** - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from a targum of Zech. 14.21 which says:  ""in that day there shall never again be traders in the house of Jehovah of hosts.""

When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).

**The Crucifixion** - The whole concept of a crucifixion of God’s chosen one arranged and witnessed by Jews comes from the Greek version of Psalm 22.16, where ‘the synagogue of the wicked has surrounded me and pierced my hands and feet’. The casting of lots is Psalm 22.18.  The people who blasphemed Jesus while shaking their heads is Psalm 22.7-8.  The line ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ is Psalm 22.1.

**The Resurrection** - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. 

**Barabbas** - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two ‘identical’ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the other’s blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means ‘Son of the Father’ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the ‘Son of the Father’ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israel—the one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name ‘Jesus Barabbas’. Thus we really had two men called ‘Jesus Son of the Father’.

**Judas Iscariot** - Judas is derived from a passage in Paul's letters. Paul said he received the Eucharist info directly from Jesus himself, which indicates a **dream.** 1 Cor. 11:23 says ""**For I received from the Lord** that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread."" Translations often use ""betrayed"", but in fact the word *paradidomi* means simply ‘hand over, deliver’. The notion derives from Isaiah 53.12, which in the Septuagint uses exactly the same word of the servant offered up to atone for everyone’s sins. Paul is adapting the Passover meal. Exodus 12.7-14 is much of the basis of Paul’s Eucharist account: the element of it all occurring ‘in the night’ (vv. 8, 12, using the same phrase in the Septuagint, en te nukti, that Paul employs), a ritual of ‘remembrance’ securing the performer’s salvation (vv. 13-14), the role of blood and flesh (including the staining of a cross with blood, an ancient door lintel forming a double cross), the breaking of bread, and the death of the firstborn—only Jesus reverses this last element: instead of the ritual saving its performers from the death of their firstborn, the death of God’s firstborn saves its performers from their own death. Jesus is thus imagined here as creating a new Passover ritual to replace the old one, which accomplishes for Christians what the Passover ritual accomplished for the Jews. There are connections with Psalm 119, where God’s ‘servant’ will remember God and his laws ‘in the night’ (119.49-56) as the wicked abuse him.  The Gospels take Paul's wording, insert disciples in it and turn it into the Last Supper.

**Virgin Mary** - The Virgin Mary was invented by G. Mark as an allegory for 1 Corinthians 10, verses 1-4.  Paul refers to a legend involving Moses' sister Miriam.  In Jewish legend ‘Miriam’s Well’ was the rock that gave birth to the flow of water after Moses struck it with his staff.  Paul equated Jesus with that rock (1 Cor. 10.1-4).  But when Jesus is equated with the water that flowed from it, the rock would then become his mother.  Thus ‘Mary’s well’ would have been Jesus’ mother in Paul’s conceptual scheme.  Philo of Alexandria equated that rock with the celestial being named Wisdom which was then considered the feminine dimension of God.

**Miracles** - The miracles in the Gospels are based on either Paul's letters, the LXX or a combination of both.

Here is just one example:

It happened after this . . . (Kings 17.17)

It happened afterwards . . . (Luke 7.11)

At the gate of Sarepta, Elijah meets a widow (Kings 17.10).

At the gate of Nain, Jesus meets a widow (Luke 7.11-12).

Another widow’s son was dead (Kings 17.17).

This widow’s son was dead (Luke 7.12).

That widow expresses a sense of her unworthiness on account of sin (Kings 17.18).

A centurion (whose ‘boy’ Jesus had just saved from death) had just expressed a sense of his unworthiness on account of sin (Luke 7.6).

Elijah compassionately bears her son up the stairs and asks ‘the Lord’ why he was allowed to die (Kings 17.13-14).

‘The Lord’ feels compassion for her and touches her son’s bier, and the bearers stand still (Luke 7.13-14).

Elijah prays to the Lord for the son’s return to life (Kings 17.21).

‘The Lord’ commands the boy to rise (Luke 7.14).

The boy comes to life and cries out (Kings 17.22).

‘And he who was dead sat up and began to speak’ (Luke 7.15).

‘And he gave him to his mother’, kai edōken auton tē mētri autou (Kings 17.23).

‘And he gave him to his mother’, kai edōken auton tē mētri autou (Luke 7.15).

The widow recognizes Elijah is a man of God and that ‘the word’ he speaks is the truth (Kings 17.24).

The people recognize Jesus as a great prophet of God and ‘the word’ of this truth spreads everywhere (Luke 7.16-17).

48,Does jesus ever write anything in the bible
49,"Oddly enough, some Hindus consider Buddha a God"
50,Thank you!
51,And Jesus got nailed to a tree for his bullshit.
52,"Pretty sure, depending on which version of the story you want to believe, Jesus died, got buried and then after a long weekend mostly dead, came back to life as a zombie 

Then carked it again.

So even Christians think Jesus as is dead as anybody else physical body wise. They just think he lives on in heaven. Which of course is completely evidence free"
53,A lich
54,Actually he didn't. Later members of his sect started believing he was God. Here's a PDF you might be interested in: https://ia800208.us.archive.org/25/items/HowJesusBecameGodTheExaltBartD/How_Jesus_Became_God_The_Exalt_-_Bart_D.pdf

57,"No, nothing he said was ever written down. Most of the apostles we're illiterate and simple. That's why Pauline Christianity took over hundreds of years later most of it contrary to Jesus teachings."
58,"That's quite surprising, I have never heard of that before.

Also, Happy Cake Day!"
59,"Welp, guess time to nail that piece of cheetos with a toupee to a tree"
60,"The whole Jesus story in general is completely evidence free. There is nothing to suggest he was real. And the story goes directly against what we know of how things were done at the time to boot. And you'd think the Roman's, as good as they were with records would have something, but nope. There isn't a single non biblical mention of Jesus anywhere, until you go out nearly 100 years after the events would have happened, and then they literally just reference the Bible for it. 

After the Roman's converted a scholar actually noticed this problem. And went back and forged a bunch of documents about Jesus. He didn't like there was no mention. And Christians even used these as evidence for a long time. It was all they have. But now there is nothing."
61,"it's been 4 days, get readin'"
62,Thank you! : D
