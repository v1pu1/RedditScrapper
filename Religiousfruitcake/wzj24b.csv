1,"WTF?!!?!
As a Christian I can say Churches are Public Property.
Especially if they have a PokeStop and gym"
2,Stopping Pokémon players from getting to the gym? What are these guys? Real life Team Rocket?
3,Religion is just a Karen factory
4, If you have to flash a gun at someone  just because they happen to  be walking within the vicinity of a church or anywhere public(regardless of it maybe being private land). You have a serious issue and are likely  a violence prone idiot.
5,"And this is completely legal. Those people haven't been locked up for threatening someone's life, they're allowed to freely carry deadly fucking weapons without having to demonstrate any legitimate reason whatsoever.  


I hate it here."
6,Racist churchgoers? I'm shocked!
7,The church sounds fishy probably up to no good. They probably don’t want something recorded and think they are being investigated.
8,If it’s private property then they should be taxed. Pretty simple.
9,About the only time a church actually served a purpose to me was during the years I played Pokemon Go.
10,My sisters church has untrained armed guards.  I refuse to go there with her.
11,"But hey, guns aren't the problem, right? People are! Even though this would never happen if guns weren't easy to come by, because none of those people would've gone to look up an illegal way to get a gun. And even by chance they did, the police would now go and arrest them for having said gun."
12,I'd go back to make sure the building wasn't flammable.  I'm sure they don't want some freak accident to burn the place down.
13,There’s no hate like Christian love!
14,"I'm surprised I don't see here what I often see about Islam :

> religion of peace"
15,"Sounds like a real Christian attitude.

Must've missed Jesus' sermon on the glock..."
16,Suprise!
17,Just another reason why I carry is because of people like them.
18,"Sometimes I'm glad I live in a liberal area because of shit like this. The churches here are considered gun free areas and the cops would actually investigate such a thing.

Cops have allowed homeless to sleep in the parking lots and steps of the churches around here, as long as they're not a threat to anyone or the property."
19,Who Would Jesus Blast?
20,"I'm an atheist that was raised to respect sacred ground, but threatening someone for just playing Pokemon Go and wandering into the wrong area is just nuts!"
21,"Prepare for trouble!
And make it double!
To protect the world from devastation!
To unite all peoples within our nation! 
To denounce the evils of truth and love!
To extend our reach to the stars above...

I had to lol"

23,"I don't know... I'm pretty sure brandishing or even flashing your weapon in a threatening manner, particularly as an aggressor, is still typically illegal. That's a completely different thing even than open carry. I guess it would depend on how fuzzy the line was, the fact that it would be a he said/they said sort and how closely involved with law enforcement the church is."
24,"I'm OP and I'm half Romani and half white, so basically white."
25,I mean most religious nuts I've run into would have at least tried to talk you up about God before pulling a gun so there must be something weird there
26,Is her church in a dangerous area or is the only danger a random mass shooter? Also shouldn't god be enough protection?
27,Gotta protect your church from those satanic atheists who might show up and... and... question us about some core tenants of our beliefs and force us to think critically!!!
28,"Playing devil's advocate, it could just as easily have been a knife, baseball bat, crowbar, broken bottle, or a firmly balled up fist. The gun wasn't the issue. The issue was the overly-aggressive ass-hat threatening someone for being in a church parking lot."
29,[deleted]
30,I mean that in its self is probably going against God via giving him a bad name and scaring off people from the church
31,"The fact that you referred to them as white, and said that they called you ""boy"", led me to suspect racism was likely the main issue."
32,"Yeah, but you're a *spicy* white, like an Italian or a Spaniard. Not good enough for them /s"
33,"No, it is in a town so small that if you sneeze while driving through you will miss it.  EVERYONE in town knows each other.  The kind of place you can take a midnight walk without pepper spray."
34,"All those are less likely to kill someone, less threathening and easier to avoid/run away from. Also, people like that don’t threathen others unless they have the clear upperhand. The gun is definitely the issue."
35,"Sorry, I beg to differ.

Was raised a catholic (without my consent).

Here's one sample amongst all the sites I found:

https://cct.biola.edu/religion-of-love/

(But I concur : there's no hate like Christian love...)"
36,"If I led a following, I'd want my people to WELCOME others. Like bro, why???"
37,I drew the same conclusions...
38,That’s what he wanted. OP is baiting. Just look at his history lol
39,Huh. Okay.
40,"Yeah, guys like that aren't running around getting into fistfights. They're turning every ""potential"" negative encounter into a possible gunfight."
41,Me too.
42,"???? I don’t see how he was race baiting in any way.. a boomer saying “boy” to a younger guy isn’t out of the norm, whether white or otherwise"
43,I agree with you. I’m saying that OP has a history of bait and trolling posts and so it’s not a stretch to assume he is here as well.
44,Ohhh okay I see sorry! I didn’t see any trolling stuff but I was just skimming and I’m pretty tired so I’ll take your word for it lol. Lots of those people on here
45,"I have no life and scrolled long enough. Claims of multiple different niche jobs, claims of being a man, claims of being a woman, claims of sleeping with underaged people on accident."
