1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Keep praying to your sky fairy you sick fuck.
2,"This is dangerous indoctrination (as you all well know).

Imagine a person earnestly thinking like that, getting just a tad unhinged..."
3,"That's any/everyone who think jesus will return in their lifetime.

â›ª: any second now...any second... ... ...any... second...

4,That sub ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®
5,Those people are all guaranteed narcissists. Like the Bible and Christianity has been around for thousands of years but youâ€™re so special that the rapture and all that dumb shit is going to happen in your lifetime? Why? Cause youâ€™re so goddamn important?
6,Death-cultist realizes they are in a death-cult.
7,"Boil it back far enough and what a lot of these folks want, really want, is vindication. Behind the endless chants of ""any day now, just you wait"" is the desire to be proven right so they can smugly say ""I told you so"" as they watch the people that disagreed with them suffer.

What a miserable way to live."
8,"Those people are on death drive, far beyond saving"
9,It's not even according to Christian/Catholic doctrine. New testament all but directly states that humans will have opportunity to sin without major God's intervention to give them a chance to earn their place in Heaven.
10,Maybe start with establishing the existence of gods before telling other people how to live their lives.
11,"""My church can't just murder whoever it wants to anymore. How can life be worth living for anyone?"""
12,Op your a sinner too good luck
13,Organized religion: the greatest con ever perpetrated on mankind!
14,Actually nothing to do with religion but simply considering all the horrible shit humans do I honestly kinda wouldn't care if some cosmic event destroyed the Earth. We are killing the Earth ourselves anyways.
15,That's r/noahgettheboat wrong sub op
16,"If you encounter one IRL, start running"
17,Upvote for appropriate use of endlessly looped gif.
18,"Try r/catholicmemes, it's worse!"
19,Rapture is not a Catholic doctrine. Your usual believer in Rapture would probably not make this kind of post.
20,Man the circle jerking there is insane
