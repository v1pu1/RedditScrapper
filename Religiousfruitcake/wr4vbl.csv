1,You can call me antitheist...im cool with that.
2,"So many muslims in the comments saying crap like: no religions should be insulted. We respect all religions

As an ex muslim I call BS on that. They insults all religions all the times. Infact forget about other religions. Sunni muslims and shia muslims have been shitting on each other and each other sect figures  for over a 1000 years."
3,Muslim insulting all ideologies except islam = fulfilling responsibilities as Muhammad (PBUH) intended
4,"Anti semitic is insulting Jews (free to insult the ideology of Judaism 

And people shout islamaphobia when anyone criticizes islam. Itâ€™s only wrong if you discriminate against Muslims, should be free to criticize the ideology"
5,What's the Muslim take in atheists?
6,"Islam has really gone out of its way to sell itself as kind, right? /s"
7,"Speaking the truth about islam will get you killed. You don't even have to insult it, doesn't matter how much it deserves to be insulted."
8,The survivors of Charlie Hebdo would like a word...
9,"Nobody has ever called me antisemitic because I pointed out falsehoods or crap verses in the Torah.

Maybe because I can stick to criticizing false claims and religious nonsense without blanket hating every jew on the planet and don't claim they burn forests down with space lasers."
10,It's baffling how someone this braindead even exists.
11,"This I believe was on this very sub earlier getting applauded.  
People are easily swayed."
12,Because the other three groups do go around stabbing people then cheering themselves on?
13,"""One of these is not like the other"""
14,I think you missed the point.
15,"It's so true, if a Swedish politician burns the Quran it's freedom of speech if he burns the pride flag he is a homophobe I don't want to be hateful by encouraging any of them but one is considered ""a piece of paper"" then the other is like that as well"
16,He's right. People who don't mind Islam being insulted yet get mad when anything else is insulted are such hypocrites.
17,There's nothing more Islamophobic than Islam.
18,![gif](giphy|KZMRyVjEtdv8AU6mIr|downsized)
19,What I learned from school is that anti-Semitism is hating on Jews for their race and anti-Judaism is hating on Jews for their religion
20,"""off with their heads""?"
21,It's a bad deal in any case
22,As long as you pretend the Quran has nothing to do with Islam.
23,What may be truth to some is falsehood to others.
24,He's not braindead. He is farming likes from muslim twitter and it worked.
25,"It wasn't a Swedish politician, it was a Danish-Swedish far-right activist and pretty much everyone called him out for being an ass.

Also, comparing Islam to LGBT is disingenuous. Voluntarily following Islam is following a religion of hate and oppression. Being LGBT is something you're born with, like green eyes or a dead twin."
26,Based Islam ðŸ˜¤ /s
27,Yep.
28,Guess I'm hateful and oppressive.
29,Don't be so dramatic. No Muslim cares about you.
