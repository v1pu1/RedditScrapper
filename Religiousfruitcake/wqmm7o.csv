1,"In a better position than you are. Wanna know why? Because I'm not a hypocrite.

I hear your god hates those people."
2,"So‚Ä¶wait. He stopped all the evil in the world already with the flood? Then why is there still evil?

Oh wait. He failed at that.

>‚ÄúAnd the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠8:21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV

Why yes. He does say that *after* he drowns almost everyone with a global flood."
3,Enjoying a world where 90%+ of all religious people suddenly disappeared.
4,God's definition of evil-doers seems like it might be different than mine
5,"Define ""evil."""
6,"Sex is the worst of the worst? Damn, guess I better go abort some babies instead or something."
7,"Suddenly living in a country willing to provide single payer healthcare, with plenty of housing for the homeless."
8,"Still doing what I‚Äôm doing because there is no god.

It‚Äôs wonderful not to live in fear of being destroyed for just trying to exist."
9,so what you're saying is god ain't done shit outside of some weird stories in a fucked up book?
10,"I would call someone that commits genocide as 'worst' and 'evil', but okay."
11,"Citing two genocidal events - one of which we KNOW FOR A FACT did not happen - as ""evidence"" for why your god isn't evil is ... an interesting choice."
12,I‚Äôd be in a way better spot than most christians.
13,"It depends, what timezone does the apocalypse work to?"
14,"Given what kind of things are considered sins, God should've destroyed self at least twice now."
15,"According to Islam I‚Äôd go to hell for watching the frozen movies lmfao, ‚Äúevildoers‚Äù is a reach"
16,"Probably masterbating, I don't have a lot going on."
17,"Asleep, like always."
18,"In hell, with you"
19,"So god tried and failed to get rid of evil twice, several thousand years ago, and then just... gave up?"
20,So your saying he failed twice look like the devil crossed up God in front of the baby Jesus his baby momma and Jesus step daddy Joseph
21,Noah's ark really pisses me off. Were the rules even communicated to people before God killed them all? Yeesh
22,"Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because they were shitty to their neighbors and travelers, right?  You know, the same shit Christians do nowadays."
23,12.01 your time or my time?
24,"The best response for someone posting this is to ask ""so does that mean Noah's flood was a true event that happened?"" 

There are so many issues with that story that it cannot be true and would totally back them into a corner they can't get out of."
25,Where would I be? Laughing  at all the empty restaurant booths on Sundays that were previously filled with douche bags in a cult.
26,"Noah's flood is the biggest evil. By ""getting rid of evil"" we don't mean ""kill everyone"" you genocidal piece of shit. If God is supposedly omnipotent, why can't he get rid of evil without causing harm?"
27,"Why doesn't he just start with bone cancer in children, fix that without saying ""God works in mysterious ways"" or ""God has called this child home"" bs.  Probably because he doesn't exist."
28,"Let's see... 12:01 is when Hulu puts up the programs I like without commercials.

So yeah, I'd be watching 'What We Do in the Shadows,' snacking on something tasty with a beer.

Actually, if there was a god and that god gave a damn, it would send something deadlier than COVID to weed out the stupid anti-vaxx idiots."
29,The same place I am when Santa Claus is going over his naughty list.
30,">‚ÄòWhere would you be?‚Äô

Sitting here laughing at the people who were panicking because they actually believe this shit."
31,#*I'd be* **Masturbating**
32,Probably hell. Because being wicked is fun and I‚Äôm not gullible enough to believe your bullshit
33,At yo mom‚Äôs house(i have been visiting every night for the past 173915 days)
34,That god seems to be very ineffective
35,But neither of those things happened üòÇüòÇ
36,"I'm pretty sure I would probably still be sitting on my couch, smiling about how the people that twisted their religion into hate were all gone."
37,"How many years does the bible cover? Because he didn't keep his nose out of shit back in the old days, these days you never hear so much as a squeak from the fucker"
38,Same place I was before. Balls deep in your dad
39,"These people actually think consensual, premarital sex is worse than Genocide, rape or even murder. I will never understand their religious priorities"
40,"Sounds like he did a shit job. Tried twice, failed both times. Really impressive God."
41,"Why is your God so shit at destroying evil, is what I wanna say"
42,"Ok so here‚Äôs what gets me about this.  Assuming you are a believer:  so God creates the world and then about 1600 years later it‚Äôs sooo terrible, he destroys it and starts over. And it‚Äôs only about seven chapters in BTW.  
Then about 300 years later, it‚Äôs so bad again, he destroys a city.  And we‚Äôre still in Genesis! 
Now here we are today, it‚Äôs how many years later (4500? Is that what they believe?) you‚Äôre telling me, shit gets destroyed twice in 2000 years, but it‚Äôs cool now?"
43,having a gay orgy with my friends in hell lmao
44,"Didn't he put up the rainbow after the flood to say ""shit guys, sorry about that. Promise, won't do it again""?

Still, the kind of God that gives cancer to kids is the sort that will quickly forget promises when they are no longer convenient. Or (and this is an outside guess), the whole religion thing is bollocks. Who really knows!?"
45,Probably sleeping like a baby as most of the theists vanish.
46,"Eating ass, probably."
47,Party! Woooooooooooo
48,"Enjoying a perfectly-chilled, dry martini with a Cuban robusto side car.

\#ProudToBeGuiltyRemnant"
49,Don‚Äôt tease me with a good time.
50,"I feel like there is a positive reading you could take of this. Something like ""don't wait around for God to fix the world, it didn't work out so well last time. Now it's up to us.""

Might be giving them way too much credit though."
51,"I wonder if the ""an"" is a typo or they think sodom an gomorrah is one place not two"
52,At home sleeping
53,"Probably lying in bed on my phone, unphased by this... threat? Idk what it's supposed to be aside from religious drivel."
54,"Man, God‚Äôs ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù haven‚Äôt worked at all, my goodness"
55,I'dbe the driver of the bus that's going straight to hell and I'd be dressed in a gasoline soaked banana hammock!
56,I'd be sleeping
57,Sitting aroubd Smoking Billies With Satan i guess
58,Should it not be 00:01?
59,I'd still be on Reddit scrolling through leprechaun porn. ü§∑üèΩ
60,Funny how evil was back in full force within a few years after those events.  Funny how a supposedly omniscient God couldn't predict that.
61,"Midnight in which time zone? I'm guessing it's a US one, probably EST, since we all know that God is American and favours that side of the country."
62,I will still be laughing
63,Asleep in bed!
64,"I wish the biblical God were real, because all the devout Christians who do horrible things in the name of Christianity would end up in hell."
65,"Why would he do such contradictary stuff if he's so perfect?

He has conflicting personalities. It's called the trinity"
66,"I've been working on a story with a couple of characters who are very diametrically opposed - a cop and a god. Cliched as fuck, I know, but hopefully not with the usual cliched ending.

Anyway, I've been working on these incredibly long - chapter length - explanations on how to explain that God can't do anything to fix things even though he's omnipotent, can't tell the future even though he's omniscient, and can't be everywhere at once even though he's omnipresent.

I expect to be crucified upon publication. :)"
67,"Circular arguments abound. What's your prooffor that event? The Bible,  and this one? the Bible,  and this? The Bible.... I don't think this group of people know what it takes to submit research. Believe me you are not doing research if this is your conclusion."
68,God has no imagination. The only way he can think to stop bad stuff is through murder.
69,"If God is good, why is there evil in the world in the first place?"
70,"Well now that I know it's tonight I can just get rid of all of my accumulated evil by confessing my son's, receiving absolution and having a chill evening, only to return to my wicked ways at 12:02, sharp."
71,I'd be laughing at yet another failed rapture prediction.
72,At lunch...
73,"Go ahead and smite me god, hell can't be much worse than this shitty existence."
74,"In bed, because I usually am asleep before midnight.  Some of us have to work tomorrow.  

We don't have legions of religious followers donating money to us to pay our way through life like a lot of religious leaders do."
75,Looking at ashes of megachurches
76,Jerkin off without my VPN!
77,"i would be in bed jerking off, duh."
78,Probably with all the rock stars. So not bad.
79,I only want to read the Bible to find out which version of the Matrix we're on.
80,In hell with all the fun people.
81,At 12:01 I‚Äôd still be asleep because God doesn‚Äôt exist
82,This shit hits like ‚Äúdeep thoughts with the deep‚Äù goddamn
83,"Last question, on my toilet shitting cuz burritos at my school be wild"
84,"If God is all-knowing, why didn't the flood or turning an entire city to salt work to eliminate evil as intended? If he is all-powerful, why resort to such violent methods? If he is all-good, why make us suffer so?"
85,Wait‚Ä¶ Which time zone are we talking about?
86,Kill people ‚â† stop evil. More like being evil.
87,Same Fuckn place I am now‚Ä¶work. Where my third shift peeps at?!?!
88,Trying to sleep in bed. It‚Äôll be difficult with all the scream of christonationalists
89,"I would still be here, laughing at this nonsense."
90,‚ÄúChristians are hypocrites!‚Äù proceeds to read laws from old testament
91,"Probably helping clean up all the ""Christian"" bodies."
92,"As goofy as this is, that last bit kinda goes hard"
93,Then I guess I'll pray to him once.
94,I guess I‚Äôd be dead because I definitely covet shit on the reg. I take solace knowing that every single religious fundamentalist would be dead too though.
95,In bed watching rifftrax after rubbing one out
96,"Bruh, this isn't the flex religious idiots think it is. Let's take a second and pretend they're right. So many non-religious people are so much better at the ""be good"" tenets of religion compared to the actual followers. Most of the religious would be fucked and most of the non-religious wouldn't."
97,In a world without religion.
98,So you‚Äôre saying god is good because he HAS the power to remove all evil... but chooses not to? Sounds pretty evil to me
99,"I'm going to be asleep in my bed, because 12:01 is past my bedtime"
100,Answer: on a highway to hell
