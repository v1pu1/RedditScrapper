1,"Why not all religions? You know, to let them make an educated decision"
2,"""alright kids, you know God killed half of the people on earth for no reason, and he sacrificed his own son for no reason"""
3,"Oh ill educate them alright, about the absolute horror they should stay far away from."
4,Top tier way to make another generation of atheists and agnostics.
5,Why on earth would we ever do that
6,"""Stay away from those creepy fuckers kids"""
7,Denny boy wants kids indoctrinated so they'll keep giving him money to lie to them.
8,"every parent has a duty to educate their children about any and all options so the child kan make an informed decision, unfortunately it doesnt happen nearly as often"
9,Atheist parents do. That education is why we raise atheist kids.
10,"Why do you agree with them?

Edit: I mean, if we don't talk about it, it might be over at some point."
11,"Stop at ""the God"".


My father is a defrocked catholic priest. When I came out of mandatory catholic teaching (more than 50 years ago, in French Canada), I was full of questions. 


My father took out an encyclopedia of religions and said ""plenty of gods in there. Take your pick.""

Made an agnostic out of me..."
12,"In my experience, atheists and agnostics usually know more about the God of the Bible than religious people who aren't theology scholars or something do."
13,"Uhm, yeah I mean children should absolutely have the right to be educated about religion. I'd tell them who believes what and why, but also what I think of theism. The rest they'll have to figure out for themselves."
14,Why that one specifically?
15,"I mean, I kind of agree, but specifically as a kind of anthropological and historical study, and to prepare them for the kinds of people they'll meet out in the world. Yes, there's some level of ""respect those who think differently from you"" in there, but I would moreso want to prepare them for the kinds of psychological batshittery and logical fallacies ans cognitive dissonance those folks use to justify their beliefs. The extremist ones, at the very least. How they use their religion to push a political agenda, etc.

One thing that really bothers me, having grown up in the Bible Belt of the US, is how liberals just really don't seem to get just how ubiquitous evangelical and related brands of Christianity are there, and how much it affects people's way of looking at the world and politics. It's not a moral debate, it's a whole different reality,  and not knowing how to interface with those kinds of people does any progressive no service."
16,"There are thousands of Gods and Godesses, literally thousands that span over different countries and different times.

We should educate our kids to show them that all are made up, none are real and all the crazys that believe in some imaginary being and allow that crazy belief to dictate how they live their short fragile life on a spinning rock in space should be avoided or treated with a disability.

If I have imaginary friends I'm considered crazy, but if it's a super powerful imaginary friend- that's religion."
17,"I'm happy to educate anyone's children about the Bible...provided I get to choose the parts that I'll educate them about. It's not like christians like anything about the Bible anyway except a general sense of liberal values=bad, conservative values=gud."
18,"PragerU is extremely stupid yet insanely successful

I live in a country that has nothing to do with American politics and have seen videos by them shared on WhatsApp"
19,We dont owe shit. And i did in fact tell my kid gods all of them arent real
20,Which god ? What bible? All of them? That’s gonna take some time.
21,I enjoy teaching kids. Makes them think logically & I advise them against blindly believing in something just bc someone tells them to
22,"My mom wanted me to learn more about religion, so she sent me to a church thing. I didn’t go back because they tried to teach us that if you don’t believe in Jesus, you’ll die and go to hell."
23,The Bible and education do not coexist.
24,"Well, being thoroughly educated in the christian god of the christian bible is how I became an atheist. So they have a point. Because as Andrew Seidel says ""The road to atheism is littered with bibles read from cover to cover""."
25,Same way we owe it to them to educate them about ra or Hercules or xenu. Humans ability to imagine has been corrupted by asshats that wanna say they are the only ones capable of knowledge.
26,"I think, when kids get old enough to think critically (around age 13), atheist and agnostic parents should make a family project of reading the Bible and discussing it. That should cement atheism for the children. 

I was raised Christian and have read the entire Bible, cover to cover, three times. Now I'm atheist. The best way in the universe to become an atheist is to actually *read* the Bible and *think* about what it says."
27,"I was talking to my then 10 year old son about the Bible. He looked at me and asked, Do people really believe that? I said yes and he just shook his head."
28,"Absolutely agree, the same way you educate them about people offering candy at shady vans"
29,"I teach my Children that there are many religions, it’s their choice to believe what they want but be wary of any religion claiming certainty of something no one can be certain of."
30,"Sure. When they get old enough, and have good critical thinking skills, then they can learn about the Bible. Until then, they don't need to. It's highly inappropriate for children to read a book filled with hatred, violence, rape, murder, genocide, discrimination, lies, inaccuracies, falsehoods, and evil deities."
31,What is PragerU??
32,Only to explain cultural idiocies and potential religious abuse.
33,"""educate them about the bible""

&#x200B;

correct me if im wrong but i suspect every person on this planet knows the bible exists! christians pls just stop"
34,"I’m a Deist and SO Atheist and we’ve decided to let our future kids decide what they believe in. They can be Muslim, Christian, Satanist, Buddhist  or whatever. Let them study and learn. We can respect their beliefs so long as they are not bringing harm to themselves or others"
35,Then Christian parents should teach their kids about witchcraft
36,Am I gonna force my kids to be atheists? No. Am i gonna force them to be religious? Also no.
37,"Honestly yes, if i'll ever have kid, i will read the bible to them and explain it. In italy they force you catechism through public school(thanks to some bald upside down man that ruled over italy something like 80 years ago), so before that happen i  will read the bible with them hoping that they won't fall into indoctrination made by the teacher"
38,"Yes, read the Bible to them, and let them understand how absolutely stupid and crazy it actually is"
39,"They didn't specify what kind of education it is, so technically they shouldn't have a problem with kids being told that god is a dick."
40,"I mean, RMPS was my favourite subject in high school and it was fascinating so I kind of agree 

Likewise I believe creationists should learn about evolution and arguments against religion"
41,"No, that is brainwashing and indoctrination. Now, if you want to teach the history of the religion, and how horrible it is, all the deaths it is directly responsible for, sure. But it should be illegal and considered child abuse to have them be part of any church, sunday schools, anything where they are being taught to be religious, it is child abuse. And it needs to be treated as such. Sadly we are a long ways off of being allowed to protect our children from this shit, but hopefuly one day we can get there. And all religious texts will be found where they belong. The fiction section."
42,"Lesson 1. Them people is crazy.

Seriously, if you want to make more atheists, do this. Teach them about people in the 21st century following a Bronze Age culture's 'wisdom.'

This type of thing is best left to the parents' decision, maybe they don't want their children indoctrinated in other people's superstitious delusions."
43,Well of course. They should know why they want to be an atheist.
44,"I went on a date once where the person was an atheist but insisted they'd teach their child about religion, just so they'd understand morality. I noped out of that one 😑"
45,Does he mean all the gods of the Bible?
46,Same way you teach them why they shouldn't touch a hot oven plate or eat spoiled food.
47,I read fairytales to my kids all the time.
48,"PragerU have an odd combo of religious posturing.   
Sometimes they really really realllly push it... Other times they have atheist people out just talking normal common sense.   
But I absolutely agree that knowledge of the history involving the Bible should be taught."
49,"This is the perfect introduction to god of the torah, bible and koran https://youtu.be/-suvkwNYSQo"
50,What happened to “let parents decide”? I think theism is silly and a waste of time. I’d rather they focus on math and science.
51,"I mean, yeah, but not for the reasons PragerU would prefer..."
52,"I teach my children about all man made tools, phisical or conceptual,

Their origins, uses and DANGERS."
53,I'll pass.
54,children cant make educated decisions so i make it for them /j
55,"Because religions are fairy tales so why would I present a bunch of made up crap to my kids? I'll raise them to be secular. If they eventually find a religion on their own that's up to them and I won't disown them or anything, but I'm not going to be actively teaching them about religion - at least not until they are old enough to think critically about it."
56,"\>religions

&#x200B;

\>educated decision

&#x200B;

pick one pls"
57,AND asked Abraham to kill his own...
58,There is no mention of dinosaurs in the bible why because God didn't turn up until people did
59,WAY more than half. All except like 12 people I think?
60,Half? The story said the flood killed everyone except Noah's family.
61,Let’s do it
62,I personally found it somewhat useful as there's alot of allusions to the Bible in literature. Plus its fun to watch Fruitcakes get pissy when you tell them Jesus was a radical socialist with sources to back it up.
63,"The best way to create more atheists is to get people to actually read the Bible. No way to be religious if you read *and* understand it. You realize how ridiculous it is and how, if true, the god of the Bible is actually a bad guy. 

Much better to educate your children than some weirdo showing up with the John 3:16 warm fuzzy parts and converting your kid into a dumbass."
64,"I talk to my kids about Christianity the same way I do about Greek, Norse, and Hindu belief systems. That is to say as impartially as I can. I think it's important to understand religion as the first attempts at science. Where do fire, rain, and earthquakes come from? There are also interesting themes that pop up like, ""don't worry about wealth and justice in this life, it will come after you die."""
65,"Alternatively, “stay away from those creepy kid fuckers”"
66,Stay away from radicals and people on the side of roads with signs.
67,I agree with this I believe options are good to provide.
68,if reading the bible doesn't do that to you it's already sus as hell.
69,"A large portion of the population is brainwashed into following a bronze-age death cult. You owe it to your children to educate them in how to navigate the dangers of the world, including the dangers of YHWH cultists."
70,I think he meant you should teach your kids about different religions
71,"I would be very happy if religion just died out and we'd only ever hear about it as a part of history, like we here about ancient Greek and Roman gods. But sadly, way too many people are brainwashed to the pint that it doesn't even occur to them that there's anything wrong with trying to indoctrinate other people's children.

As an example, when my husband's grandparents first met my son, they immediately pulled out a rosarie and explained to him that we're going to hang it up in his room to protect him from evil spirits. Obviously not going to happen, and luckily he's a baby who neither understood or remebers, but still, wtf?

Really the only way we can protect our children from religious indoctrination is if we explain religion to them and give them all the tools to think critically about the topic. And not just Christianity, of course, but all major religions."
72,"I agree with them

Christianity is unfortunately nowhere close to being over. We moved to a fairly large city and my kid still had kids talking about god/jesus in public kindergarten. 

We talk about bible stories the same way we talk about Greek, Aboriginal, Hindu, or Nordic mythology. By being familiar with the fables kids can start to reason why they're BS. Also can see they're no more believable than any other story, scarier, and less entertaining."
73,Why was he defrocked?
74,"Their videos are short, easy to comprehend, and sound correct until you start to break them down."
75,"I mean, as a book of what not to do I think it fits. Or this is what bad people think kinda thing."
76,Do you remember the moment where you realised you could question it all and start to think *what the actual fuck did my parents teach me*. Because I remember that well.
77,A video series on how to be an American religious conservative.
78,"Education's the devil
/S"
79,"Honestly, why not? As long as you aren't presenting them as truth or objective facts, I don't see the harm in educating kids about other belief systems. It can help children learn and practice understanding, empathy, and kindness towards others with different religious views. There are always going to be other people with different beliefs than your own and learning that from a young age makes for more open minded and accepting adults."
80,"Exactly. And if grandma happens to act like a religious fruitcake and your kid asks you, why, religion may come up sooner. But you don't decide anything for them. They can see it for themselves and decide for themselves."
81,"> Because religions are fairy tales

So?  People read actual fairy tales to kids!  That’s what fairy tales are for!

> so why would I present a bunch of made up crap to my kids?

How dare you compare religion to fiction!  Fiction is all made up crap and the majority of children’s stories are that.  Just because fiction isn’t true doesn’t mean kids shouldn’t read it!  I mean, a huge portion of books for children are fantasy books, like, are you really gonna pass up on *The Hobbit*?

Telling them made up stories is fine.

As for the Bible, yeah, that’s not appropriate for children, neither in terms of content nor writing quality."
82,AND asked people to chop off a part of their dicks
83,But the Bible does mention dinosaurs.  The one Noah sent out from the ark came back with an olive branch.
84,Or that he was actually a darker skinned individual of Middle Eastern descent.
85,"Since the sources are the bible itself... you shouldn't expect them to genuinely understand that.  
Religious people believe what they are told to believe and told how to think, and that's it.   
They aren't supposed to actually think for themselves.   
All Christian religions are cults."
86,Actually my parents raised me Christian and allowed me to see what other religions believe. That’s probably what helped me get into history as a hobby also. I had an open mind as a kid and they helped me keep it that way by letting me learn. That’s just my experience we all have different ones.
87,that reminds me of reverse exorcism. when the devil tells the priest to leave the childs body...
88,Religion will always exist even if we forget the current ones. We forget Jesus and some other guy named Gerard comes around and becomes the new messiah. Something about us humans just naturally brings religion.
89,"Defrocked himself...

Before the 60s in Québec, Canada, basically the only way to become a teacher was to be a priest. He wanted to teach, so the decision was obvious. 


Then the government nationalised education, telling the priests-teachers they would become civil servants, and asking ""civilians"" to enlist.


My father defrocked, had his education recognised and became a teacher, then met my mother...


When I was in high school in the 70s, a lot of priests were still teaching in public schools."
90,"My parents were educators, so we were raised to question everything, even though they wanted us to ""have faith in God"". I was 7 or 8 when I started reading the Bible the first time, and by the time I got to Genesis 2, I'd noticed a problem. I went to our preacher about it, telling him there was a contradiction I didn't understand. In Genesis 1, God created man *AND* woman from the dirt, but in Genesis 2, the woman had disappeared, and God made Eve out of Adam's rib. He told me that wasn't a contradiction, he told me I couldn't understand because I was ""a girl"". That pissed me off, and my dad, too! Daddy told him he should have explained it to me so that I *could* understand, but he never did. That was the beginning of the end for me, although I've spent the time since then (over 50 years) seeking evidence for their Jesus and God, and I've yet to find any. What many Christians use as evidence is the Bible, which is the claim. Also,  they'll say ""Just look around you!"" As if that's incontrovertible evidence for their God only, rather than every God men have created-- which is all of them. 

I'm open for evidence, but all I get is the same shit rehashed over and over and over."
91,‘Tis a front of diabolication! ^ ^ ’
92,"Because I believe it is presenting the child with a false equivalence that they are probably too young to guard themselves against. ""Look here son, you can believe in science or you can believe the world is 6,000 years old. All beliefs are valid so it's up to you!""

Obviously they are going to know what religions are and that there are many different belief systems out there. There's no hiding that and I wouldn't want to. But I was referring to the original subject of the post that suggested atheist parents educate their children about the ""god of the bible"", to which another commenter said we should educate them about all religions so they could ""choose."" Clearly these posts were meant to imply that we teach them about these gods/religions for the purpose of making them religious."
93,AND created people he fucking KNEW would sin.
94,"Nah, it’s just a really long book, and nobody wants to read something thousands of pages when it’s not exactly a page turner, so they just show up and listen to the man who says he read it give summaries and explanations of what it means.  Don’t blame them to be honest, it’s not something you’d want to read."
95,death cults no less.
96,"That's sadly true. And we can only hope the followers of Gerard will leave an option for those who do not wish to partake, though there are always the overzealous ones who don't evn see a difference between something being their beliefs and being an objective fact."
97,"As long as your religion has some niceties after you die, people will follow it. That's all any religion is: a security blanket to stave off the fear of death."
98,"That is valid as hell, thank you for your thoughtful response."
99,"Sorry for breaking the chain but I juss wanted to say this.

What I want to know tho. If theres a Gods plan, we were all meant to do what we do, meaning man made genocides were gods doing

If there isnt a Gods plan and we do have free will, that means he cannot protect anyone here, praying for help is useless and praising him for making hell holes on earth is not the best look either

If there is a Gods plan but we have a choice to not follow it...Let us know what it is then? Before we ""stray away"" from something we dont even know is there?

There has to be some sort of consistancy but in every one of em God is just making people suffer"
100,AND said to own slaves
