1,That's... racist?
2,"YES and no 

Usually Arabs aka Muslims don't want women to swim in the pool . So they have to separate between Muslims and foreigners"
3,"But you need to further seperate muslims into families because women are not allowed to show skin to non-mahram men whether they be muslim or not. So it is both divided muslim-nonmuslim and inside muslim part, different pool for each family?

So instead of seperating as muslim-nonmuslim wouldnt it be more suitable to seperate as men-women pools? Or public-family pools?"
