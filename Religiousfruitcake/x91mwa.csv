1,"I'm not going to buy it, but I'll pirate a PDF just to check how many non-christian and unconstitutional things these wannabe Talibangelists wish to enforce."
2,Fun fact: A theocracy doesn't work. Just look at the UK. Or France. History has shown theocracies don't work time and time again. So please. Don't repeat our past mistakes.
3,"Ugh. Christian Nationalism is NOT religious, nor moral. If you're devout, you should understand that it's anti-Biblical, as well as blasphemy. The link is the same as the italics copypasta underneath. Written by a Southern Baptist Convention stuffed suit, no less:

[Why theocracy is terrible — false claims to speak for God](https://www.timesleader.net/opinion/why-theocracy-is-terrible-false-claims-to-speak-for-god/article_dc13208c-fae3-11e7-8208-2384788ba598.html)

*""Some Christians might be confused watching coverage of the demonstrations in Iran. Many in the West identify the problem with the mullah-led government of Iran as not merely dictatorship but “theocracy.” These wondering Christians likely recognize that Iran’s authoritarian Islamic regime is wrong, yet they might wonder why we would use the word “theocracy” pejoratively. After all, the word simply means “rule by God.” Shouldn’t we aspire, they might ask, to just that: governments ruled by God?*

*Theocracies are awful and abusive, not only because they oppress human beings but because they also blaspheme God. New York Times columnist Bret Stephens calls Iran a “klepto-theocracy,” meaning that the claim to divine authority there is used to financially fleece their own people of money and property. That’s true, but it also is true of every theocracy.*

*To see why, a Christian does not need simply to look at the historical and sociological data on how these theocracies harm their own people; we can also see clearly why this is the case by looking at our own gospel. The central claim of the gospel is that, as the Apostle Paul put it, “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time” (1 Tim. 2:6). God rules and reigns through his Word, and his Word tells us that now is the time of God’s patience, when all people everywhere are called to repent of sin and find mercy in Christ (2 Pet. 3:9-10).*

*Does God intend to rule the entire universe, with his will done “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10)? Yes, but this kingdom is found in Jesus Christ, not apart from him. Jesus is the one anointed to rule over the cosmos, and anyone else who claims this is a pretender to the throne. Jesus himself has told us that in this time between his kingdom’s inauguration and his kingdom’s fulfillment, he is gathering a church of redeemed people, making a clear distinction between the church and the world (1 Cor. 5:12-13).Our call to the world at this point, Jesus tells us, is not to uproot the “weeds” in the garden (Matt. 13:29). We also are not to grab the sort of power that would cause people to pretend as though they were part of God’s kingdom — a kingdom that comes through the transforming power of the Word upon the heart — when they are merely cowering before earthly power. Our power comes by the open proclamation of the truth, not by the clattering of the sword (2 Cor. 4:2-3).*

*Jesus told us to beware those who claim messianic authority between his first and second comings. He will come to us the next time not through some person or committee claiming authority from God, but with obvious, indisputable, and unrivaled glory in the eastern skies. What is hidden now, seen only by faith, will be revealed then, perceived by sight.*

*Those who claim earthly rule now by divine appointment are, according to Jesus and his apostles, frauds. That’s true whether they are seeking a murderous rule over a nation, or whether in a more benign setting they are trying to use God’s Word to snuggle up to the local powers-that-be by promising a “Thus saith the Lord” in exchange for a place at the table. This is a claim to speak where God has not spoken. God has made clear, repeatedly, what he thinks of such (Ezek. 34:7-10).*

*When you hear a preacher on television tell you some “secret revelation” that God has made known to him or her, watch your wallet. Behind that, there’s usually a ploy for your money or your power. The result of this sort of fraud is not just the manipulation of countless people, but the tearing apart of the name of God himself. This will be addressed at Judgment Day. That same tendency is magnified by violent and authoritarian regimes that claim to speak for God, so that they cannot be questioned for their morality or their competence. They are always, in every situation, oppressive because they wish to use God’s glory and God’s authority without God. Behind all of that is idolatry, the worship of the gods of this age: financial gain or political power or sexual pleasure.*

*God has told us how to come into his rule: by following the self-sacrificial way of the crucified Christ. That entails a call to carry the gospel to the nations, not to subdue them for our own gain. That entails a call to consciences to hear and to receive the gospel, not to run over consciences with threats of death or of loss of money. Theocracies are terrible, because the god behind them is the root of all the horrors of the present age: a depraved humanity pretending to be divine.""*"
4,1 star review coming right up!
5,Reviewing a 1 just for them doing this 😅
6,"We dont just want to over throw the country we live in (and claim all to yourselves) but overthtow all governments 

Christians and 90s movie villains"
7,"If they wanted a ""parallel Christian society"", they'd all move to Santa Maria Town, a theocratic hellhole in Florida founded by a former CEO of Domino's Pizza where every move you make is monitored and any ""unchristian"" activity is grounds for eviction. Except they don't want that; they want to control the lives of other people, not out of any desire to ""save"" them, but just to hurt them and feel better about themselves.

Kinda surprised DeSantis hasn't moved the capital there yet."
8,"Don’t buy any books off Amazon, how can it be rated on best seller before being released?"
9,"Books like this are just christian nationalists howling at each other in an echo chamber.

I mean, who else wants to read this delusional garbage?"
10,"That's some crazy logic they have there. ""OMG! Can you believe people are rating this book one star even though they haven't read it? Anyways, if you could rate it five stars before it's released, that would be totally awesome."""
11,Just gave it a 1 star review 👍🏻
12,"It's about this book [https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Nationalism-Biblical-Dominion-Discipling-ebook/product-reviews/B0BCV58B4K/ref=cm\_cr\_dp\_d\_show\_all\_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all\_reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Nationalism-Biblical-Dominion-Discipling-ebook/product-reviews/B0BCV58B4K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews)

I am **not** telling to leave honest or negative reviews, just telling you that I did. So, yo do you okay?"
13,That 'Jesus Christ is King' at the end is so cringe!
14,There are too many of these books on Amazon already.
15,I’ll bet they are outselling books about the dangers of Christian nationalism. Most people don’t need a book to see how dangerous theocracy is
16,"""Silent, passive observers"" my ass hole. They're loud af and won't shut up about how oppressed they are."
17,"Went to bomb these turds with negative reviews and learned something quite interesting…a lot of these Pro Christian Nationalist books have reviews turned off….hmmmm, wonder what that’s about? Ha ha"
18,Do you have to buy a book on there so we can leave a 1 star rating?
19,"Just curious, what does it mean when you disciple a nation?"
20,The reviews need to nuke that book.
21,"Still waiting for the ""You don't like it? Then leave"" crowd to pack their bags..."
22,"> Gab's first book, Christian Nationalism, is being released tomorrow and us currently sitting in the #10 spot as a bestseller across all of Amazon.

Hmmmmm, I wonder if that's true. Lets find out:

> Best Sellers Ranks:

> 24 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)

> 1 in Nationalism (Books)

> 1 in Christian Spiritual Warfare

I do like it whenever some fruitcake is spruiking their book as number 1 on Amazon (or 10, in this case), and when you look it up you find it's actually number 1 on Amazon only in some weird ass catagory like ""Christian Spiritual Warfare""."
23,"It's on spot #24 right now, still way too high"
24,This is against Amazon's rules and it is a good way to get your item removed off the site.
25,I don’t recall Jesus supporting nationalism. 🤔
26,"Just ask your god to do it. After all, he can do anything."
27,">Christians are once again going to get involved in all areas of public life

“Once again”? I didn’t know the fundies had ever stopped."
28,Fuck you…look it up
29,"Come back to us with your review, please."
30,"Send me a copy, please."
31,"The last time Christian Nationalism was tried was in Germany, in the 1930's and 1940's. The slogan *""Gott mit uns""* ornamented the uniforms of Christian Nationalists who genocided literally millions of innocent people in the most sickening and horrific atrocity of the 20th century.

It was not so long ago that we need to rely on history books. This is still in the memory of people still living who experienced it first hand."
32,It works in Islamic countries where It keeps those pesky women under control
33,"Christian Nationalists would much rather command a poorly functioning theocracy than be a mere citizen of a decently run secular democracy. The former still nets them more power, control and resources.

And of course it helps when they sincerely believe a Christian Nation will be prosperous under their God inspired leadership..."
34,username checks out
35,Preorder and/or wishlist?
36,It told it wasn't eligible for review.
37,"Yeah, I wondered about that as well. I am pretty sure it doesn't involve spanking.

As somebody who isn't American, we can sit back and watch the religious crazies do their thing in the US and just be happy that we are living in a secular country.

But if a theocracy ever arose, or even just a small group of Christian Nationalists came into power like Trump did, then suddenly not so funny.

The US has not only got the ability to 'disciple' other nations but also to bring on the armageddon if some religious nut gets their hands on the button."
38,Oooh spicy! Be a shame if OP were to send this screenshot to Amazon then~
39,"The Nazis weren't Christian (the top party members, anyway) but the Christians certainly didn't  stand in their way. Many protestant priests were explicit collaborators while the catholic church kept a low profile and let others sort the whole thing out. If the nazis had won, they'd probably have integrated and arranged themselves with them, the way the russian Orthodox church does with the russian government. 

Reminder that the term ""Judeo-Christian culture"" wasn't a thing until the Holocaust happened and hating jews suddenly  wasn't OK anymore."

41,"Coincidentally those countries tend to be places with poor economic performance, poor cultural and scientific output and exports which consist primarily of raw materials and people who want to live somewhere else."
42,"Yes. Yes, the open marriage after 40 just totally gives it away. Ya got me."
43,"haha I would never be in the middle of doing that right now!

Edit: after fighting with the bot a bit, I got connected to a person and was able to provide screenshots and links. They assured me the issue was being elevated, I suppose we'll see."
44,"The Nazis definitely were Christian. Hitler stated that he was a ""German Christian"" in a speech. I'll agree that he was trying to use religion to help solidify his rule, but given that he criticised atheism throughout his tyranny I'd reckon that there's a slim chance he wasn't some denomination of Christian."
45,">Nazis were definitely not a theocracy. Where the fuck did you get that idea?

I didn't say they were. Nazi's were Christian Nationalists, operating in an Autocracy.

>If you wanna see failed theocracies just look at another middle eastern religion that doesn't believe in separation of state and religion...

Theocracies fail. Monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, tend towards stability. There's important nuances I think you're neglecting. For instance many laws of Saudi Arabia are religious laws, as opposed to secular laws, yet it is an absolute Monarchy, not a Theocracy.

In a Theocracy, priests rule the government. Nazi Germany was not run by priests nor any specifically designated *""holy men""* or leaders of any religious organization. It was run by a Dictator, the leader of a Nationalist party of Christians, I.E. an Autocracy of Christian Nationalists.

You don't need a Theocracy to be Christian or be a Nationalist. Theocracy can be a goal of Christian Nationalists *(which among the current movement of lunatics in the US it very much is)*, but it's not a requisite. You can have an Oligarchy, Autocracy, Monarchy, or even a Democracy, and be a Christian Nationalist."
46,"Also, those countries happen to be the same countries that Bible thumping nitwits hate the most."
47,Sounds like the USA
48,Good because I'd hate to be seen as having condoned such behavior ;)
