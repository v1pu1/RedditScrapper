1,"Remember everyone.

Always ask what God they are talking about. Tilts them."
2,"Because it is presenting itself as religious zeal.

You know that trend of people holding up John 3:16 signs at sports games?

That was started by a guy whose family and friends watched him slip deeper and deeper into insanity and did nothing about it because he was doing ""gods work"".

Eventually gods work escalated from being a serial Jumbotron photobomber to being a serial stink bomber, setting off several devices at *Christian* establishments he considered heretical.

He was arrested after a standoff with police after he tried to kidnap two men and force them to join him in his holy mission.

He is currently serving 3 life sentences."
3,"If the game is to name 3 hard to dispute facts that involve a word and then a made up thing that also fits that word and that proves it, I can come up with lots of examples that work.

""If numbers are infinite, YOURE A FOOL IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE and numbers describe everything, and possibilities are infinite, and time, as far as we can prove is infinite, these are facts, then how can you say pongo the golden space rhinoceros who is also infinite is not real? Admit he exists and live by the law of pongo, come to our orgies or you will be squashed in the great stampening"""
4,"I mean, I see it as a mental illness if that helps. Not everyone though, but the people who act like this absolutely"
5,"To be fair, if a supernatural being ripping of the fabric of space-time itself appeared in front of me from nowhere, doing insane shit like changing day to night, I would do what he says for sure. But we don't have any super powerful god, we have a book talking about it."
6,">You sound psychotic

Hold my beer."
7,I see people like this on YouTube all the time lol it’s crazy
8,"literally just regurgitating arguments used against them, but they dont make sense when applied to not believing, in my opinion"
9,"""better than the next 10 ancient narratives combined."" That reads straight up like Trump speech. Also, it's complete BS, but that doesn't matter. They just assert that it's true and use the god awful cherry picked arguments they heard from some pastor or something. I know this because I somewhat feel into it when I was still religious. I heard some very well put together speeches from charismatic rabbis and read some books that sounded smart that actually did a decent job of convincing me of Gods existence, and specifically that God gave the Torah directly to the Jews at Sinai. As I got older, I realized all the arguments were still ultimately based on faith and just asserting the truth, rather than actual historical and scientific evidence.

Also, if god actually straight up spoke to me, and I was capable of determining that it wasn't a delusion, ya, I might actually listen to him. Unless he was being a dick"
10,"Sir, this is a Wendy’s"
11,my mind cant comprehend the levels of stupidity i just saw
12,This hurts because I used to talk like this. Ugh haha
13,"If god tells me to get an abortion, is that cool?"
14,I bet they're very fun at parties
15,"I really hate people who say there is no beauty in science. The world is so beautifully organised, every life-form (except debatably humans) doing their part to keep the earth a habitable planet"
16,"I *think* it is, in certain circles."
17,The person with no philosophical constructs is the person with the religion that forbids any outside philosophy. I wonder where he got the idea that Christianity represents a well balanced philosophical perspective with no need to venture  outward 🤔 🙄

19,"""Historicity?"""
20,"I’m sorry, but if you’re going to tell me that I know nothing about (pretty much) all of life, but you’re doing so in a condescending manner and with multiple grammatical, spelling, and overall linguistic errors…I just cannot take you seriously. Toss in some nutty religious beliefs and I’ve totally tuned you out."
21,"My favorite part is how everything stated is in fact ""material"""
22,"I like to missgender god.

Or am I misgendering her? Does god have a gender?"
23,"I need a source, because that is amazing"
24,"That's a great pitch, I'm in. Where do I sign?"
25,Thank you for not bunching everyone who believes in a God all together. Some are decent people and some are total nut cases.
26,"With no eyewitness testimony, no actual proof outside of maybe at most heresay and conjecture (and that’s if you use the loosest definitions), with direct contradictions between the various letters… it just goes on.  I openly don’t understand where people can stand up and say that this is somehow proof of anything other than someone wrote something."
27,Only if you get a note.
28,I'm a dude.
29,He is woman. No sorry she is a man.
30,"So god is a lady. I know because I got her sopping wet, and then I gave god’s junk her just desserts."
31,It or they/them? I don't know. Never found a god who could answer.
32,"Since Adam is made in God's image, they're either male or more plausibly hermaphrodite."
33,"Funny you should say that, in traditional Judaism god has no gender or sex: Although the gender of God in Judaism is referred to in the Tanakh with masculine imagery and grammatical forms, traditional Jewish philosophy does not attribute the concept of sex to God. At times, Jewish aggadic literature and Jewish mysticism do treat God as gendered. The ways in which God is gendered have also changed across time, with some modern Jewish thinkers viewing God as outside of the gender binary. Guillaume Postel (16th century), Michelangelo Lanci (19th century), and Mark Sameth (21st century) theorize that the four letters of the personal name of God, YHWH, are a cryptogram which the priests of ancient Israel would have read in reverse as huhi, “heshe,” signifying a dual-gendered deity."

35,You made this account 10 days ago to troll this subreddit I'm assuming?
36,"Agreed!


Some are good DESPITE believing in God. 


FTFY"
37,"Someone surely saw God. People also have seen every kind of fantasy shit, people can hallucinate. It's just ""the word of God"" means nothing, a being so powerful would have ways of proving it exists."
38,"Ancient Books Are…  Ancient

Ancient Wisdom Is…. Ancient

Writings from past millennia and past centuries sometimes hold nuggets of truth, inspiration, and insight. But, the majority of these older writings tend to be complete garbage since they are steeped in the ancient understandings of the time.

It’s disturbing that so many people cherry pick their beliefs from these ancient texts."
39,I'm not surprised.
40,"Oh, hey, God. Is Jesus still down for that party on Saturday? Dionysus was looking forward to his ""water to wine"" trick, hate to let him down."
41,"So many questions.

Do you have male genitalia?

If so, do you have a sexual partner except 13 year old virgin children (totally can consent to an all powerful entity, right god?).

If not, do you masturbate? If not, is it because it's a sin? 

An omnipotent, megalomaniac, virgin (except the child rape/ cuckolding thing that one time) that DOESN'T masturbate..

Honestly it makes a lot of sense in the way you created life with so much suffering and still demand worship without providing proof of existing.

  Nice parenting btw."
42,He’s a dude
43,"That's what you think, ma'am..."
44,r/usernamechecksout
45,"god is a schwah. What's a schwah? Nobody knows, because schwah is a god."
46,God is queer. Got it.
47,And he's upvoting himself with his main. Hilarious.
48,Surprised you haven't seen my comments before.
49,"> believe in a God

> decent

> nut cases

Pretty sure I covered that."
50,Ergot has certainly participated in divine visions throughout history.
51,Sexist much?
52,He'll be there with bells on.
53,"Lol

> without providing proof of existing.

I'm right here. You're obviously not a believer. Why do you seem so butt hurt?"
54,She’s a dude
55,It's the only account I got.
56,"They’re not commenting about the first time they saw your comments. They’re commenting about the fact you can literally click someone’s account and see the day they made it. It’s not that they THINK your account is only 10 days old because they didn’t see your posts prior, it’s because they can objectively know that you don’t have any posts from then lol"
57,">Why do you seem so butt hurt?

As omniscient as you are real.

To answer your question child bone/nerve cancers, holocaust... last 200 years malaria cost two hundred million people their lives, smallpox nearly half a billion deaths, lawyers.

Oh no. I definitely believe in you, and I believe Satan didn't lie to us about eating fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

You are not a righteous entity.

Regardless, be well god.

Take note, I just wished you fortune without mandatory animal blood sacrifices, crusades, stoning gays, or filicide as payment for my blessings of well-being. You should try that."
58,Hey sorry to butt in... Between me and you I don't think that's really god your talking to.
59,So you're saying. He's made up too? That gods and demons are us the whole time?!
60,You may never know.
