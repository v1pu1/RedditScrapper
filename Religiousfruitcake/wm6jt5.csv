Now I’m curious. How do you know pigs enjoy wrestling with humans? 😄

Lol, no seriously, they think so because that’s what they keep doing whenever they meet an atheist. Literally every time I told believers about my lack of faith — after they directly *asked* me, mind you — they would immediately question how I could not believe in God and usually start to lecture me! The audacity! I give a one-word reply to a specific question, but they’ll just see it as an invitation to unload their missionary urges. It’s like dick pics! If it’s such a great thing, how come you gotta pursue unwilling people with it? Even those that otherwise displayed nearly zero interest in 'their' 'religion' (and mostly even less knowledge about it) would jump at it like they were fucking hypnotised and this was a trance word to kick off an order! Probably because they indeed are. 

Several had the audacity to question my intellect and outright call me stupid just because I don’t believe in God. (Joke’s on them, statistics prove the exact opposite relation lmao.) Almost all were extremely condescending and patronising (""you’re so young and know very little yet"" [nah you fungus, I was half your age and already knew waaaay more than ten times as much] or ""when you’ll grow up you’ll understand"" [been told that on multiple occasions; last time I heard that, I was like 26 or 27] and a lot more belittling and mansplaining shit like that). 

Others would hyperventilate and go into an incredulous, incoherently babbling ""but how???"" loop, as if an atheist is something so utterly outlandish and unthinkable they couldn’t even fathom what they’d just heard. Some just instantly started to fling insults at me. One guy threatened to hit me if I didn’t immediately ""admit"" God was real. I told him I gave him a honest answer to his own question. Would he rather I lied, which his God, if he existed, by all accounts regards as a sin? And when you ask, let alone *force* people to sin, I told him, that’s actually worse than sinning yourself, for then you’re purposefully corrupting other souls… like the devil does. (Guy actually went pale over that. 🤣) Thus, I asked, what do you want me to do? Be a honest atheist or corroborate the existence of a being that, if it were real, would condemn you for doing the devil’s work? Needless to say, he didn’t have any better reply than to bark ""shut up"" at me and walk away brusquely. Wasn’t the only threat of violence btw, just the crudest one. But the others were rather thinly veiled too.

Oh and I don’t live in a place like Saudi Arabia or the Bible Belt, mind you! I live in one of the most liberal areas of Germany! But with the exception of other atheists, the reaction to admitting to being godless is usually passive-aggressively if not openly hostile. Even atheists are often going out of their way to simp to religion and point out just how much they *respect* it and how ""valuable"" it supposedly is to those who ""need"" it (what a terribly patronising idea btw!) Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett call it faith in faith and it commonly survives the shedding of religion by a long time, with only few and far between pleasant exceptions.

I feel like it got a bit better during the last decade, maybe thanks to several influencers being openly godless on social media. But I’m still a bit cautious whom I tell. Certainly not idiots that will project their own habits onto atheists.
Which brings us back to the favourite hobby of God’s arguing albeit argument-less anti-atheist army [of people who desperately need a decent hobby] aka AAAAAAA! (This is their emblem. —> 😡🤬🤯) They project their argumentative ineptitude, stupidity, patronising attitude, hatred, anger, bigotry, prosecution complex and general craziness on atheists real hard. 

Like, it’s literally THEM demanding to be told if you believe in God during a random convo… or legit walking up to people and asking in an aggressive bad cop interrogation tone… or suddenly turning even harmless small talk into a theological debate of a reality TV worthy level of craziness entirely unsolicited… *and then* frothing and attacking people, when all they do is simply voice reasonable doubt, or tell them THE VERY TRUTH THESE NUTS SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR about their personal beliefs and (mostly politely) rejecting their unwanted proselytising attempts. Constitutionally protected beliefs, I might add. It encompasses a lack of religion too. 

But it’s not like religious fruitcakes don’t generally believe everyone’s private (and even most intimate) matters are automatically their business. Or that they get to discriminate against people because another bigoted nutcase like them, except he lived millennia ago and they don’t have even *that little* of an excuse, wrote about it in an ancient book. Luckily more and more people are awakening to their abuse and start to put them in their place. In actuality, their obsolete BS is becoming more ridiculous by the day. Which is precisely why they’re absolutely losing it rn.

I can tear such people to shreds in an argument easily ofc (and with their own superstitions too, if necessary). But my time is a privilege that you either have to pay for or earn by adding value to it. And they’re neither interesting nor intelligent, let alone decent or kind, or in any way pleasant to be around, so why would I give it to them? Least of all they’re original, but have you noticed how they somehow ALL manage to come with the delusional belief to be the first one to bring up the crudest, oldest, stupidest low-effort cliches to an atheist? They’re like those gross assholes that tell lesbians they just haven’t had the right man yet and unwaveringly believe *their* particular mediocre little boneless meat stick of questionable hygiene will just 🪄 *magically* change her sexual orientation overnight. Fr, it’s like they all roll off the same assembly line somewhere! Particularly since there’s such a major overlap between these two groups. For the males, the Venn diagram is basically a circle. So it’s (almost) exactly as you said. 

Except pigs are actually really smart animals (and their personal hygiene is often better too, they’re actually very cleanly animals and only roll in dirt because they can’t sweat and need the mud to cool down). I don’t like to insult poor innocent 🐖 by calling these nutcases pigs or alleging a swine would enjoy *that*. If they could speak, I’m sure we’d have way more intelligent conversation with them!

How about cigs 🚬 instead? They’re messy, make a stink, produce a lot of smoke without a fire, annoy people, make many sick and miserable, stifle your ability to breathe freely, require legal regulation for people to be safe from a highly addictive poison the dangerousness of which is frequently underestimated, never actually provide the calm and relaxation they promise and best of all, can be backronymed as Christian idiotic garbage-spewers!"

How do you resolve the problem of evil without contradicting any aspect of your definition? Infinite charity combined with any sensible definition of omnipotence would require that everyone has all that they need, and nothing less.

I would think that yes, god is fully omnipotent. I will gladly hear out your paradoxes and try to provide an anwser that best resonates withy knowledge and expierience.

The problem of evil? You just asked an excellent question. Well, many folks before us considered this exact conundrum, and the theological construct known as ""theodicy"" was born. Now, there is a shit load of material for me to cover here, and if I went by every single source one by one I'd probably would forget what was I even wring about, but here is the jist of it:
The most common theodicy is free will theodicy, which lays the blame for all moral evil and some natural evil on humanity's misuse of its free will. Augustinian Theodicy theorizes that natural evil is either a punishment for sin or the result of the disturbance of the order of things through acts of moral evil. A disturbance in the Earth’s ecology, for instance, might be brought about by human greed and the exploitation of natural resources. The Irenaean view, by contrast, looks to the future and assumes an evolutionary perspective. Adam’s sin is seen mainly as a lapse due to weakness and immaturity. The Fall From Eden is understood not as a catastrophe for the human race but as something from which humans can learn. In this account, the world is seen as a mixture of good and evil, an environment of growth and development in which humans can mature toward the perfection for which they were created by God. Both the Augustinian and the Irenaean approaches appeal to free will: the occurrence of moral evil (and, for Augustine, natural evil) is the inevitable result of human freedom. These views are based on the assumption that, because free will is good, both in itself and because it enables individuals to take responsibility for their own actions, God permits sin (moral evil) as the price of freedom. Although Augustine stressed the “fallenness” of the natural world, both he and Irenaeus paid tribute to its beauty, intricacy, and suitability as an environment for human life.  One  might argue the regularities of natural events (which can harm human beings as well as benefit them) are a necessary condition of both an individual’s moral growth and his intellectual development. Thus although fires and floods are dangerous and destructive, they offer people opportunities to exercise virtues such as bravery and self-sacrifice and to take steps to make themselves safer in the future.

There is also the possibility of other reasons that we are simply not fit to see as humans, same as ants would not understand what they are looking at when approaching a circuit board. I advise you look personally into this."
50,"

The Bible says that God created hell for Satan and the wicked angels who rebelled against Him, but there are people in hell also (Matthew 25:41). Both angelic beings and human beings are in hell for the same reason, sin (Romans 6-23).

Because God is completely righteous and morally perfect (Psalm 18:30), He always does what is right—there is no “darkness” in God, not the smallest speck of imperfection (1 John 1-5). God Himself is the standard for what is right, good, and moral. If it were not for God being the standard of moral perfection, created beings would have nothing to measure themselves against. In other words, if God is perfectly righteous, then anything that falls short of said perfection is sinful, and every human being who has ever lived, since Adam’s fall from grace, has committed sin (Romans 3:23). Because Adam sinned, the entire human race now has a sinful nature (Romans 5-12). But people do not go to hell because of Adam’s sin; they go to hell because of their own sin, which they freely choose (James 1:13-16).

Since God is eternal, immutable, and infinite, and all sins are fundamentally against God, God has decreed the just punishment for sin must also be eternal (Mathhew 24:46). There is another aspect to consider, which is that God also created people to live eternally. So when someone commits a sin against another person, the offended person has also been eternally wronged.

God, therefore, has deemed all who commit sin will go to hell because they have failed to meet His righteous standard; they have broken His Law of moral perfection. If God did not send people to hell for breaking His laws, it could be said that God is not just (Psalm 7:11). A good analogy is a court of law with a judge and a lawbreaker. A just judge will always convict the person who has been found guilty. If that judge did not pursue justice for the crime, he would not be a just judge (Deuteronomy 32:4).

However, the good news is that God is also merciful. In His rich mercy, He made a way for sinners to avoid the punishment of hell by trusting in the atoning work of His Son, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:9). For Christians, the penalty of sin has been removed and placed upon Christ on the cross (1 Peter 2:24). Because of the sacrifice of Christ, God is still just—the sin is punished—yet He is also merciful to all who believe."
51,"You know what? If you are 100% dead set on believing that there is no god, just dont read this comment further. If you decide to remain sceptic no matter what evidence would I provide you would still shrug it off. 

If you are still reading, then ket me explain. God loves us unconditionally. That is why he has provided man with free will, so he would not be slave neither to him nor to anyone else. That is why he sacrificed his only Son, Jesus Christ - so every human had a Chance at redemption. It is his love that motivated him to do so. He loves us, by calling as out from the darkness of sin i to the light, so we are not eternally damned. Why would he do that if he didn't care? God’s love is shown by justifying us (or declaring us innocent) by grace through faith in Christ. Christ is treated as if he were the sinner, and the sinner is treated as if he were the righteous one. God now sees us through Christ’s righteousness instead of through our sin. God shows His love for us by not only forgiving us of our sins, but by going even further and bringing us into His family. He has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints. This inheritance includes salvation, strength, hope, peace, comfort, providence, and fellowship. Finally, God shows His love by glorifying us. Throughout our lives we’ll wrestle with sin, but we’re promised that the good work God begins in us will be completed. When we go to be with the Lord our sinful nature will be left behind and we’ll like Him, and with Him, forever.

God’s glorifying love is the ultimate destination for Christians.

Look, if you want to remain an atheist, I shall troubke you no further. I just wanted to ask of you a little bit of respect for people who actually believe in God. Why bother them if they never wronged you? And if they have indeed  wronged you, for no reason, then they will be held accountable for that action on Judgement day."

61,">The definition of God is beyond physical.

Telling me what your god isn't doesn't tell me what it *is.*

To me, the only objects that can coherently be said to exist are either physical, or conceptual. Is your god  a concept, or are you proposing a third state of being?

>As it is stated, we are unable to concieve the motives or intentions of God

Yet you claim it is loving. You are contradicting yourself.

>In the bible, god has been described as residing in heaven - even though from prayers, scriptures and ritual worship it is clear that God is also within, and without every human. (That falls under many interpretations, so take this as you will.)

What is ""heaven?""

If it's open to interpretation, then your definition is lacking.

>God is supposedly timeless: we dont know his age for sure: we know he was there during the big bang.

How do you know this?

If something is timeless, does that not mean it exists sans time? If something exists for zero seconds - that is, without time - that is equivalent to nonexistent.

>Omnipresence is simple - since he created everything, he is in in everything. (1 Corinthians 11:12). “ALL THINGS ARE OF GOD, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.”

How do you then distinguish god from not-god?

Does your god occupy every spatial coordinate inside, say, an electron? If so, how can you determine where, if anywhere, the electron ends and the god begins? And if your god is not physical, it cannot, by definition, occupy physical space.

>I would think that yes, god is fully omnipotent. I will gladly hear out your paradoxes and try to provide an anwser that best resonates withy knowledge and expierience.

I asked you to *define what you meant* by omnipotence. But you could start with the paradox of the stone, if you're an absolutist.

>The most common theodicy is free will theodicy, which lays the blame for all moral evil and some natural evil on humanity's misuse of its free will.

That is incoherent, and does not satisfy the problem.

Someone can have the will to commit evil, and lack the ability. Someone could intend to do evil, and be prevented from causing suffering in *all* cases by an omnipotent god.

I also do not accept the existence of libertarian free will, or free will of any sort. Also, what ""misuse of free will"" resulted in a child developing bone cancer?

>Augustinian Theodicy theorizes that natural evil is either a punishment for sin or the result of the disturbance of the order of things through acts of moral evil.

Any god that punishes evil with evil is, itself, evil. Augustine sacrifices the omnibenevolence of the problem, and thus fails to resolve it.

>A disturbance in the Earth’s ecology, for instance, might be brought about by human greed and the exploitation of natural resources.

Not in the vast, vast, *vast* number of cases acoss human history, no.

What ""exploitation of natural resources"" causes tsunamis?

And again, an omnipotent god could prevent all natural evil, and an omnibenevolent one would. It fails, again, and abjectly so.

>God permits sin (moral evil) as the price of freedom.

If your god cannot create a world with both free will and no evil, it is not omnipotent.

Is there free will in heaven? If so, is there evil in heaven? If a god can create a heaven with no evil and free will, why couldn't it create an earth in the same way?

>One might argue the regularities of natural events (which can harm human beings as well as benefit them) are a necessary condition of both an individual’s moral growth and his intellectual development.

An omnipotent god could create a world where people grow and develop without suffering. Another failure.

>Thus although fires and floods are dangerous and destructive, they offer people opportunities to exercise virtues such as bravery and self-sacrifice and to take steps to make themselves safer in the future.

Those virtues are only necessary due to natural evils. If no such evils existed, such virtues would be unnecessary.

>There is also the possibility of other reasons that we are simply not fit to see as humans

If your defense is that ""humans can't understand god,"" then you must retract any claims you make about your god. Because you *also* cannot understand it.

How would you know if your god was evil, and deceiving you regarding its nature? Do you have anything that is *falsifiable,* as I requested?"

Although I’m fully convinced that surely this time they can’t reach a lower low every time (nah, not really, I’m an awful cynic… but my *optimistic* side keeps telling me — uh, well… let’s say it really *tries* to believe that’s just not possible, because, you know, faith in humanity and stuff). <sigh> And yet, here we are. 

Like… WTF?!?! How do you even *get* such an idea?! (Damn autocorrect made it ""beget"" and cursed me with more mental images I never cared to know. Brain bleach! Brain bleach!) This is so sick and disgusting and just awful all around that it could’ve sprang only from the twisted minds of such pervy self-proclaimed prophets. 
Them and incels. Albeit incels actually kinda count too, because they consider themselves sort of the prophets (literally saw a few call it that) of their insane black pill ‘theory' and they subscribe to lots of the same alt-right and nazi BS, soo… yeah, pervy, self-proclaimed pseudo-prophets it will be. 

I guess we might as well add the political nuts under this category, because all the totalitarian ideologies ultimately exhibit religious qualities too. And they have a major overlap with other kinds of insane BS."
71,"at least he could visit it and you could physically see him, with god you cant"
72,"Why would I need to find proof that something you made up doesn't exist?  That's backwards. 

If you think something exists, prove it.  Don't ask us to prove the thing you imagined isn't real.  Because that's no more possible than you proving Unicorns aren't real.  

If you live your life as if Unicorns are real, eventually you're going to look really dumb when talking to sane, rational people."
73,"Distain? I do not hate anyone here. It is just annoying to see people taking pride of something so miniscule, spiraling themselves into this ""i am the smartest man alive 😎😎😎😎 christians owned again!"" mentality. Do you think there is no case of atheist, or antitheist acting precisely the same? The guy attacked my relligion, so I countered his claim. Was he not rude? Were my assumption incorrect? Please explain, maybe it is something wrong on my side."
74,"You know what? You have convinced me. I have re-done my research. 

Of course God is loving, kind, and merciful, but He is first and foremost a holy and righteous God. So holy is He that He cannot tolerate sin. He is a God whose anger burns against the wicked and disobedient (Isaiah 5:25; Hosea 8:5; Zechariah 10:3). He is not only a loving God—He is love itself! But the Bible also tells us that He hates all manner of sin (proverbs 6:16-19). And while He is very merciful, there are limits to His mercy. “Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon” (Isaiah 55:6 - 7).

God's mercy has limits. Sure. Does that make some sort of paradox that denies his existence? I can't see how.

I really doubt that you have a degree though."
75,"Are you... mocking me?

The Immutability of God is an attribute that ""God is unchanging in his character, will, and covenant promises."" God's immutability defines all God's other attributes: God is immutably wise, merciful, good, and gracious."
76,"Im not forcing people to go to church. I am trying to stop the hostile behaviour and negative opinion between believers and atheists. I think it is wrong that there is a raging war between them. People should love each other, religeous or not. The whole existance ofevil thing is a complicated matter - would you be okay if i copy a comment i made before and paste it here? Thanks.



The problem of evil? You just asked an excellent question. Well, many folks before us considered this exact conundrum, and the theological construct known as ""theodicy"" was born. Now, there is a shit load of material for me to cover here, and if I went by every single source one by one I'd probably would forget what was I even wring about, but here is the jist of it:
The most common theodicy is free will theodicy, which lays the blame for all moral evil and some natural evil on humanity's misuse of its free will. Augustinian Theodicy theorizes that natural evil is either a punishment for sin or the result of the disturbance of the order of things through acts of moral evil. A disturbance in the Earth’s ecology, for instance, might be brought about by human greed and the exploitation of natural resources. The Irenaean view, by contrast, looks to the future and assumes an evolutionary perspective. Adam’s sin is seen mainly as a lapse due to weakness and immaturity. The Fall From Eden is understood not as a catastrophe for the human race but as something from which humans can learn. In this account, the world is seen as a mixture of good and evil, an environment of growth and development in which humans can mature toward the perfection for which they were created by God. Both the Augustinian and the Irenaean approaches appeal to free will: the occurrence of moral evil (and, for Augustine, natural evil) is the inevitable result of human freedom. These views are based on the assumption that, because free will is good, both in itself and because it enables individuals to take responsibility for their own actions, God permits sin (moral evil) as the price of freedom. Although Augustine stressed the “fallenness” of the natural world, both he and Irenaeus paid tribute to its beauty, intricacy, and suitability as an environment for human life.  One  might argue the regularities of natural events (which can harm human beings as well as benefit them) are a necessary condition of both an individual’s moral growth and his intellectual development. Thus although fires and floods are dangerous and destructive, they offer people opportunities to exercise virtues such as bravery and self-sacrifice and to take steps to make themselves safer in the future.

There is also the possibility of other reasons that we are simply not fit to see as humans, same as ants would not understand what they are looking at when approaching a circuit board. I advise you look personally into this."
77,"And they will burn in hell for that. 
I agree.


John 13:34-35 
“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

This line was supposed to stop all the hompohobia and nasty shit. But people keep using religion to further their agenda."
78,"If you are so dead-set on it, then would my words really change anything? Even if i provided legitimate evidence? Relligion deserves the tiniest crumb of respect for the sole reason that it tries to help people. To make them act better, kinder. To help others in need. To respect the right people. Im not really sure what you are achievieng by plugging your ears and talking over someone. You are right in one regard - belief is not meritorious. But following the Word of God in trying to become a better person to themselves, and to other people, to offer kindness and help - that is praiseworthy."
79,"Hey, I mean, thats respectable. If you said that sentence in public, i dobt really think anyone could get mad at you. Its not hostile. So thanks for habing this conversation with me :D"
80,What do you mean by that?
81,"I can't physically see wind, or air, yet I can see it's effects. The same thing goes for God."
82,"Before i explain, could you please tell me what donyou think about this article?

(Unicorns were kinda real btw. Check out Elasmotherium sibiricum on google.)"
83,"His question wasn't an attack.  The attack was all based on the assumptions YOU brought in.  All you are doing now is arguing that your assumptions are correct.  It doesn't matter.  

""Define God""

""Stop hurling insults"""
84,"Go fuck yourself for calling me a liar, you insufferable jackass.

Btw, using scripture to “prove” your point is utterly pointless. First I’d have to concede that scripture is in any way reliable and not just decently preserved ancient near eastern mythology."
85,"Lol. This is absurd. You are absurd.

The god of the Bible is not wise, good, or any of the things you listed. That god is a narcissist, capricious, immoral dickhead who is in no way worthy of worship."
86,"oh, sweet heart, as i already said that english is not my mother tongue, your speech is so complicated that i will force you too, to use a translator, with all its approximations of translations (you know , like the Bible: Hebrew or Aramaic -Ancient Greek-Latin- Modern languages), if you can.

Je suis une vraie myrmécologue amateure, donc parle-moi des fourmis et je me sentirai chez moi! Si une colonie de fourmis peut découper sa reine pour s'évader par le seul trou possible, bien trop petit, comment savons-nous que nous sommes pas trop stupides par rapport à l'entité créatrice?

Quand je nourris ou abreuve les colonies de fourmis de ma maison et mon jardin, je sais qu'elles ne me conçoivent même pas. 

(I'll help you) I don't expect any sacrifice or veneration from my familiar ants or spiders. I just want to help them to live. I never flood them because of their lack of devotion.
I love people and respect all of them. You're happy with your religion? Great for you, I don't care if you're Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Bouddhist, Satanist, or Monster Spaghetti adept.
I don't care think, I just want everybody could live their lives as they want and respect each others. Morality isn't only Christian, lot of atheist have a great one. 


You ""advised"" me to look personnaly on it, why? Who do YOU think you are to advised me? Your opinion means nothing for me, sorry. Maybe, if I knew you and recognize you as a model to follow... But the fear of hell you feel means nothing for me. I don't know you, I don't know if you're a good human.

I wish you a good day (night or evening) and I just hope a better inclusive World for all. 💜💙💚💛♥️"
87,"That just brings up the unjust nature of eternal punishment for finite crimes. Truly no one is so evil that they should be punished for an infinite amount of time. Wouldn’t a thousand years, or a million years be sufficient? Considering that most people have trouble contemplating how long something finite like a million years is. Wouldn’t a good of love and compassion and forgiveness NOT want to condemn people to hell for all eternity? Add to that the apparent difficult demands to avoid it. Even things listed in the 10 commandments aren’t so black and white."
88,"Lol. Religion doesn’t exist to help people or make them better. Every good thing that has ever been done does not first require religion. It can be done without it just as easily. But every bad thing that has ever been done in the name of religion simply would have happened without it. Therefore, religion is a net negative in every sense. 

Religion exists to control and to serve itself, just as it has always been. 

Furthermore, there is no evidence that anything in religion is true, aside from some historical details. But those are found in other texts as well, so they stand as useless for proving the reliability of scripture. There is no evidence for the existence of  god. And if a god DOES exist, and yet has provided no evidence and is conspicuously absent, and that SAME god demands obedience and worship, then that is the ultimate argument for that god being just an enormous dickhead. I wouldn’t worship that god for any reason. 

“If god exists then he owes me an apology”"
89,And those effects you can see from God are?
90,"You totally can see wind, just not using visible light. Wind is just the motion of particles after all."
91,"Seeing effects *is* what seeing is. You’re seeing light reflected or refracted. You’re playing at words. This is the kind of thing that struck someone without a scientific background as a clever counter-argument a dozen centuries ago, and never got updated. It’s actually *worse* than the “you can’t see love” one, and that takes some doing."
92,You can with a powerful microscope
93,"Sure.  Moral arguments are irrelevant when trying to find evidence for the existence of something.  

You can make up a moral being.  You know... since it's made up you can make it anything."
94,"Im sorry that being sceptical hurt your feelings so much, but you need to understand, I have no evidence that your degree is legitimate, and accepting authority without evidence is simply unreasonable. Second of all, are you sure you are looking at this right? Changing your mind, or looking at something from a diffrent point of view is not ""conceding"". You aren't loosing anything, and that doesn't mean that the other side is smarter or better than you in any way. Meaning this in the nicest way possible, are you okay?  From my point of view you are putting way to much emotion and anger into a debate on a virtual website. My goal is not to condemn, or convert you into christianity. Im trying to change your outlook on religion, as while browsing the sub, I have been left with the impression that it is viewed in an extremely negative light, without anybsolid reason."
95,"I think otherwise, but if you are not keeping an open mind, none of my points will ever reach you, no matter if true or false. Is there even a point in arguing, if that is the case?"
96,"Je n'ai pas peur de l'enfer, et je ne vous recommande pas non plus de vérifier l'affaire par vous-même : c'était destiné à quelqu'un d'autre."
97,"Ill try to translate into french bur please dont make fun of me its been quite a while


Comme je l'ai déjà dit, je n'essaie pas de faire du prosélytisme. J'essaie de changer votre vision de la religion telle qu'elle est considérée injustement. Le commentaire que je vous ai donné est extrait d'une autre discussion.
Pourquoi vous attendez-vous à des sacrifices d'insectes ? Vous ne les avez pas créés, ne les avez pas engendrés. Les a aidés à grandir, oui. Vous ne leur avez pas demandé de dévotion, alors ils ne vous en donneront pas. Je suis satisfait de ma religion, mais je ne suis pas satisfait de la façon dont je suis perçu - un fasciste homophobe et de droite. Pareil pour les autres de ma communauté. C'est pourquoi je suis ici. Cela me fait vraiment mal de voir des gens religieux considérés comme des fanatiques délirants. Vous êtes français et la religion est perçue différemment dans votre pays, mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi vous seriez en colère contre moi pour la défendre.

This should be right?"
98,"Look, you are not alone.

Many people are uncomfortable, to say the least, with the idea of an eternal hell. This discomfort, though, is often the result of an incomplete understanding of three things: the nature of God, the nature of man, and the nature of sin. As fallen, sinful human beings, the nature of God is a difficult concept for us to grasp. We tend to see God as a kind, merciful Being whose love for us overrides and overshadows all His other attributes. Of course God is loving, kind, and merciful, but He is first and foremost a holy and righteous God. So holy is He that He cannot tolerate sin. He is a God whose anger burns against the wicked and disobedient (Isaiah 5:25; Hosea 8:5; Zechariah 10:3). He is not only a loving God—He is love itself! But the Bible also tells us that He hates all manner of sin (Proverbs 6:16-19). And while He is merciful, there are limits to His mercy. “Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon” (Isaiah 55:6-7)."
99,"I beg to differ. While its true that religion is not required for good to exist, it tried to lead people into the path of righteousness. Every bad thing done in the name of religion is usually stated as bad by that very religion. Crusades? The church does not accept them. Homophobia? Denied by John 31 34-35.

How is relligion serving itself? The coin you put on the platter? That is a gesture of good will, not necessery to enjoy a mass, and not required to participate or ""buy"" redemption. You seem very convinced about something without elaborating on it further 

Some historical details. Well, what do you beed to believe that religion is true? What would it take for you to actually change your mind?

And isn't the fact that these appeared in other sources, you know, proving that these weren't made up?

You know, I guess we'll both eventually find out when we die. Why worry about it?"
100,"His faith, which is another word for ""delusions""  It's funny because he probably thinks the Bible promises an afterlife with clouds and shit. It does not.  [https://youtu.be/ipiewC3QP-k](https://youtu.be/ipiewC3QP-k) sure we'd all like to be ""immortal"" in some way, but that's not gonna happen.  is there a point to existence? No. None at all. Be a good person, and you'll experience a good life and ""heaven"" on earth for 80 some years is all you get.  Don't waste it on church, or paying homage/brain cycles on stupidity/fairy tales.  What does all this life mean?!?... Who fucking cares, do what you can, and be happy."
