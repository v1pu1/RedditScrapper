7,"She is supposed to be taking care of the needs of her constituents.  Food, housing, medical care, college, civil rights.  Instead she is doing this.  The evil that thinks it’s the good 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮☹️🤮🤮🤮🤮☹️☹️🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮."

9,Please let there be a video of her speaking in tongues.
10,"What's been so depressing about the whole trump thing isn't finding out people this stupid, dishonest and delusional exist. I knew they did. It's that he showed them that they could get actual political power just by being the loudest, dumbest asshole in the room. And it's also revealed that there were more people who will vote for that then I would have guessed pre-trump."
11,Far cry 5 vibes
12,Look at all them Karens
13,Oh there’s no way you can pray the ugly away on that one

25,We in America need to purge these cultists from our government. They are actually hurting our country.
26,"I’ve lost faith in this species after the past 10 years. 

I mean we’ve probably been fucked since we figured out how to create atomic bombs and even just firearms but still."
27,Plot twist: they are really picking the lice out of her hair
28,Someone quote her the bible verse where it says women should STFU.
29,"I saw the picture in my feed, and all I could think of was ""Witches For JESUS""!!!! How is what they are doing in this picture any different than witchcraft which is condemned in their Bible?? Not that they ever read it, I wouldn't want to imply that.  🙏 🤣😃 I don't even think they believe a God is listening to any one of them, I think they just love the theatrical spectacle of it, to feed their narcissism."
30,*draws a mustache on her*
31,Why does I look like she uses this bullshit to feed her own ego and narcissism?
32,The woman on the left looks like that actor  from Waiting.
33,"In evangelical Christianity friends & family hold hands over someone asking for prayer or healing. The ""holy spirit"" is channeled by believers, and supposed to travel through the hands onto the receiver."
34,They believe they have the ability to cast magic spells. They wouldn’t phrase it like that but it is exactly what they think they are doing.
35,"They're laying hands on the ""prophetess""."
36,"[Trump did this, too.](https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-christian-leaders-4.jpg)"
37,A salon might actually fix that bad dye job of hers.

53,"Yep, makes total sense 🙄"
54,😂 totally!
55,What are you talking about? They consider themselves born again Christians.
56,We’d actually touch the person. I haven’t seen it done like this. People too far away when there’s a crowd will put their hands out in the direction of the person receiving
57,Is Trump the new 'Simpsons did it' for cringe?
58,What a weird dumb cult.
