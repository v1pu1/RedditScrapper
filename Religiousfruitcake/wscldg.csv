1,"“This is how I know you’re still poor, broke, busted and disgusted, because of how you have been honoring me. I’m not worth your McDonald’s money? I’m not worth your Red Lobster money? I ain’t worth your St. John Knits — y’all can’t afford nohow. I ain’t worth y’all Louis Vuitton? I ain’t worth your Prada? I’m not worth your Gucci?” he said in the nearly minutelong clip."

4,"As a watch fan:

Bro wanted a fucking MOVADO? Not even shooting for a Rolex or something?"
5,"To be fair, God REALLY wanted him to have that watch."

7,Cuz Jesus was all about material wealth. Piece of shit.
8,I would love to see Jesus walk into a Mega church these days. He would whip the shit out of everyone there
9,"Wow, if the Hell They warn about is real, this fella is definitely going there."
10,He ain’t sorry he acted that way. He is sorry the video got out to the mainstream and people now know how big of a piece of shit he is
11,At least he wasn't asking for a Rolex.

20,"Tbf, he's providing so much value to their lives, like... uh... let me get back to you on that."
21,"Wow I thought this was a tongue in cheek summary, it's crazy that this is a real quote

Tbf when he says 'I' he could be speaking on behalf of god (not that that's any better). But why would god want him to have an expensive watch?"
22,"That's true, they're doing our work for us. Opening people's eyes to how so much organised religion is for the purpose of greed and control. I wish more religious leaders were this honest, instead of ""you must pay your tithes and offerings, and the money will go to..."" *hides gold watch* ""...erm, to God!"""
23,God Cc’d me in the email can confirm he wants this douche bag to have a movado watch BAD
