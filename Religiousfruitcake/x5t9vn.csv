1,I still remember watching him debate Bill Nye. He had absolutely no valid points besides “there’s this book called the Bible….”
2,"So, modern technology was required to protect it from a simple storm. Yet somehow lacking the modern technology this less than seaworthy monstrosity was full of animals during a rainfall that would have instantly turned into super hot steam bath."
3,So he thwarted God?  Seems odd to use lightning protection if all your faith is in God.
4,"Reminder that Ken Ham's ""Ark"" once filed an insurance-claim for water-damage.

Anyone want to ask him why Yahweh wanted to strike his boat-shaped timber-barn with lightning?"
5,"“Reminds us” that if you protect your cosplay boat from lightning it’s protected because of science, not god"
6,So god tried to destroy his stupid boat by hitting it with lightning....but man-made technology saved it. This man thwarted his god's plan.
7,Ken Ham could piss in the woods and find a way to thank God
8,"""I better buy this lightning rod to protect this holy relic I'm building for God from God."""
9,Looks more like God's trying to destroy the ark
10,"Sound like God is trying to kill you, Ken."
11,Let me get this straight. If the gays build levees to prevent their gay houses from being destroyed by a hurricane or whatever then it’s god’s will they live and has thus saved them? Because don’t storms destroy evil according to this guy?
12,"His name is literally ""Ham""."
13,Surely god was trying to destroy the arch?
14,Wasn’t the lighting sent by god tho? If god created nature and all else he must have sent it and probably wanted to destroy that eye sore and these Noah’s ark cosplayers
15,Jesus is my lightning rod.
16,"Well he is right, that this book exists but nothing else."
17,"Have you seen Dave Farina debate Kent Hovind? It's another fucking level of comedy, he just repeats the same several sentences over and over like a broken record player."
18,"Ken Ham did think of putting actual animals on there but couldn't because it wouldn't be good living conditions.

I do think they do have a petting zoo basically and animals outside."
19,"And wasn't it denied because of an ""act of god"" clause? Irony at its best."
