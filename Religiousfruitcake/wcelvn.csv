1,"Science is flexible, new discoveries can add on or change existing theory. Adapting existing materials so that it works with new ones

Religion is fixed and authoritarian, any proposed changes to the system will be met with backlash. Don't you even dare question their methods. People treat it as infallible."
2,"Wow, that's really cool to have such well preserved specimens in that kind of abundance. Really brings our knowledge forward on this subject. Yay science!"
3,"https://phys.org/news/2022-07-million-year-old-fossilized-brains-stanleycaris-prompt.html

I don't see how it changes anything."
4,I wish respected sites like this wouldn't pander to uneducated creationists loons by using such hyperbolic titles for their articles. It just adds to the bullshit.
5,"You often get the sense these sorts didn't read the article, but it seems like they didn't even read the title in this case.

It: ""What these fossils are telling us about the evolution of these organisms...""

6,"That's likely because you lack the requisite knowledge of that particular tiny niche area of evolutionary biology.

I don't think anyone resonable is suggesting a paradigm shift in evolutionary theory as a whole as a result of this."
7,"No doubt, but the history of life is full of freaky stuff."
