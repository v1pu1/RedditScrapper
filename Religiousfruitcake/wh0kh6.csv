2,I think they’re implying that Gigachad wants to shear the wool off the trans and LGBTQ sheep… which I guess is a metaphor for conversion therapy?
3,I sometimes wonder if conservative Christians believe that Jesus would pose in front of the American flag with an automatic assault rifle.

27,"You would think if what you call sexual immorality was such a big deal, Jesus would have spoken extensively on it. He did not. 

You know what he did speak on? Judging other people. Loving your neighbour. He did speak about divorce and about adultery and many other topics. And not once about sexuality. Yet the church today makes little of divorce and judging and cruelty to others, yet bangs on about sexuality. Almost like the alleged teachings of Jesus and the book on which the religion is supposed to be based actually have very little bearing on the modern religion."
28,"Sexual immortality is pedophilia, rape or zoophilia. Any practice involving 2 consenting adults is not immoral.

And before you explain to me why your version of religion is the only one that's right (as every religious thinks it is), I just don't believe it. I believe in morality and tolerance."

33,"Except a minority of the Christian faith follows the Eastern Orthodox church, and I can pretty much guarantee that the origin of this ""meme"" isn't Eastern Orthodox. Besides,

>In the orthodox church, the word of God is held in the highest regard and everything else comes beneath it.

Funny that the Orthodox church does not actually take the word of the Bible literally then. For example, Eastern Orthodox refutes the immaculate conception, there are no official doctrines prohibiting tattoos, or shellfish, and according to official doctrines, divorce and remarriage is permissible in certain circumstances. All of these are explicit in the text of the Bible, and there isn't room for interpretation, however, the Bible does not explicitly define sexual immorality, yet people are quick to assume what they think ""God"" meant. Funny, almost as if it's what fits your lives culturally instead of taking the word of God as literal gospel."
34,"You know sex and marriage are two different things, right? And do you also know that the Bible is not a reference for the majority of humanity?

For other religions and atheists, it is just a book.

37,">The true church of Christ.

Proof? Other than the One True Scotsman proof? You can't even claim it's the religion that most closely followed the ""doctrine"", as the books of the Bible(s) have been cherry-picked by religious leaders.

>exual immorality, worship of emperors, brutality and so much more which goes against God's word were the cultural norm

So what you're saying is, like the Puritans in Europe, you're special brand of Christianity was a cultural pushback against a different culture, also much like American Christianity today, with the excuse of a religious text that has been co-opted to fit the narrative. Case in point, Leviticus has explicit bans on tattoos and shellfish among others things, yet that's not ""doctrine"" because it doesn't fit what a culture wants, evetnt though the claim is that the religion follows the ""word of God"". Surely if your god didn't mean those rules, they wouldn't have made it into the texts? 

Realistically, every religion is an interpretation of an already heavily edited set of texts, filtered through specific cultures to fit what is palatable for the adherents and useful to the religious organisation. If not, then two people with no prior knowledge on opposite sides of the world could read the Bible and come to the same conclusions and build the same religion (divergent evolution), which obviously would never happen."

41,"Again, proof that any of the religion is real? Any at all? No? 

And yes, I do think that all churches are heavily heavily influenced by culture, no matter whether it is the dominant religion or a persecuted one. Add I've said, a lot of religions/religious sects are formed in a reactionary way against a culture going in the opposite direction. Hedonism when the culture is restrictive/puritanical, and vice versa. It's a pattern repeated so often it's predictable. Religions borrow and co-opt traditions and rules from others and from others - that's why the same celebrations and traditions are repeated. 

What isn't repeated is the current interpretations of ""doctrine"", so no I don't think that two people reading the same Bible would come to the same conclusions and build the same religion, because otherwise there wouldn't be so many differing flavours of Christianity (even among Catholicism and Orthodox, the ""largest"" sects, there are numerous subgroups that have differing interpretations. Case in point, you think that divorce is not accepted at all in Eastern Orthodox, when most sources agree that it is more restrictive that civil divorce, but that there are options for divorce and remarriage). 

In any case, religion is a governing tool. Fortunately it's one that in most places in the world is separate from the actual government, so it is an optional set of guidelines in addition to civil laws, which adherents can choose to follow and non-adherents can ignore. The only issue is when actual governments try and impose religious doctrine on the populations, which should be opposed by everyone, religious or not (because your flavour might be in vogue right now but won't be tomorrow - any brief study of history will demonstrate that)."

45,">You asked me for proof that the orthodox church is the one Jesus founded

You have no proof of this either. There is no historical proof of the figure of Jesus, much less of him founding a church, never mind your specific church. You are using circular logic. Your church uses its own biased record of history and doctrine to claim it is the one church, the same as every other church.

>Didn't this already happen in history? There were 12 apostles, all experienced roughly the same, all heard roughly the same teachings of Christ

Funny, the gospels disagree with each other (and were likely not contemporary anyway).

>You said the church picked and chose the bible verses and interpreted the word of God, so that it fit the culture, but that's simply not true, and I think you realized this now.

No, I don't ""realise"" this. If your religion allows for divorce (it does) and drops what you call ""ceremonial rules"" arbitrarily (it does) and at some point your religious leaders chose which gospels to include in the Bible and which to discard (they did) then you aren't following some tome sent down from on high, you are following a cultural tradition. Tell me, how many books were discarded to make the modern bible?

>God's word is eternal

Then why are there different versions? Why would your god allow that? Why would it require translation? What proof is there that your book is the word of god, over any other book claiming the same?


>2. What are these subgroups? Do they disagree with fundamental church teaching? If yes, then they are heretical and not part of the church.

One True Scotsman. They don't disagree with the interpretation of their sect or church, only with yours."
46,Have a nice day.

48,"All I can say is that you are too far into your own circular arguments to step outside. Time and again you cite a single, biased source with no supporting evidence. If the Bible were true, there would be evidence outside of itself to support it. If your church were the one true church, there would be evidence and, crucially, there would be no claim from other churches of the same (or at least they would be easily refuted). They were using the same text as you, and coming to a different conclusion.

You are using the Bible to prove the Bible is true. It's not a logical proof. It's faith. You are entitled to your faith, but neither you nor any person of faith is entitled to push your guidelines onto others who do not ascribe to those teachings. They are not absolutes. They are not governing laws. They are things that you choose to believe, that others choose not to. So by all means, do not divorce, or commit what you believe to be sexual immorality, or do any of the other things you believe your religion prohibits. As long as you do not interfere with the rights of others to do as they choose, so long as each of you doesn't hurt the other."
49,[deleted]
50,"I'm not going to go around your circular beliefs again. You are misinformed, and you aren't using logic but faith. That's your choice.

I would just like to check based on your last comment - you have no belief that there should be any laws restricting people who are gay or transgender from living their lives as they see fit, including enjoying the benefits and legal protection of civil union. Any restrictions should be only if they are adherents to faiths that prohibit those activities, so at worst someone might be no longer welcome within a faith, but that no civil or other discrimination should apply?"

52,"1. Fine.

2. States shouldn't promote heterosexual marriage then, or any other kind of relationship. 

3. What gender anyone is, or the content of their underwear, is only your concern if you're their lover or their doctor. Otherwise, treat people as they ask, and they will do the same to you. 

4. So you would deny children medical care? Who decides what is allowed? You? Why not their parents and doctors? Why does your religious agenda supercede theirs?

5. Why? Why should faith be promoted? If we can't have a pride parade then absolutely the government should not be promoting religion, especially one religion over another. And ""traditional"" values - who decides that? If you were in Italy, do you mean Roman values? Or Catholic? Should America go back to Native traditions? Puritanism? Who decides what is ""traditional"" and when are we allowed to move away from the flaws of the past? And is this the romanticised past where everyone was chaste until marriage and went to church, or the true past where women were property, and first babies were often born 5 months after the wedding?

Let me ask you a question. What if the Jewish and Roman people of 2000 years ago had rejected new in favour of ""traditional values""? You would obviously assert that Christianity was progress over older religions, so what makes you certain that progress now isn't still in the right direction?"
53,[deleted]
54,"So, to summarise, you tolerate those who don't ascribe to your religion, but ultimately want to convert everyone and are happy to use the government to impose your made up rules on everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation. You do not understand the things that you think are wrong, and instead you allow your religious leaders to think for you, and your ability to have faith without proof means you do not seek answers or proof for yourself. You have no tolerance for atheists, and like to blame all the world's ills on a lack of religiosity, while never looking inward to the evils and oppression done in the name of religion. You want to oppress people in every aspect of their lives, from medical decisions to the most fundamental right of who and how and when we can love.

How Christian."
55,[deleted]
56,">I noticed you didn't even try to push back against all the arguments I made for that, lol

You made assertions, not arguments. You can't make a logical argument, therefore why would I try to correct you? You don't want to believe evidence over a book of dubious origins. I wouldn't waste my time. 

>But remember that there is a God

You can't even prove that, never mind anything else. There is no judgement except our own, but individually and collectively. 

>you falsely call it love

You wouldn't know love if it bit you. Your love and the love of your ""God"" is conditional and hateful. How dare you deride the love that gay or straight people have for one another just because it doesn't fit your  model.

>Because if everyone would follow the word of God, the world would be a way more peaceful, loving and happy world.

Another assertion without proof. I can assert that the world without religion of any kind would be much more peaceful. If I could be bothered, I'd say let's count religious and non-religious conflicts and see who is right, but honestly, you are tiring. You make assertions without proof. You say you are tolerant but want to involve the government in pushing your agenda. You judge the love that people have for one another while promoting hate. All you have done here is modelled exactly why religion is on a downward trend, and long may that continue."
57,[deleted]
58,"You don't want to promote hate, yet you asserted that any relationship outside of your church's narrow definition of relationships is not love. You cannot understand that people can be in love and also practice what your church would seem sexual immorality, and instead slander those relationships. 

>just informing about God's commandments.

How convenient that your god shares your prejudices so that you can be bigoted and claim no personal responsibility. Now if only he existed. 

>God's love is unconditional

As long as you worship mindlessly, and perpetuate the faith's bigotry. A loving god would not require worship. A narcissistic prophet or a money-grubbing power-hungry church, however, would."

60,">you mindlessly worship your atheism, too

You really don't understand atheism or worship, do you? I worship nothing. That's the point. 

>Noone goes through their life, constantly analysing everything

I analyse when someone wants me to believe something that I do not have proof for, or that suited their agenda. I'm sorry that some people go through life believing what they are told mindlessly."

62,"""Discuss"" but don't listen. What a waste of time. All you've done is proselytise. You're so mindless that you believe atheists worship."
63,[deleted]
64,">Everybody worships something, be it God, the disbelief in God, money, fame, knowledge, science, politicians, ideologies, philosophies, anything.

Worship is mindless following and adulation so no, not everyone worships something. Perhaps you need a wider circle of associates outside your church if you think that.


>But when you look at how atheists that really care about being atheists (so no european agnostics who simply don't care about religion)

Agnostics are not athiests. I care about religion (and shocker, I'm geographically European) because of the bigotry and damage it perpetuates. However, you might be right in that European athiests are less talkative about it because thankfully Europe is mostly secular in its government, and non-religiousness/athiesm is on the rise. Almost as if that leads to a better, healthier society where people don't have fight constantly against the state imposing religious dogma."
65,[deleted]
66,">Would you not say most people mindlessly follow something? The american dream, a specific goal you set yourself, having a family, becoming successful, a political goal, do you not think almost every person mindlessly follows something?

No, not *mindlessly*. Not unquestioningly. They aren't going to continue to ascribe in the face of new facts of circumstances. The point is the mindlessness here. Religions do not allow for change or evolution. They also do not allow for questions. Are you really so blind that you think having a personal goal that you are interested in, that you have considered and may change at any point, is the same as having faith in a deity?

>True, here in Germany we have to fight against the state imposing LGBT and leftist dogma.

No, you don't. No one is forcing people to be LGBT. People are being given the right to choose what they want to do, to have fewer rules, not more. Imposing a religion on people is not the same as allowing them more freedom of choice. It's not two sides of a fight. It's freedom versus having someone else's will imposed. LGBT rights do not impose on anyone, they simply remove barriers. When you say that the state ""imposes"" LGBT or anything ""left"" what you mean if the state is preventing you from imposing rules on others. You aren't being made to do anything. You aren't being restricted. Your churches aren't being closed, your religious marriages aren't being illegitimised, you aren't prevented from participating in anything because of your beliefs. You are just being presented from restricting others. The fact that you equate the two is disturbing. 

>aren't atheist or anti-theist, they are agnostic, they simply don't care.

Athiesm means no god. It is the literal definition of not caring about our believing in a deity. Saying most people in Europe don't care is true, because most people are athiests, hence they don't believe in or care about gods or religions. You seem to have built atheism up in your head as some kind of alternative religion, with tenats and dogmatic followers. We are just people who do not believe in your or any other god, and mostly we don't want your rules and beliefs limiting our freedoms."
