1,"I ""seen"" the light!ü§™"
2,"> I seen miracles happen in the name of Jesus don't .

Who is this Jesus don't fellow they speak of?"
3,"Ex-christians: LEAVE US ALONE

christians: They need my help.

Savior complex at the finest."
4,If it's all part of god's plan then I guess satan must be working for god
5,"Ah yes, Christian American Vernacular English, or C.A.V.E. speak"
6,"No need to be reborn again. I was a Christian once and the Bible only says I hafta accept Jesus to BECOME a christian - it doesn‚Äôt say I have to accept him forever. Aka if I die and god is real, I‚Äôm still going to heaven. There are very few ways (I mean like 2-3) to get your name removed from ‚Äúthe book of life‚Äù and denying god isn‚Äôt one of them."
7,Why can't these people ever type a coherent sentence? Is it a requirement for being a weirdo online evangelist that you can't have a basic grasp on punctuation and word order?
8,"""I'm here for you"" wtf do you mean?"
9,"Better to believe in him than not..

Pascals wager- Heard it so many times 

I Literally copy paste this answer from Quora each time

Pascal's wager fails to prove Yahweh, or disprove Thor, Posiedon, Ra or any one of millions of equally implausible god claims.  Everything below is my own  opinion.

This argument can't prove your god or disprove others.  The argument is well it's better to believe in my god because why take the risk of being a non believer?

The other question I pose is what risk? That your  god will strike me down or personally seek me out to convince me?   Yes I'm very sure converting one person is worth an all knowing, all powerful beings time . Which is supposedly infinite anyway /S

I really hate this argument."
10,"‚Äúit‚Äôs always better to believe in him then not‚Äù

Preaching to the choir."
11,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always better to believe in him THEN to not‚Äù. I‚Äôm so confused. I thought this was what you were trying to advise against.
12,Average cultists.
13,"So, How do they know that they aren't the ones Being deluded by satan?"
14,Christians really have no respect or even acknowledge the concept of consent. People told them to leave us alone and they keep pushing their disgusting ideology of hate and abuse. The only consolation is they publicly show how immoral their ideology so people can continue to leave in droves.
15,Tf are the mods doing? Ban that prick.
16,"Instead of spreading worthless messages, dude needs to focus on basic spelling and grammar."
17,I hate it when Satan de-lutes me. I really liked my lute.
18,Downvote to obscurity and move on
19,I got banned from it for responding to his bullshit. Like dude if you want to promote Christianity go to that forum.

22,Changing your whole life for the worse out of fear is a shitty way to live. But it's why it took me so long to leave the cult after I stopped believing
