1,"But to the religious eyes, he's a Martyr."
2,"For anyone curious about how he’s “risking the Natives’ lives,” the Sentilese have been on the island for so long, they have not been exposed to the same diseases and viruses as European and Asian civilizations. As a result, their immune systems are unprepared to fight off the germs and bacteria that we carry around on a daily basis, so him being there could have spread a massive plague amongst the population"
3,Did he know nothing about history? He could’ve wiped out the whole tribe with diseases they’re immune system isn’t familiar with
4,"Missionaries when they haven't tried to convert indigenous/isolated tribes for five minutes:  
*SpongeBob and Patrick struggling not to sing the Goofy Goober song at the tough men's bar*"
5,"Some days, I wish that more indigenous peoples had the foresight to throw the missionaries out of their lands."
6,"Missionaries going to convert native populations is probably the worst thing religion has ever come up with. It's just deliberately interfering with native people to destroy their rich historic culture in order to replace it with your own bullshit ideology. It's just imperialism with extra steps!

Fuck this guy in particular though because this was his second attempt, and because this is one of the last remaining examples of truly isolated uncontacted peoples in voluntary isolation. The sentinalese people have spent probably thousands of years making it very fucking clear that they do not want anything to do with the rest of the world."
7,What is unknown is the biological impack his corpse had on the illanders. They didnt know to not handle him for fear of disease but did they contract anything by messing with his corpse.
8,"This explains one of my arguments against religion. The fact that it needs to be taught/passed down. Say Christianity is the correct religion, how the fuck are these people supposed to know about it? Shouldn’t something as important as the correct religion be something you can independently identify and begin to follow?"
9,Two words: DARWIN AWARD.
10,"The most selfish people in the world, evangelicals. Brainwashed and completely unaware. Scary combo."
11,r/justiceserved
12,"This Frickin’ gawd-doink went to the island *three times* in the span of a few days. His third trip came *after* one of the Sentinelese planted an arrow in his Bible as a warning.

Authorities made a couple moves to try and get to the island after they found out what happened (gawd-doink chartered a local boat/crew to take him, but the crew knew it was illegal to go but they did anyway). But after the attempt by authorities to retrieve the carcass, even the gawd-doinks’ *own family* wanted the authorities to leave the Sentilelese alone because gawd-doink was batshit for a few years already by then.

Doink went from “Faith over fear” to “death over here” at light speed. 

It was, strangely enough, an ungodly amount of hubris, recklessness and stupidity all stuffed into a kayak."
13,I don't think he knew about using guns to convert natives.
14,Good riddance
15,He fucked around and found out.

17,"I'm glad this story had the proper ending. 
May any sequels end the same way."
18,How many times do you think the natives said “no” that he ignored?
19,"This story crops up regularly. When it does it consistently serves as a wonderful microcosm of Christian hubris and evil throughout history. Everywhere they go, forced conversion and either cultural or actual genocide. Or sadly sometimes both."
20,"Thankfully, his parents understood that his body would never be recovered, and didn't push for it either, understanding it would be a risk to the Sentinelese and everyone else involved."
21,Things like this make me feel these self isolated people are real bros.
22,I listened to an episode of Casefile on this guy. Dude was obsessed with indigenous and isolated tribes. He made it his life’s mission to get there. Absolutely crazy.
23,Must've been god's plan.
24,I love this story. It’s a shame that didn’t happen in 1492.
25,I wonder if there’s a way to vaccinate them? Probably just easier to leave them alone tbh.
26,Based Sentineleses
27,This should be considered a crime. Religious indoctrination is abhorrent
28,🤨📸
29,Have enough faith to believe that God has got them covered.
30,"He hardly made it off the boat before they did him in, iirc."
31,"There is a great Casefile episode with some background
https://casefilepodcast.com/case-208-john-chau/"
32,Looks like they wanted to show him god too
33,What a xenophobe group of people. Imagine getting killed for visiting a place? Are we rooting for these primitives?
34,"Christian missionaries on their way to introduce Jesus to a tribe who survived without Jesus for 60,000 years"
35,To everyone else he's a bellend!
36,"To the islanders, he was dinner."
37,"I think he looks more like a pincushion right now, if that plane is anything to go by."
38,">they have not been exposed to the same diseases and viruses as European and Asian civilizations. As a result, their immune systems are unprepared to fight off the germs and bacteria that we carry around on a daily basis

Oh god, it would be like the native americans all over again. Only this time they will probably go extinct."
39,"Apparently they’re immune systems aren’t prepared to fight, but they certainly are. Isn’t that right Mr. Chau???"
40,Well if they die it must be God's plan.😅
41,"I wonder if there's a chance - however slight - that the Sentilese have some holdover disease from prehistory, which we have no immunity to.

Maybe it would deter idiots like Chau?"
42,Watch Medicine Man from 1992.
43,He did kinda know the possibility. Apparently he did get a bunch of vaccines to try to protect them. But I think a scientist said that that still wouldn’t have really helped them. But he did kinda try. Still shouldn’t have gone at all tho
44,more like spongebob visiting sandy in her dome without water
45,Some of them did. Is just that they lost
46,They tried. All of them tried.
47,"> ""*Missionaries going to convert native populations is probably the worst thing religion has ever come up with.

I used to blame the christians, seeing the imperialism as something that goes against the teachings of Jesus, but now I understand that it's not just the christian people, but the religion itself, that promotes imperialism.                


In the gospel of Mark 16:15-16, Jesus said to preach the gospel to the world and whoever doesn't believe will be damned. In the gospel of Matthew 28:18-19, he said that all power in heaven and earth has been given to him so go baptize and make disciples of all the nations."
48,He died on his third attempt I believe
49,How did he plan on communicating with them anyways?
50,"What if their culture was sexist, homophobic, misogynist, Transphobic, Xenophobic, And all the other bad stuff? Why you criticize Christianity, Islam and other ideologies for these reasons yet celebrate a primitive culture who is even more intolerant?"
51,"I'm curious about this, too. Haven't heard any news about the island recently."
52,"Hopefully, they burned it."
53,"The living are far more dangerous then the dead... though the bacteria and viruses in his body could have caused issues, especially if they ate him."
54,"In the gospel of Matthew 28:18-19, Jesus said that all power in heaven and earth has been given to him so go baptize and make disciples of all the nations.                     


Christians feel entitled to destroy cultures and force their religion on others, because they get resources and political advantages by promoting conservative christianity, which they can see as their god blessing them for spreading the gospel, and the bible justifies it by saying that the world belongs to Jesus anyway, and to turn all nations into disciples."
55,"If he wanted to do it more successfully in the ""christian"" way, first he would've had to be fake and pretend to be their friends and learn their language, then after that, he could have shown his true colors and force christianity on them and destroy their way of life and maybe even ban their language.                   


Once they were brainwashed, he could have pretended that he brought them ""*freedom*"" and that their older pagan beliefs were horrible because they killed people, as if christians haven't been killing huge amounts of people through many generations."
56,Indian army would have taught him the appropriate lesson if he tried going that far
57,"Actually, the first settlement Columbus left in the Americas, La Navidad, did get wiped out, most likely because of sailors raping native women. Thing is, where as most people now responded to what happened by thinking the guy was crazy, Columbus and the Spaniards responded with wholesale slaughter."
58,Even vaccinating them could be dangerous...
59,Leave them tf alone!
60,"No, he made it off the boat on two occasions, both times they chased him off.

It was the third occasion where he hardly made it off the boat before they did him in. I guess they were tired of his shit and he clearly wasn't getting the hint."
61,">Are we rooting for these primitives?

Yes.

If someone showed up at my house, yelling at me in a foreign language and waving around a weapon, I'd be totally in the right to aim a gun at them and tell them to leave. If they kept showing up at my house and ran towards me, I'd be totally justified in shooting them.

Edit: And holy crap, how did I miss this:

>What a xenophobe group

>Are we rooting for these primitives?

Wow, you wanna see a xenophobe, dude? Look in the mirror..."
62,"You use xenophobic and then call a group of people that are content with their way of life primitives.

I don't think those words mean what you think they mean."
63,They have a long history of outsiders showing up and murdering them.
64,"I think I've heard of that tribe before. If I understand correctly, even something like the cold or the flu can kill those type of people, because they've been separate from humanity and don't have immunity against a lot of things, and it was illegal for him to trespass and go there anyway."
65,You are the truly are the biggest brain
66,"> What a xenophobe group of people.

I wonder why, when their experience with outsiders mirrors pretty much every native or indigenous population ever? You know: harm. 

> Imagine getting killed for visiting a place?

Imagine breaking the law to get to a place multiple people have warned you is dangerous because of how the native population will react.

Then imagine ignoring the warning shots from the native population themselves till they eventually stopped firing warning shots.

>  Are we rooting for these primitives?

Over the idiot who could have wiped them out with a disease because he wanted to force his religion on them?

Absolutely we're rooting for them."
67,Religious people dont really understand irony.
68,"To them that's 60,000 years (minus the part about the Earth not being that old) of tribespeople going to hell because no one told them the name of their sky god.

The worst part is nearly every tribe of people in history has believed in some god or supernatural being(s) with just slightly different names and forms. But yeah he was trying to save them all from hell. People who literally have never even been told about Jesus. But straight to hell anyway.

/s for the dense"
69,This flat earth is only 2022 years old tho... /s
70,They did that last time and got half of the tribe  wiped out
71,"But the world is only 6,000 years old, how can that be?  Lol!"
72,"And died right away, epic fail"
73,"To be fair, they won't be surviving for too much longer"
74,There's only about 200 of them so it wouldn't take much
75,"And don’t forget, the Native Americans introduced new diseases to the Europeans, like the syph."
76,He went multiple times too knowing he’d probably die. He went the first time and never made it to the island before they started shooting arrows. Second time he tried to talk to them by mimicking their speech and they laughed then he tried reading the Bible until a kid shot his Bible with an arrow. Third time he was killed and they buried him somewhere on the beach. He had a journal and wrote a lot about how he figured he’d probably die
77,"Did kinda try is even worse; understanding you're a biological disaster, but choosing god is more important anyways."
78,Unfortunately.
79,Wait so you are pre-supposing that the tribe is as bad as Christianity? *That's* your argument for... spreading Christianity? What in the actual mental gymnastics fuck is that line of reasoning?
80,"We don't know what they believe, and frankly, I don't give a damn. They want to be left alone, they need to be left alone. The Indian government mandates that they be left alone. The rest of the world needs to leave them alone. That's all there is to it."
81,"a) We don't know that it is any of those things, it's equally likely to be none of those things.

b) It's not the responsibility of anyone other than the Sentinalese people themselves to improve their own society. Anything else would be imperialism."
82,">What if their culture was sexist, homophobic, misogynist, Transphobic, Xenophobic,

What if their culture is egalitarian, tolerant, and harmonious? You and I have no way of knowing, and can only speculate, yet you assume the worst to defend this moron who got himself killed.

The religions you mentioned are primitive and back-asswards beyond compare, and nowhere near good enough to justify destroying an unknown culture."
83,"No one is celebrating their culture, because no one knows what their culture is.

People are respecting their desire, and right, to be left in peace. ""What if they're bad"" is not a compelling argument to justify inflicting the sort of harm on them those religions you listed have been doing to native populations around the world for generations."
84,As we shouldnt
85,"They didnt eat him, they saw where they buried him. But a body that had a flu virus still has the virus on it right after death. If they arrowed him them immediately touched his fluy body they can still contract. Especially with 0 immunities."
86,"Oh yeah, they’re basically auto immune due to isolation"
87,"Yeah, better idea"
88,Ya. That’s what I was getting at.
89,Yes that is correct. According to the government of India. The territory rightfully belongs to the sentinalese and the government cannot be held responsible for any harm caused by trespassing.
90,"I’m not sure if this is true or not, but I may or may not remember being told that certain Christians believe that those who have not been told about god or Jesus will not go to hell… if that is the case, why spread information about it?

Also, someone plzz lmk if I’m wrong."
91,"Most Christian religions believe that if you've never heard of Jesus (hench ""rejecting Jesus is impossible) you won't go to hell when you die. (Roman Catholics, Mormons, Many Baptists, etc) so this guy wasn't ""saving"" anyone.  He was guaranteeing many of them an eternity in hell"
92,"60,000 years.  I dont think those religious guys agree the earth is that old."
93,"Exactly, extinction. Common cold can wipe them the fuck out ffs"
94,Some people really are just out of their minds.
95,"Kinda crazy that despite no contact, they have similar customs like burying the dead."
96,Yup
97,"I would assume it's their argument to not cast them as ""noble savages"" - I'm in favor of leaving them alone, but not because I assume their culture is automatically worth saving but because I'm against indoctrinating them into some other belief or culture by force."
98,Well stated.
99,True.
100,"Yeah, I hope their okay..."
