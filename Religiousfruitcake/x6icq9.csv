1,Wait. I thought the atheist pedophilic libs are indoctrinating our kids?
2,"Although I agree that this is ridiculous… it’s also one *more* reason why I will never send my child to a religious school.

This happened at a parochial school, not a public school.

Please vote to support public education, teacher salaries, and a curriculum designed by education professionals instead of batshit Maga Q fundamentalist nut jobs."
3,"Don't worry, they probably fumbled the magic incantation so it's not binding. It's also unclear how they processed 100 kids, did they have a few lanes going at once in a pool or something? The bible is also rather vague when it comes to guidance on allowable pH levels for optimal baptismal performance. Does anything under a pH of 7 or above a pH of 8 prevent the magic from working?"
4,"Funny. I’ve always heard that it was the libs, gays, trans, or whatever else was grooming our kids and making them join their side. Looks like some Grade A projection there. But hey. I guess they have to usher in their NWO somehow."
5,"Just out of curiosity, was it a public school or a private one?"
6,This was a private Christian school. These sorts of headlines/tweets are deceptive. It happened during “Spiritual Emphasis Week” at a school run by a Pentecostal Holiness Church not Homecoming Week at Johnson Junior High. Do people not know what Pentecostal churches are?!?!?
7,Basically they just got a free bath. The words and meaning behind it are useless.
8,"Brooo I used to live near Fayetteville. Seems about right for the area. 

(Keep in mind, I was 7 when my family left, so if you have questions idk how well I can answer them)"
9,My crazy sister in law tried to dox my kids into getting baptized while back...
10,I’m glad it wasn’t a Jewish school.
11,Imagine the outrage if someone replaced it to Baptized to atheism
12,"Involuntary baptisms is like being bitten by a werewolf: take out the one that infected them, and they're cured."
13,even if it is real it's not the big of a deal. So what the kids had a squirt gun fight. I was baptized and it hasn't gotten in my way of worshipping satan.
14,I would sue the school. :)
15,I've seen this post under 3 different states just today lol
16,It's got 666 upvotes. You know what that means.
17,who tf cares anyway its literally just water
18,Its all projection
19,"don’t worry, this is how you sow seeds of hatred. they will only accomplish the exact opposite of their intention."
20,"Both sides are. For instance, ppl are butthurt that teachers aren't allowed to teach little kids about gay even though we really don't need to be involving them in it. and try this post for size! This is messed up! Both sides are in a power struggle on who will raise the new generation."
21,"You send them to public school to get shot, you send them to private school to get molested, or you homeschool to destroy their social development and plausibly make them hate you. I'll vote for reform every chance I get, but if I'm having children I think I have to raise them in Canada at this point."
22,"They are the party of projection.   Always yelling about the budget but don't make the people that can actually afford to pay their taxes do so,  always say they're coming after their kids but they pay for minors to get across stare lines for sex with A BANKING APP.

They are what's wrong and they don't see it that way."
23,A private school run by the Pentecostal church.
24,"

It doesn't matter.  They had no right to baptise anyone without permission.  Since the parents had not known in advance,  they were clearly not asked for permission. 

Or they would at least have provided their children with tools and clean clothes. 

Besides which,  an event like this,  where you are effectively sharing each others bath water is not only unhygienic and unhealthy,  it is sheer lunacy when there is a pandemic on."
25,Yep... Makes perfect sense.
26,So what? That doesn't make it ok.
27,"Yes, but the intent is insidious."
28,"Leaving a child in wet clothes after dunking them in water chanting who knows what isn't ""a free bath"".

Fuck any religion making kids potentially catch a cold for absolutely no observable benefits. 

Fuck any circumcision or FGM done in the modern world when its proven to not have any medical benefits(religious benefits aren't worth pain nor can children make informed consent with ideologies).

And most of all. Fuck anyone indoctrinating kids. Fuck. 
It shouldn't be this difficult to maintain morals when having a child. 
Religion needs to just die already."
29,That's an underrated comment.
30,Except this wasn’t at a public school. It was at a Pentecostal Christian school. You get what you pay for.
31,Forcing people to participate in something is a pretty obvious problem.
32,"You mean people are butthurt that teachers are
letting kids know that it’s okay for kids ti have two mom’s or two dads because that’s reality, correct?"
33,"You need to thinking long term. Canada has unfortunately been mimicking American politics and schooling is something that no one can agree on.

Mostly because the education hasn't been changed for the last several years to suit the technology available technology today and give kids an education that will allow them to be successful and because people get overly sensitive over particular subjects and history"
34,"Canada is out, they are mid-mass stabbing at the moment sadly. Also they are looking more American every day in the extremism stakes"
35,"The parents were upset because they wanted to be a part of the ceremony and one parent was scared the new baptism would cancel out a previous baptism. Whether they had “a right,” I don’t know. It was certainly inconsiderate, though. And their rights as a private school are very different than those of a public school. 

But these headlines and tweets suggest these are public schools doing these things. This is a Pentecostal school. Like the people who handle snakes in the name of Jesus and talk in tongues. The vast majority of the outrage from this tweet is completely misplaced. 

I think your odd comment about spreading Covid through shared water is the only concern that transcends all perspectives."
36,"Not saying it’s “okay” but (1) the headline/tweet is misleading, (2) parents were upset bc they weren’t a part of the ritual and wanted to be or were afraid the new baptism would cancel a previous one, and (3) what the fuck do people expect a Pentecostal school to be doing?!?!?  Seriously. Are they going to be doing sane and acceptable things?  Are they going to respect their students’ choices?  These are hard core Christians who promote division, believe diseases and disabilities can be healed through prayer and touch, and speak in tongues. A similar headline would be “Parents outraged that children at Jewish school were bar mitzvahed.”"
37,"You don’t get a cold by being wet or cold. A cold is caused by a virus. 

And these kids were attending a private school run by the Pentecostal church. They are being indoctrinated everyday. It’s literally in the curriculum. Fuck their parents for sending them there in the first place."
38,"Well, just to be the devils advocate here, there's still people out there who just believe symbolically. I don't think we should just delete religion just because. And I don't think it's feasible to do it. It will probably die out on its own once something replaces it imo.  


But yeah, these ideologies are definitely a problem. Preach something long enough and it becomes tradition and practice for no reason other than itself. Look at the US, aren't circumcisions quite prominent in the US despite it being mostly Christian? I would assume nowadays it's not quoted as a religious thing but it was first introduced as that?  


Either way, indoctrination by religion is scary and we have it super easy in the west imo. Even if your parents believe and aren't fundamentalists that will disown you for going against their word, you can still make your own mind up regarding whether you take the bullshit in or not.  


Imagine if you had to live in some random Islamic country where the consequences for going against religious ideology are much more severe. It must be hell for people of secular mindsets to live in societies where religion is permeating everything to bonkers fucking levels."
39,"the severity of what they are forced to participate in is very much a part of the equation, however. To deny this fact while dealing with christo-facsists is stupid - they don't understand nuance. Like, yes, morally, between us hippies, I agree with you."
40,No not what I meant
41,That's different
42,"Hell, I had a co-worker from India tell me about a right-wing politician that's got the country pretty upset. No place is safe. Maybe the scandinavian penninsula- I keep telling my husband to find some work there so we can maybe afford retirement."
43,"Ok so it's got no observable harm. In that case there are unobservable harms in the future which will have difficulty being solved if we latch on to ideas based on faith or belief without evidence. 

Centuries ago believing without evidence if life started at conception or birth or where in between didn't matter. But belief without evidence or faith remain the same regardless of *new* evidence which will hold the world back. 

You are also correct, fuck their parents for their decisions."
44,"Why circumcision is prevelant in USA, a quick precis (and the connection to US  FGM):
Until Victorian times, the only people in the entire world who practised circumcision were: Muslims, Jewish people; and certain isolated tribes. No one else was circumcised unless they had a rare medical condition or injury which necessitated it. In Victorian times, when disease vectors and diseases of the nervous system were not fully understood, a theory arose called the 'Reflex Neurosis theory of disease'. This held that nervous stimulus in some parts of the body caused illness in other parts. Masturbation was seen as 'dangerous', as it created the most nervous excitement. In order to prevent them masturbating, the most pleasurable parts of the genitals were delibrately damaged and / or destroyed...in both males and females by removal of the foreskin in males, and applying acid to, or surgically removing,  the external part of the clitoris and /or clitoral hood (female foreskin). Principally in the upper classes and middle classes. These were the same boys who later became doctors; inflicting the wounds of circumcision on other children (some males were castrated, and some females had their ovaries removed - voluntarily or by force- for the same reason. This was also linked to the 'eugenics' movement, and we all know where that ended up 😨). The Victorian circumcision fad originated in the British Empire in 1865, and swept the world, thanks to the vastness of the British Empire and it's power and influence at that time, although the majority, especially the poor, largely escaped it. The 'reasons' for circumcision changed as each earlier reason was debunked. In the rest of the civilised world, the genital cutting fad died out. In USA, the combination of the large number of returning Veterans from the 2nd world war who were trained as doctors under the Victorian circumcised professors; and rightly saw that circumcision was a 'nice little earner' in a crowded marketplace; together with private insurance covering the practice, meant that fewer and fewer children escaped. In fact, until the 1970s it was common for boys to be forcibly cut without the permission of the parents. Then parents started suing. Please don't let your son be a victim of the Victorian Imperial circumcision fad!  For more information please google youtube 'Elephant in the Hospital'. This book is about various strange pseudo-medical fads, including circumcision... https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I87S-xL6Q1wC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=circumcision+castration+reflex+theory+america&source=bl&ots=Za7j2YUg65&sig=gHhRj6X0KuCmZn-UriDFDiRJuYw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb8ZTd3O3TAhULLcAKHb6bA1wQ6AEIIDAH#v=onepage&q=circumcision%20castration%20reflex%20theory%20america&f=false"
45,"Symbolic reasons with an observable cold for no observable benefit to the child. Fuck that.

No ones imaginary friends get the right to dunk children in water.

God doesn't either.

It's a hope for it to be deleted, I understand feasibility and individual liberties to believe what you want.

But I give no fucks on what's feasible today. Eventually I want this shit deleted from most peoples minds(because historians and anthropologists still want it for science, otherwise ""rm -rf"" that shit).

Imagine if you had to live in some random Islamic country

Check out my comment history, we members of the r/exMuslim subreddit welcome you to learn more of our lived experiences from the ""Why we left"" megathread. 

I can't visit my dying relatives in Pakistan legally because I am an ""apostate"" for no longer believing islam. Pakistani laws state execution for me. 

It is purely barbaric due to the religion informing our laws DESPITE the progressives electing a women Prime minister before even Canada."
46,"The issue with not taking a hardline stance is that christo-fascists do not give and take, they only take, so even though it ‘could be worse’ it must be taken and responded to with high levels of seriousness."
47,Fascinating. I never know this originated during the Victorian times. What about the Jewish tradition though? I had the impression that was mostly where circumcision around the world came from.
