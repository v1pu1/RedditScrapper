1,STOP FEEDING OFF OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO JUST NEED HELP NOT YOUR FUCKING GOD
2,"Oh boy is that guy telling the truth.

My mind is always filled with questions because i study scripture in Judaism,Christianity and Islam.

Everyday I wonder how people could believe in any of this. From Judaism thinking the earth is 6000 years old and a global flood, the creator of Christianity (Paul) was clearly gay and Muhammad is clearly autistic.

The more you study this the more you see you have a bunch of nut jobs always starting religion."
3,I have lost so many friends and family to mental illness either from suicide or them losing their minds to some capacity. This is highly offensive bullshit that I'm really getting sick of hearing and reading.
4,Typical fundie. Invisible enemies everywhere
5,"I have ocd and it manifests a lot like what the OP in the post described. When I was in fundamentalist Christianity it made my OCD so much worse, and they even convinced me as a little girl that my ocd was god talking to me. I wanted to kill myself but at the same time I had a crippling fear of hell. Fuck anyone who tries to push Jesus on people with these types of mental illnesses"
6,Why don’t hear voices? Go read this book thatched convinced countless people those voices are real…
7,"Actually can someone tell me why? Most of the time i realize i am vocalizing my thoughts. The same word over and over again like a broken record...


Its so hard to get rid of this thoughts if i am anxious about something (job interview, test, phone appointments) or if i did something awkard or i said something wrong... ugh


I hate my brain sometimes."
8,"I feel ya buddy. When they prey on the vulnerable people like this, makes me want to take their bible and shove it up their ass."
9,">Christianity (Paul) was clearly gay and Muhammad is clearly autistic

I need more info or i won't be able to sleep at night."
10,"came here to say this. media says ocd is liking things neat but repetitive thoughts or nursery rhymes, songs, sayings on repeat is part of it. hope this person got help."
11,You should see a psychiatrist. It sounds like an OCD symptom but it could be something else. Best thing to do is get it checked out
12,"Definitely see a doctor and discuss your symptoms, reddit psychs won't do it. This could be echolalia or just an anxiety expression or something I'm too ignorant to see. If you can, please see it talk to a psychiatrist, they can at least give you a reason why it happens. I get this sometimes related to anxiety, but it's not very often at all."
13,"Could also be ADHD. For me it’s one to two second segments of songs (usually ones I hate) on repeat for several minutes. Whatever the case, it would be good to talk to someone who specializes in psychiatry or psychology."
14,Yep i already talked to my psychiatrist about other stuff i should explain this to her. Thanks for the advice! I hope its just my anxiety doing weird stuff.
