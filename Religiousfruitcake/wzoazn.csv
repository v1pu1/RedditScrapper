1,"Considering you can’t be a Saint until after you’re well and truly ***dead***, how would anyone have any idea if a Saint approves of Ukraine or not?"
2,Fortunately the opinions of dead men are not needed.
3,Ok but I looked in The Book of Fucks and found that there are none bequeathed by me as to what religion people are when we're discussing if it's ok to murder them.
4,And here I thought Saint Javelin had blessed Ukraine with Her Holy Firepower...
5,The Church at Kyiv was the head of the Byzantine Orthodox church after Ottomans took Constantinople.
6,"Christians are so hateful, so ugly and rotten to the core, that if you magically wave the wand and gave them their wish, a fascist government controlled by Christians, they would soon turn on themselves, and attack the milder Christians, the more reasonable Christians, the peaceful Christians. Christianity itself is corrupt. And the weirdest thing is, if I met Jesus I would actually like him. Brotherly love and kindness and charity and forgiveness, compassion, mercy all of those things are fantastic. But his followers disgust me more than  a carnival porta potty"
7,Oh so every country has to operate by outdated religious traditions that might not even be their religion?
8,St. Javelin says otherwise.
9,What are they saying? Im not well versed in christian lore
10,"Russian warship, idi nahui"
11,I mean the president’s a Jew I’m not sure sure the country exists because of orthodox beliefs
12,The first part of that is all positive. Down with orthodoxy. It literally reverses civilization
13,Left wing Marxist?  #Leninapproves
14,Orthodox Church......иди на хуй
15,Don’t you have to be dead to be declared a saint?
16,"He must believe that Putin's invasion is actually a ""defense"" of Donbas against the supposed ethnic cleansing of Russian speakers."
17,"Ah ur made up cloudnerds have not endorsed it, aww.  Shame on your cloudnerds then i suppose?"
18,"Making things up is fun, isn’t it?"
19,Paranoid brain-shit says what?
20,"I can’t really find anywhere to get a concise answer. What’s more repressive or sexist, orthodoxy or Catholicism?"
21,"Saint Helga, mother of Sveinald Helguson and wife of Ingvarr Hrøríksson probably would say it is independent."
22,"I know for a fact that Ukraine was approved for nationhood by the Council of Leprechauns, so there!"
23,Iirc there are some people who achieved sainthood while alive. But they're the vast vast vast minority
24,"As much as I love Saint Javelin, I wonder why people ignore Ukraine's actual bloodthirsty saint, St. Olga of Kyiv (https://youtu.be/v-Ymf_hTbUM)."
25,These type of orthodox seems to know so little about their own history
26,"Roughly - ""Putin good."" Just another attempt at justifying Putin's war.

Quite how Ukraine could have been created as an ""anti-Russian project"" when it's creation predates Russia is beyond me."
27,"Lviv and Chernivtsi in Western Ukraine used to have significant Jewish populations back when they were part of Austria-Hungary and later part of Poland (Lviv) and the Kingdom of Romania (Chernivtsi) after Austria-Hungary's dissolution. In the 1900s, Jews were even the most dominant ethnic group of Chernivtsi which hosted the first Yiddish Conference. And during WW2, the contemporary mayor of Chernivtsi bribed the Romanian government into sparing thousands instead of only a couple hundred of the local Jews from deportation and imminent death."

29,"There are people colloquially referred to as saints, but they’re not canonized"
30,"The formerly american protestants that ""converted"" to ortodoxism because its so based and redpilled?"
31,Interesting info but I’m not sure whether your supporting my point or not sorry if I’m being thick
32,"I have no clue what canonized means, but it sounds as if you'd be dead afterwards for sure. Non native speaker here, please be gentle.

And please don't explain it, I have no interest in religion and I want to keep the idea of it meaning being shot at by a canon."
33,"If anyone wants to know why this is the case from the catholic perspective, >!saints are defined as people we know 100% to be in heaven, instead of fucking around in purgatory like a scrub!<"
34,But you *can* be fanonized.
35,"I do not understand your perception of Orthodox Christianity. It is more centered on your continued good behavior without any sense of salvation and being ""saved"" giving you a get out if jail card. Or prosperity Jesus: not othodox.

The US would have fewer religious nut jobs spewing hate and trying to control government and.oppressing nonbelievers if there were more Orthodox.

Maybe more Jesus toast, but I am.way OK with that."
36,So you don't wish to know it is being shot BY a canon either ?
37,[deleted]
38,"It was a reference to american ""based and redpilled"" far right nutjobs adopting orthodox christianity because they think it fits their perception of the world."
39,"I might want to know THAT, you're right."
40,"Great, you ruined it :-(

Btw, shot by a canon would still be correct as there are the cameras built by the company canon.

41,"Eastern Orthodox is the Byzantine catholic church. 

RUSSIAN Orthodox is Putin religion. Not to be confused with the very established historical Eastern Orthoxy that is second only to Roman Catholocism in the number of adherents. RUSSIAN Orthodoxy is  nationalistic religion, not Orthodox, anti-Orthodox. Like N.Korea being Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

43,"Good news, by that definition there'd be billions of saints to save us."
