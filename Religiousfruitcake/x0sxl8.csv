1,"Growing up, my parents would just tape down the switch that turned the light on when the door opened so the fridge light just wouldn‚Äôt turn on. That way it was fine to open on any day.

I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre all much less religious nowadays."
2,"Wanna know an even stupider Jewish work-around for electricity on Saturday? In big cities like New York where Synagogues might be build multiple stories tall, the elevators run on ‚ÄúShabbat mode,‚Äù where instead of having to press the button to call the elevator, it just runs continuously and stops on every floor."
3,Is that the day when you're not allowed to do any work of any kind?
4,"Maybe I‚Äôm just seeing this sub more because I‚Äôve interacted with it recently, but it seems to have changed from ‚Äúmake fun of religion when it does harmful and hypocritical things‚Äù to ‚Äúmake fun of religious people for just existing and living their beliefs without bothering you.‚Äù I don‚Äôt get to decide where the sub goes but if that‚Äôs gonna be it, I‚Äôm not a fan."
5,Step 1: be les fanatical.
6,"""It's Shabbat Dude, you know I can't open my fridge."""
7,Thought this sub was about harmful practices
8,I hate these rules and having to accommodate them. These rules are baloney.
9,Lol yeah my sisters husband does that
10,"My OVEN has a sabbath mode. Seriously. Things like the light won't work, but you can bake. Is God really looking down thinking 'ah well, electricity for food, that's ok, but NO LIGHT!'?"
11,Probably faster to walk up the stairs. /s
12,"Most have multiple elevators and only one is set up like that, the others can be used by guests that dont observe shabbat."
13,Supposedly yea. Don't know how this would be work but yea.
14,Aka Saturday
15,"I'd argue that following extreme religious rules, and enforcing it on your children does a lot of harm to society. It's not just about fridge lights, which on its own is goofy and harmless, but it's far more than that. And not following those objectively silly rules in their community leads to consequences for them."
16,"I was in the idf because every Israeli does it, and I had a religious commander who was afraid to open the fridge because she didn‚Äôt know for certain if it had been set to Shabbat more before Shabbat (she got back to base about 10 minutes before Shabbat). I had actually set the fridge up for her because I knew she wasn‚Äôt going to be back in time."
17,"I definitely remember my mom refusing to cook on Shabbat when I was younger. She essentially had a Shabbat-mode hotplate she could warm things up on, but she wasn‚Äôt cooking."
18,"The argument is that turning on anything electric is equivalent to lighting a fire, which isn‚Äôt allowed on Saturday."
19,"Yeah I get it. In general I‚Äôm of the opinion that the practice of believing things without evidence is harmful in itself, even if individual beliefs might be harmless. It especially bothers me when religious people go outside their spaces to try to push their beliefs.  And I think that‚Äôs the difference I see in this post.  It‚Äôs a religious person creating content for religious people, in their own space. If I say he‚Äôs wrong to instruct other people who believe God cares what they do with their fridges on the sabbath about proper Sabbath fridge operation, I might be right. I‚Äôd also be an asshole though. Just my opinion."
20,"I was doing a modified quote from a movie called The Big Lebowski. One of the characters is a converted Jew and he constantly uses Shabbat to get out of doing things he doesn't want to do. I meant no offense, especially to the IDF. I have a great deal of respect for them and you."
21,G_d hates this one trick!
22,Interesting yet infuriating I would think
23,Thats not how fire or electricity works but ok üëç
24,Shabat in the army is really fucking hilarious actually. Some of us are secular and just don‚Äôt give a fuck and then you have the religious soldiers. So when a religious soldier has a job that requires them to use technology on Shabbat they are technically allowed to do it. That being said they are not allowed to do anything that isn‚Äôt strictly required for their job so if somebody forgets to bring them food they are SOL. A lot of religious Jews will turn off their phones before Shabbat or a holiday starts. We got a warning that somebody attempted to kidnap a soldier and steal a gun near our base so my commander texted everybody asking where we were. Two of the religious girls were actually in isolation at the time because they had been exposed to corona. So you can imagine the panic that ensued when we didn‚Äôt know where they were because my commander forgot that they were in isolation.
25,"Oh I know. Writing and drawing were also considered work by the more orthodox, which frustrated the hell out of me as a child."
26,"Oh my, I'd have been panicking too! I'd be one of those people that couldn't care less about traditions. We have Amish and Mennonites over here and they live like it's the 18th century still. In some ways it's admirable but people literally have to escape from these sects. I think it's comparable to Hasidic Judaism in some regards. It's pretty creepy."
27,"Like it makes sense these guys 2 thousand years ago made these mistakes, but when modern discoveries are made they still are making mistakes"
28,I personally don‚Äôt give a shit about religion but I was the one who pointed out to my commander that there‚Äôs no chance they are answering us by phone because they‚Äôre both religious. About five minutes into the panic I ditched kitchen duty to go knock on their barrack door (which they obviously did not open) and told them what was going on. Texted my commander and I‚Äôm like hey they‚Äôre in their barrack and they‚Äôre in quarantine.
29,Lol. My dad was super religious so that ensured I my siblings and I would hate religion for the most part. He alienated himself with his self righteous Catholic bullshit and died alone.
30,I was raised secular but my older brother became ultra orthodox. If any of my nieces or nephews ever decide they don‚Äôt want to be religious I will have an open door policy.
31,Good for you. We had nowhere to go and my dad was an abusive alcoholic. It took a lot of therapy for me to get over all of that.
32,My logic is somebody has to be that person and my parents were abusive assholes so yeah
33,"You're absolutely right. If they want out, protect them at all costs."
34,Their oldest is not quite two yet and I‚Äôm already getting her science books so that she learns about the outside world
35,Good. Don't let them poison her mind with religious bullshit. She has the potential to help humanity in a meaningful way.
36,i wanted to get her a book on evolution but I figured that‚Äôs one way to never see her again.
37,"Ya, that's too much, for now lol"
38,Instead I got her board books on organic chemistry and bacteria and antibiotics.
39,There ya go. We need organic chemists so much.
40,Oh I‚Äôm just trying to help her get a head start on the prereqs for med school
41,Can't have too many Healthcare professionals either.
