1,"Dear creationist, why don‚Äôt you use a picture of a cliff face for this meme? Oh because then it wouldn‚Äôt be obviously made by a designer, even though by your logic everything is designed‚Ä¶ See the problem
There?"
2,These people are so shockingly stupid.
3,"Oh yeah, sandcastles totally multiply over time and be different each generation...üôÑ

The analogy is utterly wrong."
4,"Theist Logic:

This sandcastle was magically poofed into existence fully formed about 6,000 years ago by an invisible, multi-dimensional Universe Creator that promises to have humanity *set on fire* forever for not participating in its blood rituals."
5,"Theist logic:

Someone made this...now if you accept that you must also accept all these very specific details about that maker, including a set of specific rules, and that the maker wants you to give me money or they will punish you."
6,"If the rest of the beech was littered with half-formed sandcastles, old photographs and paintings of the beech showed evidence that the these sandcastles have changed their form over time, a process had been discovered by which wind and waves naturally erode sand into intricate shapes and the formation of new towers, walls and turrets had been directly observed then yes, it would be perfectly reasonable to say the castles came about through erosion"
7,"What religionist say:

Q look at whatever you want (like the sand in the desert: what is the chance it would come to lie exactly like this)

A Religionists have it the wrong way around‚Ä¶. Shit happens and at the end you have a status.. if you compare that end state to all possibilities the chance of occurance is very low. 

Analogy: look at a 200,000,000 lottery winner‚Ä¶ the chance that john johnson woudl actually win the lottery is astronomically small‚Ä¶ but that does not mean that there was divine intervention to make him win‚Ä¶

Same for evolution‚Ä¶ it could have ended up in any possible way‚Ä¶this is just the one we ended up in.."
8,"Highly improbable, but not impossible. Re: Infinite monkey."
9,"I'd be tempted to explain how this is a bad analogy to them, but I know it's a waste of time."
10,"Typical theist logic, ignore all of the hard work and years of practice that enabled someone to be able to construct something like this and just attribute it to magic and mysticism instead."
11,"Oh no, my atheism is melting away!"
12,"That's funny, since pagan people did think eroded rocks were the work of gods, for exp: fairy chimneys"
13,"These people don't get it. They are constantly viewing us as separate from the universe. 

We are literally the universe manifesting itself into sentient beings. We are intrinsically bound to and utterly interconnected with the universe. We are made of the universe. (As complex organic matter)


Maybe they should look within instead of outside the universe for answers."
14,"That sandcastle, just like religion, is clearly man-made."
15,"A sandcastle is man-made. Life isn't man made. The comparison is moot. 

Check mate frootcakes"
16,"Christians love to believe humans are the be all end all of evolution, but they really aren‚Äôt.  They‚Äôre extremely fragile and don‚Äôt mesh well with any environment, on top of having a whole host of disabilities and diseases just baked into them.  If humans were created by a god, that god is a terrible craftsman"
17,I always feel this argument is kinda arrogant like we are so intricate designed that just a god like being could create us
18,Watch maker fallacy.
19,And How the universe is same as like samd castle ?
20,Christian logic: the magic man in the sky caused mass genocide with floods and sent his ‚Äòwhite‚Äô Middle Eastern son to redeem our sins.
21,"So is he saying that God made that sandcastle?  Did it ""come up"" without any human involvement?  Did this sandcastle suddenly appear after God took some time off to go to the beach?  God doesn't come to earth anymore.  He's annoyed that he banged some chick named Mary thousands of years ago and people are still talking about it."
22,"I mean if this did just magically appear, then maybe I'd put it in the evidence column for a god.

But it doesn't happen, and it never will happen.

Come at me with a good argument for once."
23,"I never understand this talking point because where did God come from, then?? They say it's silly that life evolved naturally on Earth but God just spawned out of the ether? Isn't it more ridiculous to assume an all-knowing, all-powerful being spawned from the ether without causation than it is to assume the known world around us spawned out of the ether due to reasons not yet known by observable science?"
24,Gotta love people who lack critical thinking abilities believing their arguments make any logical sense .
25,"Yeah, the grand canyon was designed. It definitely didn't get worn down over millions of years of water flow."
26,Christian logic: There‚Äôs a sky daddy who created us all
27,"Remember all those times when things happened & it was because of magic? 

Me, neither."
28,While the sandcastle couldn‚Äôt have evolved after billions of years because rocks don‚Äôt reproduce genetically - a creature with an appreciation for art and the means to create it could and did.
29,"Ah yes, the classic ‚Äúnatural order = god‚Äù argument."
30,WOAH that's a cool sandcastle.
31,"Just like God, that sand castle is man made."
32,Theists: This sandcastle is evidence that Toph Beifong is real!
33,"Because the human body is a perfect work of art, there is nothing wrong with it whatsoever‚Ä¶"
34,"That's Christian logic. 

Atheist logic is 'no somebody built this with their own fucking hands, it wasn't magically built by an invisible force'"
35,"I can't believe they're attacking a view that they have clearly completely misunderstood.

I've never heard an atheist claim that buildings randomly appeared over time. Its not been fully proven yet but I think the consensus is that buildings and probably most other highly ordered structures are usually man made."
36,"Not much of an argument when you consider what sort of natural beauty IS created through millions of years of incremental change. The Grand Canyon wasn't created with a bucket and spade.

This is just another in a long line of examples of my theory, called ""conservatives are bad at math."" A conservative once asked me how far a light year was. I responded, ""About five point eight trillion miles."" She didn't believe me.

Every once in a while I see something, some gesture or response, that indicates that conservatives are terrified of large numbers. Millions of years. Billions of kilometers. Trillions of combinations. How old is Earth? Oh, about 4.5 billion years. You see that little bit of hesitation on their faces as they're just incapable of imagining that number. For a second they're just staring into the abyss.

No problem racking up those deficits, tho..."
37,It literally did though. A human made it. This event occurred because of billions of years of evolution. Where's the lie? What's the hangup?
38,"CHRISTIAN LOGIC

this grand canyon that looks as if it took hundreds of millions of years to carve out, actually appeared instantly."
39,"Theist logic : an invisible man created everything ,needs money EVERY SUNDAY and he really really cares who you sleep with. No you cannot see him but you can read the book he definitely authored."
40,"Ah yes, evolution by erosion, my favourite theory"
41,"Well, in an infinite number of worlds..."
42,Well.. infinite monkeys and all that. Someone had to write something this dumb
43,I'd be interested to know what criteria are the most important for sand castles to survive. I suppose being able to survive waves and tides and to be able to produce little sandcastles. That being said sand castles today would suck at natural selection.
44,"I know Jesus was a carpenter, but so they also believe that every house older than themselves was built by God because they were not there to see its construction?"
45,"Creationist logic:

This useless dog turd was designed by an omniscient deity."
46,If there are infinite universes there is indeed a beach where erosion has caused this exact form to shape
47,This is just rehashing the old watchmaker fallacy
48,Theist Logic: mankind was intelligently designed and homosexyallity is wrong but God put a cum button in your butt
49,"If there was selection pressure for sandcastles, we would have natural sandcastles 10,000X more intricate than this.  They don't understand that evolution isn't random."
50,Theist logic: the grand canyon came into existence when god dragged his massive schlong over the landscape
51,"Would still like them to explain what created their God. He came from nothing, right?"
52,Theist logic: God made this just for me and I can do no wrong.
53,If sand could reproduce at the rate of a sand-grain-sized gnat then I‚Äôd totally buy that actually.
54,Whereas with religion it just popped into existence.
55,"This is nothing when I hear some bring up the ‚ÄúSo you have a brain, can you see it?‚Äù card"
56,"The correct title is ""Christian strawman"""
57,That‚Äôs an incredibly stupid straw man.
58,"That‚Äôs it boys, they got us, I‚Äôm not staying here arguing with these bastards, let‚Äôs go home!"
59,"Much like religion, this sandcastle is man-made."
60,Show them the perfect cube crystals nature forms. Bismuth with its crystalline structure.
61,"I'm not the brightest atheist, but I do feel significantly better about myself when I see shit like this."
62,Pretty funny when you realize there are actually plenty of natural rock formations that [look like castles](https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-image-castle-shaped-rock-formation-image1051626).
63,"This has changed my life, i mean its just so logical isnt it, I am now 100% religious"
64,You are not as impressive a creation as that sand castle
65,I feel stupider after reading this
66,Creationism is the Right Wing thought process at it's most blatant: a handful of variants of flippant dismissals to well established fact built around a terminal misunderstanding of what's being talked about.
67,Counterpoint; The most almighty deity of all of the universe created humans by intelligent design and ended up with this.
68,Santa Claus visits every house on Christmas night and gives out presents.  The Easter bunny gives you a basket.  And God created everything.
69,No just the sand
70,How their mind works.
71,"Can‚Äôt you just do the same to Religion?

‚ÄúTheists Logic, this sandcastle was made by the old invisible wizard man in the sky in just seconds because the people he made upset him.‚Äù"
72,"Given enough opportunity for and instances of sand formation via erosion occurring throughout time and space; this formation (as all others) would be an inevitability. 

No?"
73,"When I see a sandcastle, I know a human likely made it because I have seen humans make sandcastles. No one has ever experienced any verifiable evidence that some human-ish ghost wizard exists ‚Äúoutside of space and time‚Äù in order to command reality to exist. This argument is never comparable, ya nutty fruitcakes."
74,I would like to point out there are large rock formations which people (mainly conspiracy theorists) say where ancient cities or what ever but was actually cause be erosion
75,Theist logic:  God pushes all the water  in all the rivers and streams and in all spilled liquids downhill because divine action is the only means by which something can move.
76,"Religious logic

‚ÄúThis sandcastle came up because God willed it to, a ‚Äòman‚Äô of which i‚Äôve never met, and have no reason to believe in, willed it to happen.‚Äù"
77,There are animals that shit out of their mouth. Are they proof of god too?
78,Theist logic: The last lotto has been won therefore someone had to design that specific draw.
79,Creationists are the fucking worst
80,"Christian logic: god came out of nowhere because years of, nothing."
81,Same people: bees fly because of magic! Can I get an amen!!
82,Theists logic: This industrial complex appeared out of nowhere and produced a city's worth of  prefabricated skyscrapers out of nothing.
83,Ask them how houses were made
84,"Creationist logic: God, the single most complex entity that could exist, just poofed out of nowhere. Also, he wants to burn you forever if you don't give him money."
85,"Theist dreams: 

Atheist: ‚ÄúCool sandcastle!‚Äù 

Theist:  ‚ÄúThat proves there‚Äôs a God!‚Äù

Atheist:  ‚ÄúOooh good point. Ok NOW I believe!‚Äù 

Theist:   ‚Äúüòä See, I was right all along!‚Äù

Aetheist : ‚ÄúYes! Yes you were right.‚Äù"
86,"these people are fucking stupid, what the fuck"
87,This is probably the most stupidest thing they could have ever used as an analogy.
88,Oh shit it's Bible Flock Box. I used to watch him quite a bit when I was a sort of devout Christian and I'm glad I did because he among other things led me down to question my beliefs. Thanks Bible Flock Box
89,It's so hard to switch from downvote to upvote in this reddit üòÆ‚Äçüí®
90,Oh shit ‚Ä¶ I have to reconsider everything
91,It‚Äôs still more likely true than their gods existence.
92,I require this to be satire
93,"Given infinite time, a sandcastle identical to this will by chance be created by erosion an infinite amount of times. 

Just as given enough time, something alive will spontaneous be born from dead matter. Adding the special circumstances here on earth that time can be reduced to a few billions years. 

So this person is correct, this is atheist logic and it fucking works."
94,CHRISTIAN LOGIC: none
95,Christians ‚òï
96,"Oh okay. The sandcastle appeared there because god went 'let there be a sandcastle' and so it was.

...is that the argument here? ;)"
97,"I'm listening to a Great Courses on evolution and the lecturer notes that if a god had created everything then everything wouldn't be so slapdash. Nothing is perfect, as one would expect from a godly creation, everything is simply good enough to get by."
98,This is some of the dumbest shit I have ever saw
99,**Ever seen a coral reef?**
100,I mean it could
