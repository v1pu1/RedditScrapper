1,Showing that even the children arent even safe from their soldiers
2,“But women choose to wear the hijab! It’s not forced on them! It’s a sign of their faith!” - Every male Islamist on social media.
3,Wait... Isn't god/Allah already watching everything? What's the need for cameras? Don't they trust the god they've invented?
4,Iran is now actin' like China's social credit but hijab.
5,Won't surprise me if in about a decade the cameras are placed in homes to enforce adherence to the religion.
6,Fuck fascist.
7,"Should we program our cameras to detect fights, pickpocketing, fare dodging? Oh, women committing heresy for showing hair? Perfect, great priorities."
8,"Yeah lets just ignore all the poverty, crime and corruption in this country and obsess over women's headwear. That'll totally make this country better. /s"
9,EVEN THE FUCKING CHILDREN?!?!??
10,Such a progressive liberating religion

12,The little girl too huh
13,This is the same country where you can get a death sentence simply by being gay...
14,Top 1 most useless uses of tax money. Maybe instead of probably dropping a couple cool millions on this shit they d be better off with an infrastructure project or something to improve their sanction-buttfucked economy
15,I think it was also Iran who introduced automatic finger amputators as punishment for stealing. How modern of them...
16,believable and awful. where is this image from? Title says they're *planning* to use it - did someone just add a bunch of green boxes to a random pic as clickbait or is this a real demo? horrifying and unsurprising either way.
17,Damn I guess Allah is getting lazy lately and robots with cameras have to pick up the slack.
18,Just don’t do anything wrong and you have nothing to worry about until the lunatics take ahold of the reigns.
19,Son of a bitch cyber-muhommed?
20,"Yeah pro.mo. was the best surgeon, astronomer, writer, philosopher ever lived."
21,"What would happen if they ""catched"" a woman whose hair is showing?"
22,idk man this only happening in iran shouldn’t this hint that iran is just an extremist government and not really about religion
23,the title confuses me unless it's sarcasm. didn't he also own hundreds of women sex slaves?
24,Are those nuns?
25,"The prophet married a 6 year old 

When were children ever safe in Islam?"
26,Bold of you to assume children aren’t women in Islam
27," A lot do women say this too 

I was one of them 

I don’t know why I didn’t acknowledge that there were women who were forced into it 

I would just think it shouldn’t be forced and that those who force are being un-islamic

But that doesn’t really do much to help the women and children who are forced"
28,"That’s the case in Christian secular countries, not muslim ones. But sadly Muslims in muslim counties don’t have the louder voice"
29,Allah needs you to do its bidding because all powerful but life is a test and this is your test
30,I live in iran and heck no they do what they want idk if government even believe in god
31,He's too busy ensuring Muslim countries are the most prosperous in the world
32,He needs a break too you know. Smh 🤣
33,Don't really think the women that have the loose hijabs would care enough about allah to fix it up and the government probably knows it
34,But the men in power need an excuse to assert dominance over women
35,What?
36,Yup! Indeed he did
37,how old are you 💀
38,The best.
39,Never. Just poi ting out that its even part of the news article photo that a child is being targeted for discrimiination.
40,"Women = children (with no agency)

Women = objects (barely allowed sentience and emotions)

What else?"
41,"Hi, yeah for sure there are women that do. But every time, every time there’s a discussion about the hijab there’s a bunch of men saying the above trying to shut down any discussion and hand wave away the way women are treated if they don’t.

“and that those who force are being un-islamic” I disagree with this. It’s pretty much a No True Scotsman fallacy. A religion is what it’s followers make it, if a mob of Islamic men burn a women to death because she “insulted” Islam, you can’t hand wave that away by saying they’re “aren’t really Islamic” it’s Islamic followers doing it for their Islamic religion. You don’t get to pick and choose which groups are or aren’t Islamic at certain times based on what you decide makes Islam look bad to the rest of the world. 

And there are lines in Quran about women having to wearing it. Apostate Prophet on the Atheist Experience Podcast a few month ago did a big discussion about this."
42,"Sorry I don’t follow. Muslims in Muslim counties don’t have the louder voice? 

And secular countries, don’t need to add Christian in the front."
43,They've failed according to God's laws. Can't he shoot lightning bolts from his nostrils in a train station anymore? Why pay someone to do it?
44,"Allah needs you do watch the people who hes watching because hes also watching you to make sure you are watching the people that are to be watched. Part of your religious duty is to make sure all the people who need watching are watched, and you are being watched by Allah to make sure you watch them. And other people who are in your situation are watching you because they are watched by Allah who is watching them to ensure they are watching the you who does the watching of the people who are to be watched. 

And thats why i googled ""sexy haram butts"" today"
45,"""Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful."" — Seneca"
46,There excuse to power is god
47,Women = devils taking holy and pure men astray
48,"And to say all this covering up with Burkas hijabs niqabs etc is for protection is utter shite because they still get raped regardless because Muslim men do as they please with no consequences. They are so lacking in willpower and self control it's unreal and yet it's propagated by Imams and other leaders and I believe it's due to fear of women and an all round lack of respect

In my humble opinion of course"
49,"Well yeah I agree with you 

I’m just saying what I was thinking back when I was Muslim

Hence my tag former fruitcake"

51,"Sorry I should have specified. Muslim women in muslim countries do not have louder voices. If they try to speak up westerners will gaslight them into believing that its “just culture”, or they’ll get harassed by men (and women) or the government.

All the countries where you can actively live a normal lifestyle are Christian and secular. Western Europe and North America (until recently that is). These all follow the church, but not all Christian countries have separated the church from the law which is why i wrote “secular and Christian”"
52,"Good point. 

Woman = distraction"
53,Ah right sorry. I love your tag :) glad to see you made it out. Wishing you all the best.
54,"I’m sure there are lots of people that don’t see anything wrong with stabbing their daughter to death for dating a non-Muslim. True. 

Different is, I’m not a Muslim and I’m not trying to defend or make excuses for their actions. I’m not picking and choosing, I’m the one accepting it as part of the religion. 

We’re going to have fundamental disagreements if you think stabbing someone because they wrote a book you don’t like is _nuanced_ “picking and choosing”. There’s absolutely nothing we can discuss further if we can’t agree on a moral baseline. If you’re going to go down that argument, then you’ve disprove the reason for your own religion. 

At no point did I say _I’m_ _only_ picking the bad as a representation of Islam. I’m pointing out that people say Islamic people killing for and in the name of Islam, aren’t Islamic, is a no true Scotsman fallacy. Which it is. Pointing that out, isn’t in itself a no true Scott man’s facility."
55,"I’d be surprised if western men are telling islamic women in islamic countries, that they _should_ wear a burka because it’s their culture. The time I’ve seen this discussed is internally with other westerners, mainly against those that think the solution is a world wide enforced Anglo monoculture. There are peoples don’t have a problem with women wearing a hijab, if the woman wants to.

As my original off the cuff comment stated, the issues is when women don’t want to wear it, and the repercussions they face, and the denial of it happening by men whenever there is a discussion about the subject. Or, when backed into a corner, some, will try to shut down the discussion with “well those aren’t really Muslim laws/people/countries/whatever anyway”. Which isn’t helping those people being attacked by Islamic followers. 

Secularism is separation of religion in government and society. Saying Christian secularism doesn’t really make sense, but I see what you’re saying. But I would point out secular countries like Japan, Vietnam, South Korea. I believe Azerbaijan and Turkey is considered secular and at one point Iran was."
56,">All the countries where you can actively live a normal lifestyle are Christian and secular. Western Europe and North America (until recently that is).  

Ironically, they are part of the reason why you can't live a normal lifestyle in some non-Western countries."
57,Thanks!
58,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Turkey kinda losing its secularism thanks to Erdoğan?"
59,"Secular Christian is an oxymoron but it fits what I’m trying to say. You can wear and practice whatever you want in, let’s say, the UK. But its still a Christian country"
60,I guess you have a point if we’re talking about desi countries. But its not the west’s fault Muslims are sexist and violent
