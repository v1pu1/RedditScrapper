1,"Here‚Äôs what he said: 

Adam and Eve were not immortal as they didn‚Äôt eat from the tree of everlasting life yet.

I‚Äôm not an antitheist as I‚Äôm technically a theist. My ideas of god are just different and it‚Äôs easier for me to say I‚Äôm an atheist rather than explaining my whole thing.

‚ÄúCatch the hammer?‚Äù I‚Äôve been here for a long time. I‚Äôve been banned twice because people thought I was trolling but then they went through my history and found out I wasn‚Äôt. Trolling is just being stupid for fun and reactions. I‚Äôm here to share ideas, hear ideas, and have conversations. Because I‚Äôm respectful and honest with my interactions. You‚Äôre upset and that‚Äôs okay. I understand that you have your guard up whenever you see the word ‚Äúatheist‚Äù. I want to get rid of stigma and hatred on both sides. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being so hostile. I‚Äôm just explaining my thinking and how I was taught in order to help you understand where I was coming from so we could have an open conversation. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre so angry.

God is supposed to be just. Justice means the punishment is equal to the crime, no more and no less. Sin is a finite crime against an infinite being that knows we will sin. It‚Äôs unjust to be sent to hell for not believing, for example, when God knows what would convince someone but refused to give them that evidence. It‚Äôs unjust to go to hell for anything as an infinite punishment for a finite crime. It‚Äôs unjust. I‚Äôm using the morals that He gave me. I‚Äôm using the mind He gave me. He wouldn‚Äôtve given us logic if he didn‚Äôt want us to use it.

Romans 1:26 is Paul cautioning against a large scale cultic practice of homosexual acts. Such an explanation fits well with the broader context of disavowing and disallowing idolatrous practices, where homosexuality was a prime component of other cultic practices including temple prostitution. This explanation ties in with the Pauline argument based on perception and ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù, where an appeal for the natural fitting together of male and female is made. cautions against a large scale cultic practice of homosexual acts.

Paul is criticising heterosexual people who engages in homosexual activities which are ‚Äúagainst their nature‚Äù, and his criticism is not directed against people who are homosexual by nature, and for whom homosexual relations and activities would be ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. Furthermore, Paul is in any case criticising ‚Äúreckless, shameless, profligate, promiscuous behaviour‚Äù, not the contemporary ‚Äúcommitted, loving homosexual relationships.‚Äù

The statements against homoeroticism are presented as part of a wider discourse on God‚Äôs reaction against human idolatry which manifests also in human lack of control over their bodies. Female homoeroticism impinges upon the honour of the husbands of these women, leaving the men emasculated. ‚ÄúBecause they do not worship God, this is the shameful state to which God has reduced them. The message in Romans is not about morality but about faith, about the difference between life in Christ and life without, in Israel redeemed and outside Israel‚Äù. Moreover, and although a typical Jewish concern with a generalised sense of the Gentile life, contemporary philosophers and the Stoics in particular emphasised the need for self-mastery and deplored the lack of self-mastery as foolishness ‚Äì a similar stance as found in Romans 1:21-28.

I‚Äôm bi. I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôve found happy and healthy relationships. The reason they‚Äôve ended was due to pressure from the outside who thought we were disgusting, harmful, and don‚Äôt deserve to live.

Not talking about prostitution? Hm. Well, in the surrounding cultures, the major socially acceptable form of same-sex activity was with male shrine prostitutes as part of temple worship to pagan gods and goddesses. And there is repeated rhetoric against these shrine prostitutes at different parts of the Hebrew Bible [see Deut. 23:17; 1 Kings 14:24 (linked with abomination), 15:12, 22:46, 23:7].

Looking wider afield, there were cultures like Ancient Greece, where the dominant form of male-male intercourse was (usually married) men with boys ‚Äì pederasty. And did you notice that the verses said a man lying with a male, not a man lying with a man?

Now, occasionally I‚Äôve seen some commentators claim that this is trying to link it back to Genesis (male and female he created them), but if so it is rather strange that ‚Äòfemale isn‚Äôt used‚Äô; it‚Äôs ‚Äòas with a woman‚Äô and not ‚Äòfemale‚Äô.

I think it more likely that ‚Äòmale‚Äô is used here precisely because it can include lying with boys as well as men.

So two main contexts for the Israelite people to be different from ‚Äì male-male intercourse linked with pagan temple goddess worship, and pederasty.

Note how different these are from what we are looking at today; with faithful, loving, committed relationships."
2,"the bible‚Äôs viewpoint has never changed!!!

alright, then christians still support slavery? good to know üëç"
3,So is it the Church or the Bible that is ultimately the arbiter of god's word? You'd think that would be less confusing
4,"No that is not remotely what I said. You claimed they posted a long argument for why the Bible isn‚Äôt homophobic, and it is."
5,"Oh, hey, I recognize that profile picture! I got in a pretty nasty argument with him myself a few months ago‚Ä¶"
6,Two brick walls rarely move one another.
7,"So funny. When Constantine decided that he wanted to use Chriatians as a power source, he decided, with the semi advice of the council of Nicea, which he sort of rejected what sacred Christian texts were holy. So then he and the Bishop of Alexandria essentially created the Bible as we know it. He threw so many sacred texts out that he required all priests and above  to send all their holy texts to Rome, and he would send you your new beliefs.

The Donats decided they would not. The Northwrn African clerics were.deemed heretics by Constantines new sect.  For the crime of  keeping the faith as passed down from the actual time ofJesus and.Donatism was oppressed. Look up Christian apocrypha, Gospel of Mary, etc.

So, anybody who thinks Christianity is what is in the Bible, and has always been, needs to talk to the Donats, and maybe the Ethiopian Christians"
8," A few things. It bothers me how he says Biblical answer then says ‚ÄúHoly Tradition and Doctrine‚Äù these arnt Biblical and directly contradict Biblical things. It directly contradicts Jesus.


His Church was not the first person to canonize the Bible. Marcion was the first one to do that

Sodomy could be used for a few things. Such as anal sex and blowjobs.

The Catholic Church as it is today has not existed for 2000 years.

Homosexuality is a very  interesting thing in scripture. What people need to understand is that laws in the Bible were created to combat something that is happening around them. The reasons the OT talks about homosexuality is because the Jews who wrote that were in an Area where people would have sex with younger men or friends for fun. These laws come from a time where people were somewhat ignorant to homosexuality as 2 people being in love with each other. Those laws arnt coming about because they see 2 men with each other. They are created because they see soldiers  and Greeks? Having sex for fun. What‚Äôs interesting here is that the men having sex are not homosexual but heterosexual.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find a single heterosexual man that wouldn‚Äôt have sex with another man if they were pretty or something and there were no woman around.

Paul has this same way of thinking when you read his writings. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care or know about to men loving each other. I personally think Paul was a closeted gay man but that‚Äôs another conversation. Paul focuses a lot on men kind of like Jesse Lee Peterson. We know he‚Äôs gay even though he launches attacks on gay men. 

Paul may say some things about homosexuality but he is referring more to male prostitution then 2 men in love with each other. AT the same time Paul also says not to have sex in general because he thought the end of the world was soon and with in his lifetime. Paul actually had to say it a letter that ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. If your going to have sex you might as well get married‚Äù BUT Paul at first thought people shouldn‚Äôt have sex at all but had to change his stance because people pushed back.


The fact that this guy says the church never change shows he‚Äôs never taken the time to learn his churches history."
9,"Well, Leviticus is pretty cut and dry as homophobic as it gets, it‚Äôs one of the many reasons the Bible is trash and I can‚Äôt condone the revisionist gymnastics to try and cover that up even if their heart is in the right place."
10,"I understand this argument but I never find it convincing, even when I was an Evangelical. This line of thinking, as seen in the post, would fare even worse with conservative Christians with stronger emphasis on Apostolic tradition, like Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. 

If you look at the punishment prescribed for this act of ""lying with a male as with a woman"", it is death for both parties.

So if this verse is indeed talking about pederasty, which necessarily involves a power imbalance, the punishment is very unjust with regards to the minor in the relationship. If pederasty was indeed baked into the culture of the time, and which Leviticus was trying to condemn, these younger boys/males likely didn't have much to say regarding the practice itself. They were more likely to be a victim, in our current understanding of morality. On the other hand, if the verse is understood as two men consenting to commit homosexual acts with each other, the punishment would have made more sense, and just, in that context.

Early church fathers, both Latin and Greek, have always condemned homosexual acts. John Chrysostom, the foremost authority in the Orthodox church, condemned homosexuality. So it would be next to impossible to convince a practising Orthodox Christian that being gay is okay. One Latin father - his name eludes me now - used the example of Jupiter's relationship with the boy Ganymede as proof of him being a false god (or demon in disguise). A true God would have never approved, let alone engaged, in the practice of sodomy. And his argument places a heavy emphasis on the gender of Ganymede, not his age. So, this is a general condemnation against homosexuality, not merely pederasty.

It all comes down to one's understanding of the continuity vs discontinuity in church teachings. Which part can change vs which part can't change. Or put differently, what the nature of ""progressive revelation"" is. 

What some view as ""brick wall"", some others view as ""protective wall"".
What some view as ""progress"", some others view as ""degeneracy"".

For the record, I'm gay and grew up an Evangelical. However, I'm still conflicted whether I can stay Christian or not whilst accepting my gayness since I'm more convinced by the so-called argument via tradition than by the Evangelical attempts at proof-texting."
11,And that's why religions desperately need to swallow their pride and *update themselves*.
12,"Different Christians answer this differently.

For an Orthodox Christian (and Roman Catholics), it is the bible, as interpreted through the teachings of the apostles and church fathers, which came to them via tradition.

Only the Evangelicals and modern Protestants believe in the individual interpretation of the bible. Even John Calvin quoted the opinions of church fathers in trying to support his arguments.

So, the person in the OP is actually acting consistently with his tradition."
13,Two nuts in the same slice of fruitcake.
14,The Council of Nicaea was about Jesus‚Äôs divinity. Had nothing to do with scripture. The council had nothing to do with the creation of the Bible.
15,"Why do you think that the existence of tradition contradicts Jesus? These Christians would refer to the Great Commission where Jesus said that the apostles are to teach the ones they baptise to do whatever Jesus taught them to do. They are also asked to commemorate his death ""until he comes again."" The Orthodox interpets this as their Divine Liturgy, the Catholics as their Eucharist, and the Protestants as their communion. Wasn't Jesus laying down a form of tradition in both of these cases?

The guy is Eastern Orthodox though, not Catholic. He would likely think that Catholics are heretics. His chuch, like the RCC, would likely condemn anal and oral sex too. If I'm not wrong, one Orthodox saint opined that the reason a boy would show homosexual tendencies is because his mother engages in anal sex while she is pregnant.

And with regards to Eastern Orthodoxy never changing, we have this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Believers.
I have no knowledge whatsoever about Eastern Orthodoxy though. 
I also noticed that since Reddit is heavily US-based, the arguments people field against Christianity focus on Evangelicalism, and to a lesser extent Roman Catholicism. These sorts of arguments would never win the Eastern Orthodox. Unless one attacks the veracity of the Bible itself."
16,"Leviticus are laws only for the Jewish people.

If a Christian uses it, they are taking scripture out of context"
17,So you admit you didn‚Äôt read anything?
18,"It forbids men to ""lie with a man as thou would with a woman"". Like, what, in the missionary position? How would two men even *do* that without crushing each other's nuts?"
19,Funny.
20,"I was Orthodox, but every Sunday we read the Nicean Creed, something definitely not original in Christianity."
21,"Which verse was it that god said ‚Äúignore everything I said in the Old Testament it was just a meme‚Äù? Is it when Jesus said 

>	‚Äú**Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets**; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished‚Äù (Matthew 5:17‚Äì18).

You really think Christian‚Äôs are supposed to just ignore the part where the perfect god they worship tells them that two men having sex is an abomination and they need to be executed?"
22,"I mean I feel like it‚Äôs not that far fetched that guys could have sex in a way similar to missionary but without going into graphic detail lol, the way the Bible typically uses the word ‚Äúlie‚Äù is a general term for sex. I mean it‚Äôs essentially just saying man should not simulate the kinds of acts they do with a woman, with another man."
23,The more you know
24,"Some Christians would say that this is part of ""progressive revelation"" - I don't know if the Orthodox has an equivalent concept.
Basically God revealing his truth in step-wise manner without contradicting his previous revelation. They would use this to counter the objection to certain new concepts appearing as doctrines.

Some Protestant theologians would claim that OT figures obtained redemption before Jesus by trusting in the advent of the future promise (a concept found in the letter to the Hebrews).
One of my Calvinist pastors believed that the OT God was ""as-yet-unclear Trinity"". 

Of course, whether these are all valid arguments is another can of worms. Jewish rabbis would definitely disagree with the Christians' conclusions, of course.

As an aside, my home church (Protestant) would make the congregants recite the Nicene creed on important days, like Christmas and Easter, instead of the abridged form (called the Apostles' creed) they routinely use in ordinary services. 
But of course, their version has the ""filioque"" clause in it."
25,"Jesus was a Jew talking to other Jews not Christians. A lot of people think Jesus was a Christian preaching to Christians when he wasn‚Äôt. You also have in scripture Jesus saying and showing that he only came for the Jewish people.

That doesn‚Äôt change that the OT was meant for only the Jewish people. That‚Äôs when Paul comes along and changes thing. 

Leviticus and Deuteronomy were for a certain sect of Judaism and not every Jew followed them.

There are different kinds of Judaism and you shouldn‚Äôt look at the OT as if every Jew followed it.  Leviticus was made for a certain sect of Jews in a certain area. Jews in other areas didn‚Äôt follow it and the same goes for Deuteronomy. It wasnt till much later things were combined and even then many Jews went their own ways.

For example. Jesus‚Äôs Judaism is different the Philo of Alexandria‚Äôs Judaism and they existed during the same time period

I will also add when Jesus says he hasn‚Äôt come to abolish the law he saying he hasn‚Äôt come to abolish the Torah. He came to fulfill the Torah. 

There are 2 Jesus‚Äôs here. The historical one that clearly only cares for the Jewish people and the theological one that Christians have created."
26,One of us does.
27,"Ok cool so Christians should just ignore everything in the Bible then because Jesus wasn‚Äôt talking to them, I‚Äôll be the first to let them know. 

You‚Äôre gonna have to find me the verse where Jesus says ‚Äúonly Jews should believe what I‚Äôm
Saying‚Äù because I can‚Äôt remember one. The problem is that, even if you can find that verse, none of these arguments are relevant. It doesn‚Äôt actually matter *who* Jesus was talking to, because Christians follow his words regardless and believe in his teachings, and because that‚Äôs **not even the topic.** It‚Äôs complete non sequitur.

Most importantly, It doesn‚Äôt matter who anyone was talking to because the claim I‚Äôm disputing is whether or not the Bible is homophobic, not who Jesus is talking to. This is a very simple logical syllogism.

P1: If a book condones homophobic actions then that book is homophobic   
P2: The Bible condones homophobic actions  
Conclusion: The Bible is homophobic"
28,And that would be me.
29,"I don‚Äôt know how else to tell you Jesus was a Jew preaching Jewish things to only the Jewish people.

The Torah is only meant for the Jews and no one else. The commandments are meant for the Jews and no one else.  The Jewish people did not expect outsiders to follow the Torah the way Christians think everyone should be following the Bible.

I can‚Äôt stress this enough. You need to separate the historical Jesus, the Jesus in scripture and the Jesus Christian‚Äôs have created.

Christians do not follow Jesus‚Äôs words.

The Bible is criticizing heterosexual men that sleep with other men. Not homosexual love because the authors did not know how the brain worked and it was heterosexual men that were going around sleeping with each other. 

Do you want the verse where Yahweh was given to the Israelites? Do you want the verse where the gentile woman had to beg Jesus to help her?"
30,Believers are not knowers.
31,"I can‚Äôt stress enough it doesn‚Äôt make a single difference who Jesus was talking to. I don‚Äôt even have to disagree with that point for the Bible to still be homophobic. As I already said this is a complete non sequitur. 

If I write a book speaking only to Irish people, and it tells them they need to go kill all Asian people because they‚Äôre an abomination, does that mean it‚Äôs not a racist book just because I‚Äôm only talking to the Irish? Of course not, such an argument is completely nonsensical.

Additionally, I  gave a logical syllogism of exactly my argument proving the Bible is homophobic and you left that totally unchallenged.


Edit: I forgot to address this one 

>	The Bible is criticizing heterosexual men that sleep with other men. Not homosexual love 

Really? How many Olympic Gold medals do you have?"
32,"I‚Äôm an atheist that studies Judaism and Christianity.

The council of Nicaea was not about scripture but about Jesus‚Äôs divinity. There was a person going around gaining a following and it had to be addressed. The dudes name was Arius. 

This is when the doctrine of the Trinity came about as well even though it was coined and called heretical 200 years before.

What your doing is saying something and showing your ignorance. Be happy you learned something you were wrong about. Knowledge is great"
33,"It does matter who Jesus was talking to and the context of what is being said.

I never said the Bible wasn‚Äôt homophobic. I just said that they look at homosexuality in a different way because they arnt talking about homosexuals. But straight men sleeping with other straight men for fun. 

Get it?"
34,"Well, I'll take my good college grades in the BIble and fathers 50 years as a Biblical scholar and writer and say the 1st Council of Nicea removed many many sacred texts from study because it didn't fit Constantines needs, and rhat is how the Bible was formed. By making heretic the believers in these long held natures of Jesus and.god. you almost have it, but miss the consequences.

You completely ignore  the fallout between deciding that ""nature of Jesus and trinity and the end of much sacred texts. 
And then Constantines church required the priests and others return their holy books to th, so they could recieve the revised Christian belief books.which set up the church of Carthage issues with Donatism. 

Read the apocryphal, that which was made heretical. And how about Constantine and the Bishop of Constantinople? How do you explain that away??"
35,">	It does matter who Jesus was talking to and the context of what is being said.

No it doesn‚Äôt matter who Jesus is talking to because again, the Bible is homophobic regardless of who he‚Äôs talking to. See my book to the Irish example above once again.

>	I never said the Bible wasn‚Äôt homophobic.

Read the title of the post above. The post that we‚Äôre having this discussion in right now is about a long post trying to argue the Bible is not homophobic. That‚Äôs the entire topic and precisely what I‚Äôm arguing against.


>	they look at homosexuality in a different way because they arnt talking about homosexuals. But straight men sleeping with other straight men for fun.

This is the only argument you‚Äôve presented thus far that actually would work *if it were true* but I have no idea why you would believe this is true. The Bible doesn‚Äôt make a distinction between heterosexual and homosexual precisely because of what you said earlier, they didn‚Äôt understand how the brain works. They didn‚Äôt have a concept of homosexuality because they just thought of it as a wicked act, an abomination. They weren‚Äôt secretly progressive and gay friendly. The reason why there are no verses talking about how God is cool with ‚Äútrue‚Äù homosexuals is because he wasn‚Äôt. You need to have Reed Richard‚Äôs arms to make this kind of reach."

61,That fact that you don‚Äôt understand what I just said says everything lol.
62,And the fact that you can‚Äôt explain it because it doesn‚Äôt make any kind logical sense whatsoever? What does that say?
63,"Alright cool. Let me explain it. Since your to lazy to listen to 100 + years of scholarship.


The Law where men shouldn‚Äôt lay down with other men is applied only to the priestly class. This is scholarship and it‚Äôs what we know of this sect of Judaism who wrote Leviticus. 

When you read that verse you shouldn‚Äôt be reading it as a law for everyone but a law for the priestly class and people more focus on spiritual things.

This law comes because the Jewish people were around Persians and Greeks. Greeks were known to sleep with younger men and their friends for fun. They did not care for purity and did not care for anything spiritual. Homosexuality existed but during that time they did not view it the way we view it today. The Jewish people saw Homosexuality as pagan worship and not love. 

So sure you can say the Bible is homophobic but your missing something extremely important when you read the Bible literally like you do. 

They are not looking at this as 2 men in love but pagan worship or pagan practices. They arnt aware of what homosexuality is because they are a  primitive people who view homosexuality as pagan. They see a bunch of pagan people doing things and they are associating it with paganism


Now, if your looking for Bible verses you arnt going to find it. 

If you want to verify what I‚Äôm saying I literally have you Academics who talk about it and scholars who study Judaism will tell you this"
64,"Yeah cool so you just did a massive gish Gallup, what a shocker. You brought out the same old tired irrelevant argument that I already debunked about ‚Äúwho‚Äù they‚Äôre talking to. It can not be made more clear that it doesn‚Äôt matter who they‚Äôre talking to. This is completely invalid logic and proves literally nothing regardless who they‚Äôre talking to. ‚ÄúWho‚Äù the law is for is not, and never has at any point been the question. 

Then you just went on to make more claims with **zero** supporting evidence. So your claim that it‚Äôs talking about straight people once again goes completely unproven. Once again, you just did an appeal to authority fallacy. I can go find some scholars that say climate change is a hoax, does that mean they‚Äôre right? **No**. 

Is there anything in the actual **Book** we‚Äôre talking about that supports your claim? Of course not. And somehow that isn‚Äôt a huge obvious flashing sign to you, that you‚Äôre completely fabricating nonsense.

>	So sure you can say the Bible is homophobic

And I would be and have been right, because you have **ZERO** supporting evidence and **ZERO** logical argument to suggest anything else.

Let me just leave you with one final question to dodge like all the others, what‚Äôs the fucking point of reading those books you cited earlier if you can‚Äôt point to a single thing in them to prove anything?"

70,"And Yahweh said to Moses, 'Say to the priests, the sons of Aaron. . .'"" In other words, this specific chapter was meant exclusively for the Aaronid priesthood, and besides, the only man that could offer bread to Yahweh was the Aaronid priest (Ex 25:30). Chapters 21-22 might have existed, like Lev 1-7, as a once independent text for the Aaronid priesthood exclusively.

More generally (excerpted from my forthcoming book on Genesis 1 and the Priestly writer):

Throughout the book of Leviticus, and especially in those chapters devoted to its laws and commandments (Lev 11-22), the role of the Aaronid priests is repeatedly defined by the phrase ""to distinguish between the holy and the profane, between the pure and the impure."" In fact, the whole priestly law code is presented as the very instruction (torah) for doing this. Its torahs are ""to distinguish between the holy and the profane, the pure and the impure"" in matters of: diet (Lev 11); women, i.e., menstruation and childbirth (Lev 12); skin diseases and afflictions (Lev 13-14); bodily emissions (Lev 15); sex and nudity (Lev 18, 20); miscellaneous matters (Lev 19); and issues concerning the Aaronid priesthood (Lev 21-22).
Thus according to the priests who composed this text, certain foods are unclean or impure; a woman's menstruation is impure; any bodily discharge or emission is impure; leprosy and other skin infections are impure; in fact diseases by their very nature are impure; any clothes or a house that comes into contact with the infectious is also unclean and impure. Anything that touches, for example, pork, a corpse, the blood of a menstruating woman---whether a bottle, a piece of clothing, a bed, the walls of your house, etc.---also becomes contaminated and impure and must be purified through washing or simply discarded. Likewise, any individual coming into physical contact with a corpse or the blood of a menstruating woman also becomes impure. Exposing the nudity of one's relative is impure; homosexuality is impure; having intercourse with a menstruating woman is unclean; mix-breeding animals and different kinds of seeds are impure; eating a torn animal is impure, and so on. Moreover, any individual who has contracted an impurity (i.e., committed a sin) and does not expiate his impurity/sin through a ritualized washing and sacrifice officiated over by the Aaronid priest was irrevocably cut off and banished from the community.
There are numerous other examples of pro-Aaronid legislation and a pro-Aaronid Yahweh that are only found in the Priestly source---all of which stand in sharp contrast to the pan-Levite legislation and pan-Levite Yahweh of Deuteronomy. Thus, in this Aaronid-written text, and only in this text, do we find ""Yahweh"" endorsing:
the sole selection of the Aaronids as his priests and the demotion of all other non-Aaronid Levites as their servants [Exod 28:1-4, 41-43; 29:1-9; 40:13-15; Lev 7:35-36; Num 3:5-10; 8:18-19 (contra Deut 18:1-5; 17:9, 18; 24:8; 27:9; 33:8-10)];
the sole right of the Aaronids to officiate sacrifices; and therefore the sole right of the Aaronids alone to expiate and atone for sin [Lev 1-7, and the book of Leviticus in general. See also Num 15 (contra Deut 18:1-5)];
the sole right of the Aaronids to enter the Tabernacle [Num 1:51; 3:10, 38; 18:5-7, 22];
the sole right of the Aaronids alone to touch Yahweh's holy objects [Num 4:1-19 (contra Deut 18:1-8; cf. 1 Sam 6:13-19)];
the sole selection of Aaronid priests as judges [Exod 28:30; Lev 13; Num 5:16-28 (contra Deut 17:8-13; 33:8-10)];
the sole right of the Aaronids to be able to eat Yahweh's sacrifices [Lev 6:9-11, 19-22; 10:12-15 (contra Deut 18:1-2)];
the sole right of the Aaronids as the beneficiaries of the people's firstfruit offerings and donations [Num 18:8-14; Lev 6-7];
and the sole right and privilege of the Aaronids to burn incense [Exod 30:7; Num 17:5 (contra Deut 33:10)].
All of these Yahweh-decreed pro-Aaronid privileges are only found, not surprisingly, in this text written by priests who traced their lineage back to Aaron.
Additionally, all the privileges enjoyed by the Aaronid priests and their function as Yahweh's sole ministers were also legitimated through divine decree by presenting them as ""Yahweh's eternal laws."" In other words, the Aaronid priestly guild responsible for the composition of this scroll has Yahweh decree all of the following as ""eternal law"": the anointing of the Aaronids as Yahweh's sole priests (Exod 28:1-4, 41-43; 29:9; 40:12-15; Lev 6:15; Num 10:8); the daily lamp that must be kept lit by the Aaronid priests (Exod 27:20-27; Lev 24:3, 9); Yahweh's show bread which must be displayed daily by the Aaronids (Exod 25:30); the Aaronid priesthood's portion of the sacrifices (Exod 29:28; Lev 6:11; 7:34; 10:15; 24:9); the daily sacrifice and continual fire on the altar (Exod 29:30; Lev 6:6); the washing of the Aaronid priests before they enter the Tabernacle (Exod 30:21); the prohibition of beer and wine for Aaronids before entering Yahweh's presence (Lev 10:9); and all donations, firstfruits, and sacrificial offerings belong eternally to Aaron and his sons (Num 18:8, 11, 19). In other words, the whole care and legitimation of the Aaronid priesthood and the sacrificial cult as envisioned and officiated over by the Aaronid priests themselves are repeatedly highlighted as ""Yahweh's eternal laws"" throughout the very text that they themselves wrote! Moreover, these eternal decrees occur nowhere else in the Bible but in this text, the Priestly scroll. [fn. One may find sympathetic decrees in the fourth century books of Chronicles, which also display the concerns of an Aaronid author, and the book of Ezekiel, which was apparently written by an Aaronid Zadokite priest.]
Again for readers unfamiliar with ancient Near Eastern literature---and that is most ""readers"" of the Bible---this is precisely what ancient literature did and was composed to do. Properly we would label this as propaganda---that is literature written to endorse and in this case divinely authenticate the sole authority, ideology, and beliefs of its authors."

73,"And here we go with the fucking gish Gallup (go look that up for the sake of anyone else that has to engage in a disagreement with you) once again, because you don‚Äôt understand basic logic or how to make an argument or prove anything. Just hide behind a wall of text that literally doesn‚Äôt prove what you‚Äôre trying to prove."
74,"Typical English translations on the issue are irrelevant, since most translations are interpretive rather than literal. Berlinerblau says that a literal, secular, translation of Leviticus 18:22 might read something like this:

And with a male you will not lie lying downs of a woman, It is an abomination.
In Leviticus, the specific target of the texts is sexual relations between men that occur ‚Äúon the beds of a woman‚Äù (◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô ◊ê÷¥◊©÷∏÷º◊Å÷î◊î), as Wells translates it (and this is the more accurate translation imo). The big question has to be: what does that expression ‚Äì ‚Äúon the beds of a woman‚Äù or ""lying downs of a woman"" ‚Äì mean? In 18:22, the adverbial use to describe how the lying down occurs (which results in the English translations ""as one lies with a woman"") is not supported for ◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô. Such an adverbial use would first need to be demonstrated. Additionally, while the preposition ‚Äòas‚Äô is present in all English versions, there is no equivalent in the Hebrew text. Between the words tishkav and mishkevey, one would expect the Hebrew prepositional particle ke, which means ‚Äòlike‚Äô or ‚Äòas‚Äô. However, ke is not there. The English translations are unjustified (cf. Lings, K. Renato. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòLyings‚Äô of a Woman: Male-Male Incest in Leviticus 18.22?‚Äù Theology & Sexuality, 2015). Going back to the word ""◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô,"" I think that one has to assume a locative connotation, because ◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô nearly always (I would say always) indicates a place or location. So for 18:22, the grammatical/syntactic function of ◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô is telling the reader ‚Äúwhere‚Äù you can‚Äôt lie with a man (see below). In Lev 20:13, the use of ◊û÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∞÷º◊ë÷µ÷£◊ô is appositional. The conclusion is almost inevitable, in both cases, the end result is that it is qualifying the sleeping partner in question, which limits the scope of the prohibition of the male-with-male relationship. Instead of condemning same-gender sex universally, they condemn a specific form of same-gender sex between men. Possible suggestions of interpretation are that the texts condemn male on male incest (since the main aim behind Leviticus 18-20 is to ban incestuous practices). Another potential interpretation is that the texts are basically saying, 'don‚Äôt have sex with a man who is the sexual partner of a woman.' Many different directions could be had because of the ambiguous phrase. At least four other experts of Leviticus all agree (not counting Wells and Stewart): Milgrom, Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, pp. 1569; Lings, K. Renato. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòLyings‚Äô of a Woman,‚Äù Theology & Sexuality, 2015; Joosten, Jan. ‚ÄúA New Interpretation of Leviticus 18:22 (Par. 20:13) and Its Ethical Implications,‚Äù The Journal of Theological Studies, 2020, pp. 1-10; Johanna Stiebert, First-Degree Incest and the Hebrew Bible: Sex in the Family, Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 596 [London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016], 91, 98‚Äì101).

Daniel Boyarin translates Leviticus 18:22 as:

‚ÄúDo not lie with a man a woman‚Äôs lyings"" (mi≈°kƒïbƒì  æi≈°≈°ƒÅ)
(Daniel Boyarin, The Talmud - A Personal Take, Mohr Siebeck, 2018, pp. 124).

Once again, the first phrase would seem to be a clear condemnation of same sex relations between men universally, but the author adds the very ambiguous phrase discussed above, adding another element to the prohibition, perhaps unknown to us modern readers. Bruce Wells is a legal specialist (vis-a-vis the OT) and thinks that Leviticus is not condemning sex between men universally"
75,"The most common view of Leviticus 18:22 is that it condemns male homosexual relations; however, there are prominent scholars who argue against this view. Here's what the Hebrew of Leviticus 18:22 says:

And-with a male not you-will-lie ‚Äòlyings-of‚Äô a-woman.
Now, in Hebrew, the phrase ""lyings of"" can refer to somebody's bed. So the passage basically reads ""you shall not lie with a man on the bed of a woman."" Bruce Wells (University of Texas at Austin) interprets this as meaning that ‚ÄúSex with married men, therefore, would be forbidden as well as sex with any males who are under the guardianship of a woman within the community.‚Äù Jan Joosten (formerly of Oxford University, removed following criminal conviction) concurs, arguing that the Biblical laws ‚Äúprohibit homosexual intercourse involving a married man.‚Äù

A scholarly report from the Wijngaards Institute, the authors of which includes some of the most prominent OT scholars working today (such as Mark Smith), argues that ‚Äú[the] traditional interpretation as condemning all male same-sex sexual activity is based on a mistranslation which is no longer tenable. Rather, the prohibition is limited to a specific type of male same-sex relationship.‚Äù The authors then note that ‚Äúthe fact that the prohibition addressed a specific type of male same-sex relationship suggests that same-sex intercourse with males outside the forbidden category was viewed as permissible.‚Äù

In addition, the report states that the homophobic interpretation ‚Äúcan only be reached by changing that original text considerably: it does so by adding the comparative particle ‚Äòas‚Äô, and ‚Äòwith‚Äô, both words which are absent from the Hebrew, as well as by choosing to ignore the key expression ‚Äòlyings-of.‚Äô‚Äù"
76,"If a later editor of Leviticus opposed homosexual intercourse, you might wonder, wouldn‚Äôt it have made more sense for him (and it was probably a him) to leave the original bans on homosexual incest intact?
No. The key to understanding this editorial decision is the concept of ‚Äúthe exception proves the rule.‚Äù According to this principle, the presence of an exception indicates the existence of a broader rule. For example, a sign declaring an office to be closed on Sundays suggests that the office is open on all other days of the week.
Now, apply this principle to Leviticus 18: A law declaring that homosexual incest is prohibited could reasonably be taken to indicate that non-incestuous homosexual intercourse is permitted.
Anyway following the argument advanced by Dershowitz 2017 (the academic paper you linked not his NYT opinion piece), the interpretation he's taken is this:

That the prohibitions against certain couplings in Lev 18 are mostly related to family members. His focus is on Lev 18:7-17.
They take the form ""the nakedness of X you shall not uncover"".
That the meaning of ""uncover nakedness"" is obscure, and no one definition is sufficient to explain its usage in Lev 18. He goes over the proposed solutions and finds none of them can account for every instance. This is an important point because it means it's a semantic term understood by the author and his readers, who's exact meaning has been lost. Consequently we don't understand completely what the author was intending to mean.
A redactor appears to have modified Lev 18:7 and 18:14, as highlighted below:
6 None of you shall approach anyone near of kin to uncover nakedness: I am the Lord.
7 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
8 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father‚Äôs wife; it is the nakedness of your father.
9 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father‚Äôs daughter or your mother‚Äôs daughter, whether born at home or born abroad.
10 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son‚Äôs daughter or of your daughter‚Äôs daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness.
11 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father‚Äôs wife‚Äôs daughter, begotten by your father, since she is your sister.
12 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father‚Äôs sister; she is your father‚Äôs flesh.
13 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother‚Äôs sister, for she is your mother‚Äôs flesh.
14 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father‚Äôs brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
15 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law: she is your son‚Äôs wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
16 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother‚Äôs wife; it is your brother‚Äôs nakedness.
17 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, and you shall not take her son‚Äôs daughter or her daughter‚Äôs daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are your flesh; it is depravity.
18 And you shall not take a woman as a rival to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive.
In order to insert the blanket prohibition against male same-sex coupling in Lev 18:22:

22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.
The fact that this is patchwork is obvious to anyone, when I've read this part of Leviticus before it's obvious that 18:7-17 comes from one source and 18:19-23 comes from another source. If it was all the one source 18:22 would read something along the lines of:

""You shall not uncover the nakedness of a man, for he is your X."" Where X could say something as simple as ""fellow Israelite"".

Or

""You shall not uncover the nakedness of a man, for his nakedness is your own nakedness""

So you actually don't need to read this paper and go to this depth to understand that Lev 18:7-17 is a separate set of instructions to 18:19-23 that clearly comes from a different source. It's plainly obvious as it is. However in light of 18:7, and 18:14 it would appear the original author of Lev 18:7-17 did not have in mind a blanket prohibition against male same-sex coupling, which implies that it was permissible. The redactor therefore had a choice, he could have simply removed 18:22 from the later code, or to keep it and instead remove the male family member prohibitions.

The fact that the biblical laws evolved and changed over time isn't particularly novel, Marc Zvi Brettler points it out in his book ""How to read the Bible"". He doesn't use this example, but he uses the example of the Decalogue as well as slavery laws that show later scribes that disagreed with existing laws had no problem re-interpreting them and writing down what they preferred. In Bretttler's theology, he treats the biblical texts as a ""sourcebook"" and argues that so too did many of the authors of the biblical texts as well."
77,"The word ‚Äúargument‚Äù can be used to designate a dispute or a fight, or it can be used more technically. The focus of this article is on understanding an argument as a collection of truth-bearers (that is, the things that bear truth and falsity, or are true and false) some of which are offered as reasons for one of them, the conclusion. This article takes propositions rather than sentences or statements or utterances to be the primary truth bearers. The reasons offered within the argument are called ‚Äúpremises‚Äù, and the proposition that the premises are offered for is called the ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù. This sense of ‚Äúargument‚Äù diverges not only from the above sense of a dispute or fight but also from the formal logician‚Äôs sense according to which an argument is merely a list of statements, one of which is designated as the conclusion and the rest of which are designated as premises regardless of whether the premises are offered as reasons for believing the conclusion. Arguments, as understood in this article, are the subject of study in critical thinking and informal logic courses in which students usually learn, among other things, how to identify, reconstruct, and evaluate arguments given outside the classroom.

Arguments, in this sense, are typically distinguished from both implications and inferences. In asserting that a proposition P implies proposition Q, one does not thereby offer P as a reason for Q. The proposition frogs are mammals implies that frogs are not reptiles, but it is problematic to offer the former as a reason for believing the latter. If an arguer offers an argument in order to persuade an audience that the conclusion is true, then it is plausible to think that the arguer is inviting the audience to make an inference from the argument‚Äôs premises to its conclusion. However, an inference is a form of reasoning, and as such it is distinct from an argument in the sense of a collection of propositions (some of which are offered as reasons for the conclusion). One might plausibly think that a person S infers Q from P just in case S comes to believe Q because S believes that P is true and because S believes that the truth of P justifies belief that Q. But this movement of mind from P to Q is something different from the argument composed of just P and Q.

The characterization of argument in the first paragraph requires development since there are forms of reasoning such as explanations which are not typically regarded as arguments even though (explanatory) reasons are offered for a proposition. Two principal approaches to fine-tuning this first-step characterization of arguments are what may be called the structural and pragmatic approaches. The pragmatic approach is motivated by the view that the nature of an argument cannot be completely captured in terms of its structure. In what follows, each approach is described, and criticism is briefly entertained.  Along the way, distinctive features of arguments are highlighted that seemingly must be accounted for by any plausible characterization. The classification of arguments as deductive, inductive, and conductive is discussed in section 3."
78,"1.	The Structural Approach to Characterizing Arguments

Not any group of propositions qualifies as an argument. The starting point for structural approaches is the thesis that the premises of an argument are reasons offered in support of its conclusion (for example, Govier 2010, p.1, Bassham, G., W. Irwin, H. Nardone, J. Wallace 2005, p.30, Copi and Cohen 2005, p.7; for discussion, see Johnson 2000, p.146ff ). Accordingly, a collection of propositions lacks the structure of an argument unless there is a reasoner who puts forward some as reasons in support of one of them. Letting P1, P2, P3, ‚Ä¶, and C range over propositions and R over reasoners, a structural characterization of argument takes the following form.

 A collection of propositions, P1, ‚Ä¶, Pn, C, is an argument if and only if there is a reasoner R who puts forward the Pi as reasons in support of C.

The structure of an argument is not a function of the syntactic and semantic features of the propositions that compose it. Rather, it is imposed on these propositions by the intentions of a reasoner to use some as support for one of them. Typically in presenting an argument, a reasoner will use expressions to flag the intended structural components of her argument. Typical premise indicators include: ‚Äúbecause‚Äù, ‚Äúsince‚Äù, ‚Äúfor‚Äù, and ‚Äúas‚Äù; typical conclusion indicators include ‚Äútherefore‚Äù, ‚Äúthus‚Äù, ‚Äúhence‚Äù, and ‚Äúso‚Äù. Note well: these expressions do not always function in these ways, and so their mere use does not necessitate the presence of an argument.

Different accounts of the nature of the intended support offered by the premises for the conclusion in an argument generate different structural characterizations of arguments (for discussion see Hitchcock 2007). Plausibly, if a reasoner R puts forward premises in support of a conclusion C, then (i)-(iii) obtain. (i) The premises represent R‚Äôs reasons for believing that the conclusion is true and R thinks that her belief in the truth of the premises is justified. (ii) R believes that the premises make C more probable than not. (iii) (a) R believes that the premises are independent of C ( that is, R thinks that her reasons for the premises do not include belief that C is true), and (b) R believes that the premises are relevant to establishing that C is true. If we judge that a reasoner R presents an argument as defined above, then by the lights of (i)-(iii) we believe that R believes that the premises justify belief in the truth of the conclusion.  In what immediately follows, examples are given to explicate (i)-(iii).

A: John is an only child.

B: John is not an only child; he said that Mary is his sister.

If B presents an argument, then the following obtain. (i) B believes that the premise ( that is, Mary is John‚Äôs sister) is true, B thinks this belief is justified, and the premise is B‚Äôs reason for maintaining the conclusion. (ii) B believes that John said that Mary is his sister makes it more likely than not that John is not an only child, and (iii) B thinks that that John said that Mary is his sister is both independent of the proposition that Mary is John‚Äôs sister and relevant to confirming it.

A: The Democrats and Republicans don‚Äôt seem willing to compromise.

B: If the Democrats and Republicans are not willing to compromise, then the U.S. will go over the fiscal cliff.

B‚Äôs assertion of a conditional does not require that B believe either the antecedent or consequent. Therefore, it is unlikely that B puts forward the Democrats and Republicans are not willing to compromise as a reason in support of the U.S. will go over the fiscal cliff, because it is unlikely that B believes either proposition. Hence, it is unlikely that B‚Äôs response to A has the structure of an argument, because (i) is not satisfied.

A: Doctor B, what is the reason for my uncle‚Äôs muscular weakness?

B: The results of the test are in. Even though few syphilis patients get paresis, we suspect that the reason for your uncle‚Äôs paresis is the syphilis he suffered from 10 years ago.

Dr. B offers reasons that explain why A‚Äôs uncle has paresis. It is unreasonable to think that B believes that the uncle‚Äôs being a syphilis victim makes it more likely than not that he has paresis, since B admits that having syphilis does not make it more likely than not that someone has (or will have) paresis. So, B‚Äôs response does not contain an argument, because (ii) is not satisfied.

A: I don‚Äôt think that Bill will be at the party tonight.

B: Bill will be at the party, because Bill will be at the party.

Suppose that B believes that Bill will be at the party. Trivially, the truth of this proposition makes it more likely than not that he will be at the party. Nevertheless, B is not presenting an argument.  B‚Äôs response does not have the structure of an argument, because (iiia) is not satisfied. Clearly, B does not offer a reason for Bill will be at the party that is independent of this. Perhaps, B‚Äôs response is intended to communicate her confidence that Bill will be at the party. By (iiia), a reasoner R puts forward [1] Sasha Obama has a sibling in support of [2] Sasha is not an only child only if R‚Äôs reasons for believing [1] do not include R‚Äôs belief that [2] is true. If R puts forward [1] in support of [2] and, say, erroneously believes that the former is independent of the latter, then R‚Äôs argument would be defective by virtue of being circular. Regarding (iiib), that Obama is U.S. President entails that the earth is the third planet from the sun or it isn‚Äôt, but it is plausible to suppose that the former does not support the latter because it is irrelevant to showing that the earth is the third planet from the sun or it isn‚Äôt is true.

Premises offered in support of a conclusion are either linked or convergent. This difference marks a structural distinction between arguments.

[1] Tom is happy only if he is playing guitar.
[2] Tom is not playing guitar.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚à¥ [3] Tom is not happy.

Suppose that a reasoner R offers [1] and [2] as reasons in support of [3]. The argument is presented in what is called standard form; the premises are listed first and a solid line separates them from the conclusion, which is prefaced by ‚Äú‚à¥‚Äù. This symbol means ‚Äútherefore‚Äù. Premises [1] and [2] are linked because they do not support the conclusion independently of one another,  that is, they support the conclusion jointly. It is unreasonable to think that R offers [1] and [2] individually, as opposed to collectively, as reasons for [3]. The following representation of the argument depicts the linkage of the premises.

convergent
 
Combining [1] and [2] with the plus sign and underscoring them indicates that they are linked. The arrow indicates that they are offered in support of [3]. To see a display of convergent premises, consider the following.

[1] Tom said that he didn‚Äôt go to Samantha‚Äôs party.
[2] No one at Samantha‚Äôs party saw Tom there.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚à¥ [3] Tom did not attend Samantha‚Äôs party.

These premises are convergent, because each is a reason that supports [3] independently of the other. The below diagram represents this.

divergent
 
An extended argument is an argument with at least one premise that a reasoner attempts to support explicitly. Extended arguments are more structurally complex than ones that are not extended. Consider the following.

The keys are either in the kitchen or the bedroom. The keys are not in the kitchen. I did not find the keys in the kitchen. So, the keys must be in the bedroom. Let‚Äôs look there!

The argument in standard form may be portrayed as follows:

[1] I just searched the kitchen and I did not find the keys.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚à¥ [2] The keys are not in the kitchen.
[3] The keys are either in the kitchen or the bedroom.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚à¥ [4] The keys are in the bedroom.

multiple

Note that although the keys being in the bedroom is a reason for the imperative, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look there!‚Äù (given the desirability of finding the keys), this proposition is not ‚Äútruth apt‚Äù and so is not a component of the argument.
An enthymeme is an argument which is presented with at least one component that is suppressed.

A: I don‚Äôt know what to believe regarding the morality of abortion.

B: You should believe that abortion is immoral. You‚Äôre a Catholic.

That B puts forward [1] A is a Catholic in support of [2] A should believe that abortion is immoral suggests that B implicitly puts forward [3] all Catholics should believe that abortion is immoral in support of [2]. Proposition [3] may plausibly be regarded as a suppressed premise of B‚Äôs argument. Note that [2] and [3] are linked. A premise that is suppressed is never a reason for a conclusion independent of another explicitly offered for that conclusion.

There are two main criticisms of structural characterizations of arguments. One criticism is that they are too weak because they turn non-arguments such as explanations into arguments.

A: Why did this metal expand?

B: It was heated and all metals expand when heated.

B offers explanatory reasons for the explanandum (what is explained): this metal expanded. It is plausible to see B offering these explanatory reasons in support of the explanandum. The reasons B offers jointly support the truth of the explanandum, and thereby show that the expansion of the metal was to be expected. It is in this way that B‚Äôs reasons enable A to understand why the metal expanded.

The second criticism is that structural characterizations are too strong. They rule out as arguments what intuitively seem to be arguments.

A: Kelly maintains that no explanation is an argument. I don‚Äôt know what to believe.

B: Neither do I. One reason for her view may be that the primary function of arguments, unlike explanations, is persuasion. But I am not sure that this is the primary function of arguments. We should investigate this further."
79,"B offers a reason, [1] the primary function of arguments, unlike explanations, is persuasion, for the thesis [2] no explanation is an argument. Since B asserts neither [1] nor [2], B does not put forward [1] in support of [2]. Hence, by the above account, B‚Äôs reasoning does not qualify as an argument. A contrary view is that arguments can be used in ways other than showing that their conclusions are true. For example, arguments can be constructed for purposes of inquiry and as such can be used to investigate a hypothesis by seeing what reasons might be given to support a given proposition (see Meiland 1989 and Johnson and Blair 2006, p.10). Such arguments are sometimes referred to as exploratory arguments.  On this approach, it is plausible to think that B constructs an exploratory argument [exercise for the reader: identify B‚Äôs suppressed premise].

Briefly, in defense of the structuralist account of arguments one response to the first criticism is to bite the bullet and follow those who think that at least some explanations qualify as arguments (see Thomas 1986 who argues that all explanations are arguments). Given that there are exploratory arguments, the second criticism motivates either liberalizing the concept of support that premises may provide for a conclusion (so that, for example, B may be understood as offering [1] in support of [2]) or dropping the notion of support all together in the structural characterization of arguments (for example, a collection of propositions is an argument if and only if a reasoner offers some as reasons for one of them. See Sinnott-Armstrong and Fogelin 2010, p.3)."
80,"2.	The Pragmatic Approach to Characterizing Arguments

The pragmatic approach is motivated by the view that the nature of an argument cannot be completely captured in terms of its structure. In contrast to structural definitions of arguments, pragmatic definitions appeal to the function of arguments. Different accounts of the purposes arguments serve generate different pragmatic definitions of arguments. The following pragmatic definition appeals to the use of arguments as tools of rational persuasion (for definitions of argument that make such an appeal, see Johnson 2000, p. 168; Walton 1996, p. 18ff; Hitchcock 2007, p.105ff)

A collection of propositions is an argument if and only if there is a reasoner R who puts forward some of them (the premises) as reasons in support of one of them (the conclusion) in order to rationally persuade an audience of the truth of the conclusion.

One advantage of this definition over the previously given structural one is that it offers an explanation why arguments have the structure they do. In order to rationally persuade an audience of the truth of a proposition, one must offer reasons in support of that proposition. The appeal to rational persuasion is necessary to distinguish arguments from other forms of persuasion such as threats. One question that arises is: What obligations does a reasoner incur by virtue of offering supporting reasons for a conclusion in order to rationally persuade an audience of the conclusion? One might think that such a reasoner should be open to criticisms and obligated to respond to them persuasively (See Johnson 2000 p.144 et al, for development of this idea). By appealing to the aims that arguments serve, pragmatic definitions highlight the acts of presenting an argument in addition to the arguments themselves. The field of argumentation, an interdisciplinary field that includes rhetoric, informal logic, psychology, and cognitive science, highlights acts of presenting arguments and their contexts as topics for investigation that inform our understanding of arguments (see Houtlosser 2001 for discussion of the different perspectives of argument offered by different fields).

For example, the acts of explaining and arguing‚Äîin sense highlighted here‚Äîhave different aims.  Whereas the act of explaining is designed to increase the audience‚Äôs comprehension, the act of arguing is aimed at enhancing the acceptability of a standpoint. This difference in aim makes sense of the fact that in presenting an argument the reasoner believes that her standpoint is not yet acceptable to her audience, but in presenting an explanation the reasoner knows or believes that the explanandum is already accepted by her audience (See van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992, p.29, and Snoeck Henkemans 2001, p.232). These observations about the acts of explaining and arguing motivate the above pragmatic definition of an argument and suggest that arguments and explanations are distinct things. It is generally accepted that the same line of reasoning can function as an explanation in one dialogical context and as an argument in another (see Groarke and Tindale 2004, p. 23ff for an example and discussion). Eemeren van, Grootendorst, and Snoeck Henkemans 2002 delivers a substantive account of how the evaluation of various types of arguments turns on considerations pertaining to the dialogical contexts within which they are presented and discussed.

Note that, since the pragmatic definition appeals to the structure of propositions in characterizing arguments, it inherits the criticisms of structural definitions. In addition, the question arises whether it captures the variety of purposes arguments may serve. It has been urged that arguments can aim at engendering any one of a full range of attitudes towards their conclusions (for example, Pinto 1991). For example, a reasoner can offer premises for a conclusion C in order to get her audience to withhold assent from C, suspect that C is true, believe that is merely possible that C is true, or to be afraid that C is true.

The thought here is that these are alternatives to convincing an audience of the truth of C. A proponent of a pragmatic definition of argument may grant that there are uses of arguments not accounted for by her definition, and propose that the definition is stipulative. But then a case needs to be made why theorizing about arguments from a pragmatic approach should be anchored to such a definition when it does not reflect all legitimate uses of arguments. Another line of criticism of the pragmatic approach is its rejecting that arguments themselves have a function (Goodwin 2007) and arguing that the function of persuasion should be assigned to the dialogical contexts in which arguments take place (Doury 2011)."
81,"3.	Deductive, Inductive, and Conductive Arguments

Arguments are commonly classified as deductive or inductive (for example, Copi, I. and C. Cohen 2005, Sinnott-Armstrong and Fogelin 2010). A deductive argument is an argument that an arguer puts forward as valid. For a valid argument, it is not possible for the premises to be true with the conclusion false. That is, necessarily if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true. Thus we may say that the truth of the premises in a valid argument guarantees that the conclusion is also true. The following is an example of a valid argument: Tom is happy only if the Tigers win, the Tigers lost; therefore, Tom is definitely not happy.

A step-by-step derivation of the conclusion of a valid argument from its premises is called a proof. In the context of a proof, the given premises of an argument may be viewed as initial premises. The propositions produced at the steps leading to the conclusion are called derived premises. Each step in the derivation is justified by a principle of inference. Whether the derived premises are components of a valid argument is a difficult question that is beyond the scope of this article.   

An inductive argument is an argument that an arguer puts forward as inductively strong. In an inductive argument, the premises are intended only to be so strong that, if they were true, then it would be unlikely, although possible, that the conclusion is false. If the truth of the premises makes it unlikely (but not impossible) that the conclusion is false, then we may say that the argument is inductively strong. The following is an example of an inductively strong argument: 97% of the Republicans in town Z voted for McX, Jones is a Republican in town Z; therefore, Jones voted for McX.

In an argument like this, an arguer often will conclude ‚ÄúJones probably voted for McX‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúJones voted for McX,‚Äù because they are signaling with the word ‚Äúprobably‚Äù that they intend to present an argument that is inductively strong but not valid.

In order to evaluate an argument it is important to determine whether or not it is deductive or inductive. It is inappropriate to criticize an inductively strong argument for being invalid. Based on the above characterizations, whether an argument is deductive or inductive turns on whether the arguer intends the argument to be valid or merely inductively strong, respectively. Sometimes the presence of certain expressions such as ‚Äòdefinitely‚Äô and ‚Äòprobably‚Äô in the above two arguments indicate the relevant intensions of the arguer. Charity dictates that an invalid argument which is inductively strong be evaluated as an inductive argument unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.

Conductive arguments have been put forward as a third category of arguments (for example, Govier 2010). A conductive argument is an argument whose premises are convergent; the premises count separately in support of the conclusion. If one or more premises were removed from the argument, the degree of support offered by the remaining premises would stay the same. The previously given example of an argument with convergent premises is a conductive argument. The following is another example of a conductive argument. It most likely won‚Äôt rain tomorrow. The sky is red tonight. Also, the weather channel reported a 30% chance of rain for tomorrow.

The primary rationale for distinguishing conductive arguments from deductive and inductive ones is as follows. First, the premises of conductive arguments are always convergent, but the premises of deductive and inductive arguments are never convergent. Second, the evaluation of arguments with convergent premises requires not only that each premise be evaluated individually as support for the conclusion, but also the degree to which the premises support the conclusion collectively must be determined. This second consideration mitigates against treating conductive arguments merely as a collection of subarguments, each of which is deductive or inductive. The basic idea is that the support that the convergent premises taken together provide the conclusion must be considered in the evaluation of a conductive argument. With respect to the above conductive argument, the sky is red tonight and the weather channel reported a 30% chance of rain for tomorrow are offered together as (convergent) reasons for It most likely won‚Äôt rain tomorrow. Perhaps, collectively, but not individually, these reasons would persuade an addressee that it most likely won‚Äôt rain tomorrow.

4.	Conclusion

A group of propositions constitutes an argument only if some are offered as reasons for one of them. Two approaches to identifying the definitive characteristics of arguments are the structural and pragmatic approaches. On both approaches, whether an act of offering reasons for a proposition P yields an argument depends on what the reasoner believes regarding both the truth of the reasons and the relationship between the reasons and P. A typical use of an argument is to rationally persuade its audience of the truth of the conclusion. To be effective in realizing this aim, the reasoner must think that there is real potential in the relevant context for her audience to be rationally persuaded of the conclusion by means of the offered premises. What, exactly, this presupposes about the audience depends on what the argument is and the context in which it is given. An argument may be classified as deductive, inductive, or conductive. Its classification into one of these categories is a prerequisite for its proper evaluation."
