1,"The Pew Research Center in 2020 found that 65% of Americans identify as Christian.

In 1990, it was 85%. In 2015, it was 75%.

Currently in the US, Christians outnumber religious ""nones"" by a little over 2 to 1. In 2007, that ratio was 5 to 1.

Looks like Christianity isn't as ""unstoppable"" as they like to pretend it is."
2,"Funny thing, muslims said the same thing about Islam."
3,"[**What’s the latest on church attendance in America?**](https://churchleaders.com/pastors/pastor-articles/139575-7-startling-facts-an-up-close-look-at-church-attendance-in-america.html)

1. Less than 20 percent of Americans regularly attend church—half of what the pollsters report.
While Gallup polls and other statisticians have turned in the same percentage—about 40 percent of the population—of average weekend church attendees for the past 70 years, a different sort of research paints quite a disparate picture of how many Christians in American attend a local church on any given Sunday.

_Numbers from actual counts of people in Orthodox Christian churches (Catholic, mainline and evangelical) show that in 2004, 17.7 percent of the population attended a Christian church on any given weekend._"
4,Good luck taking Czechia!  Or India!
5,"I don't know about the West, Latin America, or Africa. But if they came to China or India for the sake of domination. I can give a 100% guarantee, that India and China will forget their differences just like that. And boom, Christians' wet dream has gone XD."
6,Thousand-Year Reich energy
7,"Oh, I can wait. Really, I'm good."
8,These zealots that want to FORCE their religion on you legit scares me
9,"“Christianity” did control most of the western world at one point. Almost all rulers were accountable to a pope or the church in some way. It lead to some of the worst atrocities known to mankind, as well as corruption on a level that hasn’t been seen since. Christian influence has been on the down slope for awhile and that shows no signs of changing."
10,LFG. keep it going baby
11,"So people *say* they go to church, but don’t?"
12,Cool. I kinda like not being nailed to a letter.
13,They say a lot of things to pollsters. Often they are lies.
