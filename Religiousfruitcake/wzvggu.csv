1,"Also no atheist ever claimed atheism was the religion of peace, since, you know, it's not a religion."
2,"Yeah, racism automatically disqualifies you from the moral high ground."
3,"None of them spoke English, but the only one with an accent is the asian"
4,I really just want to curb stomp the person who made this.
5,"""I have to lie so I can misrepresent the lack of belief in gods. Surely I have the moral high ground."""
6,Wrong and racist? Just what everyone wanted.
7,It has nothing to do with atheism
8,"I really don't think Christians want to step up to the plate for the ""religion body count"" game."
9,"Didn‚Äôt god kill everyone on the planet and only spare Noah and his family? I mean, it isn‚Äôt as many people, but percentages are more telling than actual number of dead when it comes to genocide."
10,I‚Äôve always loved that they think atheism is a religion. Like loads of people get together to not believe in stuff.
11,How many people died because Christians held back the progress of science?
12,Why do they think atheism is a religion?
13,[deleted]
14,OMG NO IPHONE 100 MORBILLION DeAD??!!
15,"But like, Chinese accent doesn't even sound like that? Misreading L's as R's is a Japanese thing, Chinese don't even roll their R's"
16,"They were sociopathic, totalitarian, megalomaniacal, mass murdering, shitheels.

Their religious beliefs are a little further down the list, IMO."
17,"Except that Chinese has an L sound, it's Japanese that doesn't, so replaces it with Rs."
18,How does someone kill someone in the name of atheism‚Ä¶??
19,So much wrong in such a small space.
20,"They didn't kill in the name of not believing in a god (*atheism*), but in the name of their specific ideology of communism (*Maoism/Stalinism*), and christians have killed hundreds of thousands and destroyed multiple cultures which has an effect even in the modern day.                    


They drew their own boarders of Africa, split up tribes that got along and forced others together. They made countries unstable while doing their best to manipuly tribes into becoming christian. They stole land even after some of the Native Americans taught them how to grow some of the New World crops and shared some land with them. They killed even their own people by accusing them of being ""*witches*"" and ""*heretics*"". Even till today, many deaths happen due to christian influence. There are countries who also killed gay people and some which still do, because of the verses in the bible which says to kill gay people and the bible influenced the Muslim religion, and there are Muslim countries killing gay people too.                


Christians have done so much damage to the world. The doctrines go so deeply into the mind, that even some ex-christians who don't believe in it anymore, struggle to undo some of the indoctrination, and it can take a long time to undo."
21,"A fellow Christian of their is also a mass murderer, yet was conviniently left out of the discussion. It was the man, the myth, the legend himself, Mr. Adolf Hitler. Please welcome the most hated man who represent Christian mass murderer"
22,"As an Athiest here in the United States, I simply want religious people to not waste their time trying to ""convert"" me.

That's it. I have no problems with them being who they are."
23,"""I murdered the entire world, except for a few people, and a bunch of animals"" - God"
24,"The religion of fascist authoritarian dictatorships.  You know, like what the christo-fascist white nationalists want."
25,"Is this a parody?

I mean, I know the religous can be this blind and arrogant, but holy shit this is so over the top."
26,"‚ÄúSo why did you only give Mao exaggerated racist speech and not give Stalin an Eastern European accent?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù"
27,"Atheists commiting genocide is like how a straight guy would rape a gay guy.

It's just to show dominance, nothing else."
28,"The regimes of Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao Zedong & Kim Jong Un all easily & comfortably qualify as surrogate religions; the methods of oppression they use were all co-opted & heavily utilised by religion long before they turned up.

Also, all totalitarianism is inherently theocratic: the central aim of totalitarianism - an unalterable, unanswerable, unchallengable & unending authority with total, supreme authority over everyone & everything, now & forever - is in complete concordance with the properties of the God of the monotheistic Abrahamic religions. Every tyrant the world over aspires to be what this God already is, it is an innately supernatural proposition.

Finally, it isn't possible to kill in the name of atheism. Not only is it not a religion, it is not even a belief system.

There's no holy book or sacred scriptures, no pope to dictate dogma, no central institution to promote & enforce doctrine, no designated authorities to interpret teachings. There are no rituals or holy rites, there are no mandatory practices or beliefs independent of the base definition of the term.

In short, there is no source material of any kind to provide a logical framework & path of reasoning that would lead an atheist to kill in the name of atheism."
29,"I‚Äôm surprised Stalin‚Äôs line doesn‚Äôt go:
‚ÄúHow myeny you keel in nyame of atheesm? I murder 60 meelyon.‚Äù"
30,"Truth be told, Starvation did most of the heavy lifting... 

you know just like the English did to the Irish, or the Americans, and Spanish when they were passing out blankets back in the day..."
31,Just because they weren‚Äôt the leaders of theocracies does not mean they did what they did in the name of atheism
32,"Any time someone suggests atheism is a religion, anything else they say gets laughed off and disregarded."
33,Least racist Christian fundamentalist
34,"I love how mention the genocide of First People in North America, South America, Australia and NZ; Africans; Asians; Pagans; Jews; Muslims; Buddhists; Hindus; and Sikhs are all swept under the carpet."
35,A trillion gazillion.
36,"Should we tell them about the nazis, and the crusades, and the natives of canada?"
37,You know what kills people? Death! You know who invented death? God!
38,"This is awfully wrong and racist at the same time, geeze. 
But let‚Äôs talk about how many people died under capitalism and ‚Äúspreading democracy!‚Äù"
39,"Ah yeah, targeting ethnic groups to suppress resistance to USSR and Stalinism was truly ""for the cause of Atheism""! Boy, am I tired."
40,The problem with this mindset is the fact that the death numbers have actually been proven as overreported.
41,Why did I read this in Trey Parker's voice?
42,"1. Atheism is not a religion, no matter how much people claim it is.
2. I would argue that Maoism and Marxism-Leninism are religions due to their reverence towards Mao and Lenin, respectively."
43,"Yeah I think authoritarian communism was doing the heavy lifting there. Take it up with the Tankies, your run of mill lefty atheist isn't exactly a Mao simp, and most of the Tankies nowadays find more common cause with Putin and the Alt-Right than with us. Just my 2 cents."
44,Replacing religious dogma with political dogma.
45,Communism does kill and oppress many millions
46,There were christian commies in my country who were killing and sending people to gulags It really has nothing to do with atheism.
47,"Another good, center left, non-theist sub transformed into a tankie one. *sigh*"
48,"Is the latter part of the title of this post trying to downplay the body count from communist regimes though?

edit:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll#Political_leaders_and_regimes"
49,The only thing those two have in common is that they are conservative authoritarians.
50,"Yes, Stalin killed 20 million people because of atheism 

Not because he was a mad man who thought he could be a communist and hoard wealth while his people starved"
51,"OP I hate to break it to you, but those are the actually numbers of deaths attributed to those men.  I'm not like a capitalism simp or anything but they aren't trying to exaggerate the numbers here."
52,"I do agree that communism is bad, but that‚Äôs just racism."
53,Mao did kill around 50 million people. Denying it is just straight up denying history.
54,"Don't like the meme, but also don't like you downplaying the horrors of those particular communist states either."
55,"I heard they both wore brown shoes, so probably it was the brown shoes‚Ä¶."
56,Y didnt they make stalin racist speech. They arent even putting their backs into it. Lazy bigotry.
57,hum what?
58,The ignorance and abject racism is astounding.
59,Genghis Khan killed an estimated 40 million people.  That was 11% of the world's population at the time.
60,How many did God kill?
61,"Ah yes, they definitely killed people ‚Äòin the name of atheism‚Äô"
62,"WWII era Looney Tunes called, they want their racist stereotypes back."
63,"Atheism 

Religion"
64,"""In the name of atheism"" ü§î

Point to the atheistic literature that serves as the unquestionable command to do ANYTHING. 

And then explain how it has any authority."
65,"The Chinese language also has the letter L in it so they have no issue pronouncing it. This is not only wrong as fuck, it‚Äôs racist as fuck."
66,I don't know if giving the Chinese guy a Japanese accent is doing racism wrong or doing it extra right
67,"Stalin was raised a devout Greek Orthodox and his father was a Greek Orthodox priest.

During WWII he allowed tens of thousands of Greek Orthodox churches to open and re-established the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox church, which is the officially sanctioned church in Russia today where all other churches are suppressed.

Yes, he declared himself an atheist, but if his intent was to use his atheism to destroy religion he did so in neither word or deed."
68,So that would make them the Religion of Stereotypical Racism?
69,"Got to love, that while 100's of millions of deaths can be directly and irrefutably tied to specific religions. Directly to how those religions act, and the things they do, because of the religion. But the best they can do is lay deaths that happened for things that had nothing to do with atheism or its world view on atheists. Lots of people died because of these two, no doubt. But it had exactly nothing to do with them being atheist on any level. Using this logic, then any literally ALL other deaths that have ever happened would be layed at religions feet. Any time a religious leader is in power, which is basically all the time, any deaths under them are the religions fault. 

But that isn't how any of us actually count it, though again, by this logic, it is how we should. Instead, we count it by those who used the religion to kill or cause death. And even under those terms, all the major religions each still have far higher body counts then this."
70,*sigh* atheism is not a religion. Why can't they understand that?
71,i don‚Äôt understand how ppl think atheism is a religion lmfao
72,"Quick open question to anyone who might be interested. Were stalin or mao religious themselves? Just because they made everyone else literally stop being religious out of all other things as well. Did they still believe themselves? In china I'm sure religion exists there now but I saw this part of a documentary where the people of some home or school or something had a shrine for mao with catholic like symbolism around it. Not that it had to do with actual mao's doings but what does that mean in a way, just an old thought I had. 

Sorry about the sort of blabbering."
73,"Both killed for political reasons. Also, why did the person who made this just have to be racist?"
74,Why didnt they give stalin an accent?..wtf are giving anyone an accent
75,Christianity has killed 700 million
76,They must've never heard of the crusades....
77,"non stamp collecting killed 140 million according to these ""memelords"""
78,Neither of those men were atheists for the record.
79,"Okay, since we‚Äôve broken the seal on it, let‚Äôs start digging in to how many people died in wars of religion, shall we?"
80,Ignorant and racist
81,"This is absurd and racist, but Mao and Stalin did kill millions of people in the name of communism. Each one of them killed tens of millions. I‚Äôve seen comments here defending them, that‚Äôs just as bad as defending Hitler and that makes me sick."
82,"reminds me of an amazing non stamp collector video that basically made the point that all the famous murderous ""atheists"" killed for ideological reasons and not their religion, meanwhile theres lets just say... a few examples of religious people whove done similarly terrible things for their religion.

its ok to be religious and non religious, just dont kill people for dumb reasons ok?"
83,"Literally noone calls atheism a religion of peace because it isn't a religion or even a unified philosophy.

And it's not like those numbers came from shite like political purges, chronic mismanagement, ideologically driven faux 'science', it was definitely athiesm."
84,FUCK YOU DOLPHIN AND WHALE!!
85,"I think it's really a window into these people's thought processes. Even putting aside the gross stereotyping, it's curious how they persist in viewing atheism as a religion. As if a zero sum is incomprehensible. They can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea that there's no organization, you don't go to atheist meetings and plan your strategy against Christianity. Is it willful? Or just plain ig'nant?"
86,"Always funny to me that they miss the point that people and various religions literally kill ""in the name of God"", whereas no one has ever killed in the name of atheism. But, then again, braining is hard."
87,"I'd like to hear one historian from a credible school claim they killed people in the name of atheism. Find a single one.

I'd like someone to ask Jordan Peterson this question as well, since he cares so much about academic integrity. . ."
88,Ughh‚Ä¶ 2 dictators vs realistic world view‚Ä¶ muh freedoms‚Ä¶
89,It's not even communism lol. Real communism is harmless. It's tyranism/depotism that killed people.
90,"Lmao even if that were being disingenuous, those are still rookie numbers compared to the blood on Christianity's hands"
91,Why doesn‚Äôt Stalin have a Russian accent?
92,"Atheism isn‚Äôt a religion but please don‚Äôt pretend like communism works.  If you mock religious nuts for desperately insisting young earth creationism and literal interpretation of the Bible works, then turn around and desperately insist communism works, you need a good look in the mirror."
93,They killed people because they were totalitarian megalomaniacs. The communist witch hunt of the 1950‚Äôs did a number on the older generations.
94,Atheism isn't an ideology so it can't be ideologically responsible for genocide
95,if this was satire it‚Äôd be better
96,Does Christianity and it‚Äôs denominations not claim to be the religion(s) of peace?
97,"God pulling up like ‚Äúthose are sissy numbers. You should see how many j got when Noah was around alone, and that‚Äôs before we get into the rest of it‚Äù"
98,"In 1951 the r√°kosi regime enacted a new law to van religious gatherings for every faith, except for one, Buddhism. Why? It wasn't because it's a small faith ok Hungary, Islam pulls similar numbers.

The reason was that allowing Buddhist monks to come to Hungary for ""cultural exchange"" was the perfect cover for Chinese agents to suss out subversive behavior among Chinese and Korean students staying in hungary during the Korean War.

Of course, these holier than thou biblethumpers know that Soviet and chinese style socialism wasn't atheistic in its true sense. Both strived, just like the Nazis to create the new 20th century human by deep indoctrination.

One shouldn't even mention that victims of communism very often contain civilian casualties of wwii as well as those numbers concern how many died in their territories, not by what and how."
99,"2-6 million people died in the crusades, when the population of Europe at the time was 70 million. In 1957, the population of Europe was 160 million, China was 552 million. During the Taiping rebellion, 20 million people died in a 430 million populous China."
100,Nah fam. I‚Äôm a liberal. Also Taiwan is a country. And Slava Ukraine
