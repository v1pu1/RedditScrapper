1,"BWAHAHAHAHA!  They think we have a ""God!"""
2,"That’s baphomet, not Satan. Trust these dumbasses to get their demons wrong"
3,Technically christians have a god that impregnated his own mother with himself.
4,"Several points here

Satanists use satan and baphomet as symbols, they do not actually believe in or worship these entities

Satanists don’t indoctrinate children, the church of Satan is big on the separation of religion of all forms from the state to prevent such things

These deities are actually the product of Christianity, you will find more Christians who believe satan the entity is real and has power over the world than satanists who believe satan the entity is real and has power over the world

Jesus fucked his own mother to conceive himself and then people got drunk off his blood so what makes you think you can even look at satanism and think it’s fucked up"
5,"i was raised in baptist bible belt hell and god was absolutely 100% a male. which is why it sucked being a girl so much. 

are there actual christians raised with a gender ambiguous god?"
6,"""I'm an atheist. I don't believe in god(s).""

""So you worship Satan?""

""..."""
7,"Just ask as ingeniously as you can : ""If Adam was made in God's image and he  was hermaphrodite, wouldn't this mean that god is too?""  Enjoy their meltdown as they desperately try to cope with it."
8,"i was raised catholic, went to catholic school, and was almost a nun. they told us to refer to God as whatever gender made us the most comfortable because he is everything or something along those lines. Sorry I don’t really remember the reasoning but the calling him whatever made us comfortable part stuck with me."
9,The Knights Templar are indoctrinating our children?
10,I'm pretty sure the bible calls their God He. Multiple times in fact.
11,"Whatever gender you think they are, most scholars agree that they have an amazing bush!"
12,When did Satan get a boob job done?
13,"Male pronouns, male God, even El is a generic name for male god.  I think Asherah might be the name of generic female god."
14,I don't think they understand what 'indoctrination' means.
15,Baphomet is not even a real demon.
16,"Their god is also trans-speciel... if that's a word.

Like Zeus, who had sex with a woman while in the form of a swan, their god turned into a pigeon to impregnate a virgin.

I mean, WHO DOES THAT?"
17,Whose the goat bird fella
18,God has taken the form of a bush. Well it was an Angel but if an angel can become a bush… god can to
19,"Half of the satan's body is from a fucking goat, but the problem is his boobs?"
20,The Christian God has NO female counterpart. He is all big dick energy.
21,Imagine being more concerned that someone is transgender than half human/half goat.
22,"This generation of children is more tolerant and accepting of the LGBT community than any that came before, and their transphobic/homophobic parents and grandparents are PISSED."
23,Aren’t angels supposed to be sexless beings? Or beings beyond sex?
24,TIL Baphomet has a nice pair of chesticles.
25,"Not entirely the point, but what gesture is baphomet throwing? Looks like its trying to shoot heaven and the ground simultaniously"
26,"I guess I've been skipping church or something, big-titty Satan is news to me."
27,Yeah sure and we eat babies for breakfast.
28,"Pretty sure I don't worship a god but let me check again. Nope, still don't."
29,"Thats old Baph bro! That's not even a god, ha ha ha"
30,"I had a pastor go on a huge rant about how gender is determined by gonads only to turn around and complain that people weren’t using he/him pronouns for God. And to be clear, the guy did not think that God had male gonads. Man was dense."
31,"Because we all know Christians NEVER try to indoctrinate CHILDREN right, guys? Guys?"
32,"If God exists he is definitely a man, because no woman would fuck the universe up this badly"
33,So goat’s a gender now?
34,Baphomet was originally a corruption of Mohammed i think.  Its like some misinformation from the crusades time or something that people have really run away with
35,"Yeah I thought God had no sex/gender since no body. They always call him ""He"" though."
36,"Isn’t god’s gender ambiguous in Judaism?, you know the first half of Judeo-Christian?"
37,Wait a minute didn't the Knight's Templar worship this thing
38,Lol wut? Angels don't have gender.
39,Aren't *actual/true* Satanists much more tolerant than Christians etc.?
40,"God has special pronouns - He/Him. Don't you dare misgender Him by not capitalizing his pronouns!

And don't you dare deadname Him by calling Him YHWH - that's just not cool."
41,Satanists don’t indoctrinate any children. Their parents use religion to make their children’s lives miserable. They abuse and abandon them when they they decide they don’t want to be a part of their parents religion anymore. So when they get older they go themselves to other religions after getting sick of how they were treated. Then their parents blame satanists for taking their kids away when it was their own actions that forced them away.
42,Whoever made this has never “realized” anything lol
43,DONT YOU DARE CLAIM GOD DOESNT HAVE A CHUBBY PENIS! /s
44,This is so ignorant I can't even dignify it with a response.
45,Wrong! Everyone knows god is a white man with a long beard sitting on a golden throne
46,"For Satan's sake, please learn how to crop!"
47,A buff dude with titties?????🥵🥵🥵
48,"That Satan has two snakes for a dick, as well as a huge shaft. Where do I prostrate?"
49,That isnt satan that is baphomet... its depicted as female and male.
50,"They'll get triggered when you say God is non binary and cry that he's male. 

Okay, does he have a dick?🧐

If so, why?🤔"
51,So you can just draw tits on Baphonet and suddenly it’s transgendered? Can I draw tits on Jesus and say the same thing?
52,Once you realize that magical thinking is ridiculous you find out that caring about what other people do (as long as it hurting anyone) is ridiculous.
53,"Atheist believe in no gods and the modern satanist doesn’t either. Also who said that Satan is transgender, I’ve never heard that before"
54,satan is trans?
55,"They even have a deiity thats trans bodily form. Its a suicidal guy, a ambiguous humannoid, and an immeterial spirit."
56,Why wasn't the size of Jesus's dick recorded in scripture? They talked about a donkey's dick but not the son of god? It's obvious the Romans weren't impressed.
57,They basically do think any religion besides theirs is a product of Satan and this isn't even Satan either it's Baphomet.
58,Certain sections of the right believe everyone not a right wing religious extremist is literally worshiping Satan and trying to hide it from them.
59,"My old girl is a go-to-church-every-Sunday kinda Christian. When I was home last, I found a Anglican Christian pamphlet. I thought to myself, well this will make an interesting read.

I shit you not, one of the first lines was ""the high priest of science, Richard Dawkins, have atheist believe"" XYZ.

It was very eye opening. For one, the fact some Christians can't comprehend that atheists don't require the mindless following of doctrine, blew me away. Second, that they view science as a belief system and not based on fact, was also very strange."
60,">BWAHAHAHAHA!  They think we have a ""God!""

SNICKER SNICKER! They think *they* have a ""God!"""
61,"aight, just gonna say your profile picture is amazing"
62,"Baphomet is said to originate from a mishearing of ""Muhammad"" (muhammad -> mohamed -> Mahomet -> baphomet) of islam. Christians heard other sects were idolising this guy and thought they were worshipping a heretical demon. They weren't far off in their assessment, I guess."
63,"Ya know, that explains soooooo much!"
64,That’s why Christianity is so popular in the South!
65,"Thank you. Satanists use these symbols as a rebellion towards the christian religion or anything thought to be holy. The inverted cross as well that became dug up on the internet by someone and found out about a supposed story that it represented st.peter pan. Supposedly he asked to be crucified upside down since he wasn't a good as jésus. What people who claim this don't know is that the roman emperor  nero was the one who killed st. Peter, and the upside down thing was just another one of his torture methods which he did to many other christians in different ways, as a mockery of the crucifixion as well. Even the symbol of nero is an inverted cross with broken arms all these things were done before the crucifix was even being used often in those times. Besides all that the inverted cross is used as a symbol against religion in general. 

As for baphomet becoming the bimbo winged goat which has always caughty eye since I was a kid and not in weird way. Baphomet was drawn by the french occultist elphias levi it's meaning is the balance between all things being equal. Later baphomet would be used by satanists or people into the occult or dark subjects.

Tldr: Use of satanic symbols and some meanings behind them. Some baphomet info."
66,I mean this is a common belief that God is male but I don't really think the Bible specifies a gender for God either.
67,"One of the perfect teachings I grew up with in Catholic school was, that I would have to take care to not make my own jams on my day of the month when I am impure, as the jam would turn bad, because of that.
So I guessed God could only be a man, I woman would not sell this b..s..
This 
Good thing is: Now as a grown up I never make my own jams anyhow...I am a bad girl"
68,"Yes I attended a sermon where the pastor broke down the Jewish word for God and explained how it had part masculine and part feminine indicators. It was a Methodist church with a female pastor if I remember correctly, maybe ten years ago."
69,"I have a few religious friends. Some people believe God is a woman and some believe male depending on the traditions. 

In the Bible itself, lore wise/story wise, God is sometimes an “it” or switches gender. This is due to the entity being able to shapeshift. God can be a ball of fire, god can be a girl, god can be a man, or even a bird, or bush. The concept being that literally anyone or anything could be God in disguise and to treat objects, animals, and people kindly because it could be God in disguise. I guess that would make the Christian God a “transformer, deity in disguise”. I’ll walk myself out."
70,"He made Adam 1.0 in his image and then removed a rib, creating Adam 2.0 and Eve 1.0. Therefore, Adam 1.0 is the combination of man and woman perhaps hermaphrodite, trans, or non binary. Because Adam 1.0 is the image of god, god is also hermaphrodite/trans/non-binary. 

Almost got beat up at church camp for this argument."
71,"Yeah, but outside the Ten Commandments (in theory), the Bible was written by humans who were known to be pretty fucking sexist (among several other -isms) - can you *really* trust them to get it right?"
72,"Of course their god is male!! He was created by men to give men power over women. 

Read ""When God Was a Woman"" by Merlin Stone."
73,I dunno... It kinda burns...
74,"Lesson in Christian demonology: That's not Satan, it's a guy named Baphomed"
75,"Also: ya, let's focus on the gender and ignore the fkn GOAT HEAD!"
76,In hebrew gods name is often yahweh as well which is a combination of the feminine yah and masculine weh which would indicate god being enby
77,"Caveat: Hebrew is a gendered language, so all nouns have a gender not inherently related to their nature.  In Hebrew, male is the default/superseding gender (i.e. a group of men and women is referred to with a male collective noun).  El just means “god” and is not a personal name; Asherah is a name of a female ancient Canaanite deity sometimes associated with YHWH."
78,"Hebrew doesn't have any gender neutral words, so everything has to be either male or female."
79,Asherah was Yahweh's wife…
80,Loki did something similar except he ended up pregnant. Lulz.
81,Oh no not at all. OT angels were definitely banging human women pre-flood.
82,Nah - child molesters aren't into big tiddies.
83,"Gods enby, they have gremlin energy and love watching the world burn"
84,Neither do spirits and YHWH is the ultimate spiritual being.
85,"I've often heard ""Godless heathen,"" so having a god now is actually a step up."
86,"Baphomet got rid of a bible-thumping roomie when I was in the Army. My former room mate had left the military, so they moved this bug-eyed, jumped up southern bible thumper into my mod.

BUT! I had a poster of Baphomet I'd bought and let's say she was less than happy about it. She whined to the company sergeant, and they moved her out of my life.

Hail Baphomet!"
87,Fun fact: The modern representation of Baphomet comes from a twist made on the Templars' view on god to frame them as Heretics
88,"I'm a Godless heathen so pardon my ignorance...

What's the difference between Satan and Baphomet?"
89,"Let's all stop hiding it then, and become legitimate card-carrying members of *[The Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/)*, eh?  I'd think that should ease their qualms, no?"
90,It’s not mine. I just found it on r/persona5
91,What do you think of mine?
92,"Jews, Christians and Muslims *all* worship the God of Abraham. Yahweh and Allah are the exact same deity--""Allah"" is simply Arabic for ""the One true God"".

Also, Satan is one of God's creations, a ""fallen angel"". Any Christian who claims Satan is a ""god"" should read the Bible much better. There are several gods named in that book of horrible fairy tales without them elevating more to that status."
93,Sweet home Allahbama!
94,😂🤣😂
95,"It is also a common belief that Jesus was an homophobic Texas white supremacist, but the Bible does actually say the opposite"
96,"""the father, the son and the holey moley ghost."""
97,"I remember a PragerU video on the matter talking about ""God"" being depicted in the masculine, presumably in the sense that it does not have a gender nor sex."
98,"I grew up hearing that Adam was made in ""his"" image and that Eve was basically a byproduct of Adam, so not an image of god, but rather ""custom built"" for Adam (from his rib). 

Honestly idk the sect, my parents church hopped from Methodist to other sects... And only after I came out and educated them did they stop attending church (some were ""too conservative"" and others ""too liberal""). 

It's a trip."
99,"my comment was mostly about how religion is practiced. i believe that a LOT of organized religion is powerful men making rules to keep themselves on top, especially above women. so “god is a man, i am a man, i am your god” is how it’s implemented in so many ways and places. being punished for having periods, being basically sold from father to husband, not being allowed to teach. even if those rules have been watered down as time goes on, it’s still there. 

i mean, who trusts anyone else to write a book of god’s words and not add personal opinions. 

i’m obv not a biblical scholar though, and know very little about the origins and literal interpretations, much less the cultural influences of certain terms. the replies to my comment are rly interesting."
100,I mean god uses He/Him
