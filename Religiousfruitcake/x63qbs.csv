1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Ok, so I had literally never heard of this, and while I was looking at this post an ad for it came on my TV.  I'm taking it as a sign from God that I should watch the show."
2,The show has Danny DeVito voicing Old Scratch. That alone elevates it to Must See TV.
3,It seems like Disney started to see Christianity as a joke.
4,"Why is everything a ""war"" to the-oh wait."
5,The problem we have here is that conservatives don't actually understand the media they consume and just associate all cartoons with Disney Because they don't understand that different studios exist and are made by a horde of teams of talented artists and writers. They literally seem to think it's one guy sitting there drawing things at the Disney studio with the agenda to make thier kids gay and liberal. Oh and teach them science and reasoning because it's against their precious religion.
6,"I wouldn't say a joke, lots of what used to be religions have been turned into entertainment over the years and seems like the same thing will happen eventually"
