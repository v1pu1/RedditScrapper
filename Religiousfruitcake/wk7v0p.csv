1,This guy wants polygamous marriage? How many women does he want to disappoint at a time?
2,When CHIVALRY is too liberal for you... there is a good possibility you are an extremist weirdo.
3,"""What do you mean I need to treat women as people?"""
4,When even the Middle Ages are too feminist for you ...
5,"The woman must agree to marry...you cant buy a wife...you cant rape your wife...you cant beat your wife....you dont own your wife. If you think any one of these points is a problem you're a piece of shit. To go on th internet and whine about all 5 points, well lets just say thats why you aren't having much sex."
6,They just described a slave. They want a slave
7,Ah jeez i thought this was satire. Poe's law strikes again
8,Man these people are so gross and there‚Äôs so many of them
9,It‚Äôs a religion of rape.
10,This is beyond vile
11,"Dude this account is horrifying. 

I went to look at the Instagram account because I couldn‚Äôt believe this was real."
12,Religious leaders are lucky they're still able to con people today.
13,Why do I feel that this guy supports polygamy under the assumption that HE will be the one marrying multiple women rather than remain single?
14,It‚Äôs all about controlling women and has been for millennia.
15,"Ah yes, Christians once again protesting against equal rights"
16,"This shit reads like patch notes.

 ""Fixed an issue that caused patriarchy to crash.""

""Fixed bug that caused (my) property (woman) to seek free.    will."""
17,"I was always told the Bible made it clear that God said one man and one woman? So, what's this man wanting polygamy for?"
18,![gif](giphy|GVDixAgxYEFXmbofOU|downsized)
19,"Shoot up until the 1980s, an adult woman had to have a man give her permission for a credit card.   That is where all this stuff sprung from with inherent sexism."
20,"Healthy loving relationship is awesome, this guy is missing out."
21,This psycho just wants an excuse to abuse their partner.
22,I understand some SOB men being religious (for the 'benefits' you can see on the post) but how can any woman choose to be a part of something like Christianity or Islam? Either they have no self-respect or they are just mindless masochists.
23,"I got a solution for you, dude. Just buy a six-pack of inflatable dolls. They don‚Äôt talk back, you have several of them, you can punch or kick them all you want since they‚Äôre rubber, and best of all, you leave actual flesh and blood women alone. Perfect!"
24,"1. You have to be romantically attracted to your wife

2. Your wife has to be romantically attracted back and give consent to marry

3. Don't rape your wife

4. Don't beat your wife

5. Don't be a controlling douchebag

Idk man those sound like pretty good rules to me"
25,I bet he‚Äôs great at parties‚Ä¶.. if he were invited to any
26,"Wow, it's almost like Biblical morals were written by a Bronze Age cult of genocidal barbarians."
27,"So this guy wants to abuse and rape his multiple wives while his wives have absolutely no power in the relationship... 

Yeah, I wonder why this stuff isn't popular anymore.."
28,So he is basically admitting no-one would like him unless they were forced to.
29,Please take this upvote in lieu of an angry react
30,WHAT?! WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED LIKE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS?! OUTRAGEOUS! /s
31,"Oh this guy? No he absolutely advocates for CDD (Christian Domestic Discipline) which is spanking your wife when they ""act out"""
32,[deleted]
33,#5 says it all. They want to control everything. That's the end goal of cults. Control.
34,I guess chivalry really is dead
35,"Ugh, mormons."
36,"If the amount of men to women ratio is about 50/50, the how would every man have multiple wives work out?"

39,What u mean we can beat our wife? What the hell we supposed to do when she burns the biscuits

41,"I mean, it's all technically true, although I would have used the word ""improve"" instead of ""corrupt"", and it's very disturbing that these improvements upset him."
42,"He should move to the Middle East, he‚Äôd love it there"
43,"Ah yes, Christianity the religion of love"
44,So what this guy wants is a bunch of slaves...
45,oh no we can‚Äôt rape women!!
46,When the Bible isn't biblical enough for you.
47,Is this dude upset with 14th century ideals?
48,"Why do these men need to have power over their wives (or anyone else for that matter) at all???  Are they that insecure that they need to feel powerful and in control of another fully functioning, sentient adult?  It's so gross.  Marriage is a partnership!"
49,"Does this person feel love or even desire it at all? That's a dark place to be. He's no better than a pack animal in this regard.

No offense to pack animals"
50,"Honestly, I want polygamy back, but that‚Äôs just for my right as a dude to have a marriage with multiple dudes."
51,"Please be satire, please be satire."
52,"Ah yes. Yet another example of someone claiming to be a Christian,  yet ignoring actual new testament words of Jesus himself,  in favour of using OT as an excuse to exercise his own warped proclivities."
53,Is He trying to criticize the bible here?
54,I saw this account. They support Trump and they implicitly support rape lmao
55,This guy wants to use the Bible to beat his wife(wives) into submission.
56,"So if I could convince you that the Bible actually says the roles get reversed, you'd be okay with that, huh?"
57,Because everyone wants to live in the world of the Old Testament Bible. /s
58,"This is a very elaborate way to come to terms with having a micropenis. Therapy seems easier, honestly."
59,From #3 it sounds like he wants several women to rape.
60,Sounds like he wants a big group of non-confrontational wives to rape and beat the shit out of every day like some Royal Rumble from the stone age
61,Two wives. Evidently. He has only two fists. Wait! He has feet too!
62,[deleted]
63,Does he seriously imagine that humanity might join him in backtracking its values all the way through the 13th century? We'll be busy traveling the galaxy in cyborg bodies first.
64,god forbid
65,He wants to live in bronze age Judea it seems
66,You can't buy a wife?  What am I going to do with these six goats now?

68,He just wants to live in the middle east it seems.
69,"This day and age I begin by approaching everything on the internet as satire, and then see if it proves otherwise."
70,I decided to pay their instagram acc a visit and wow that was one of the top 10 greatest mistakes I've done ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
71,Given his other points.. the women wouldn't have a *choice*. Silly earthen vessels don't have a say in who owns them.
72,"Fixed an issue where brain was showing signs of working, it has been disabled now."
73,"Must be looking up to Solomon lol. I also believe ancient Jews were monogamous, most of antique world was. Harems, concubines, mistresses and sex slave girls were mostly a royal privilege back then"
74,Lot and his daughters?
75,Brainwashing is a powerful tool.
76,They are raised into it. Grooming from the start
77,Conan the barbarian was nicer than this üòÇ
78,"I tried to read it but it's so gross. Like they must be under 25 or else the grooming won't work ü§¢ü§Æ.  So gross, like most brains don't even finish developing until 25."
79,You'd think so but he doesn't like brown people either
80,This. It's really fucking creepy and I hope his wife is okay.
81,"If this dickhead doesn't want to be insulted, he should treat other people better."
82,"Lets insult people for a reason, like wanting to rape and abuse multiple woman"
83,"Well, amount of muslims is growing, so.."
84,True
85,Well....they're your best shot at having sex.
86,Nothing says you have to marry them.
