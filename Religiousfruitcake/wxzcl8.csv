1,I'm sorry but it being in Comic Sans is absolutely sending me lmao.
2,If God is on this guy's side he would have kept him from using ComicSans.
3,I wonder how many people in this country agree with this 100%
4,So confused why they mention genesis 1 and the possible spam of time in between. Doesnâ€™t this seem to imply that the Earth can be millions of years old? That seems a bit open-minded for someone *this* Bible obsessed.
5,How are you supposed to help these people.
6,This dude abides......and is batshit crazy.........
7,THIS BITCH IS REFERRING OTHERS TO COPELAND ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
8,"Yahweh is up there pissed as fuck because Christians worship his son and not him.

Way to go Christians. Showing the world that you believe in 2 separate Gods.


But but the Trinity. No. You are worshipping another god. Calling someone a god who historically would be offended by it.


Way to go"

12,Probably at least 10% of the population.
13,1 is too many for my taste.
