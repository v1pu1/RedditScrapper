2,I really hope this guy is forever single and doesn't get a chance to kidnap or rape anyone either.
3,ü§î What's the Hindu equivalent of jEsUs Is LoVe¬° / iSlAm Is ThE rElIgIoN oF pEaCe?
4,My brain is just having a hard time processing that this ain't satire
5,Yo it's kinda similar to islamic ideology

7,"Amazing that they think, ‚ÄúWe should publicly shame women, *any and all women*, just to scare them off ‚Äòbeing who*es‚Äô‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI‚Äôve aired an absolutely despicable opinion in public and I alone should be shamed for it.‚Äù

The absolutely wild lengths a dude will go to get their dick wet and have control over another human being, it‚Äôs like half the foundation of their entire religion lmao"
8,"Wow
Wow
WOW"
9,rape culture as a religious belief.  surely that is what hell was made for.
10,"I remember at one point where I did prefer the idea of wanting to go to an all-boys school but my dad was on the side of those types of schools will turn you gay.

I did eventually find out that all-boys schools were basically religious private schools and then that's what made me say nope."
11,I hate muslim men going after nonmuslim girls but would want better laws for handling that not a brutal sharia shit of hindu version. Since I know culture and practices are distinct most don't make proper match unless it's the elites or both have lived in close neighbourhood and have childhood family bonds. Else newbie romance is hell of disaster. Muslim boys tend to date nonmuslim women just for sex atleast a disproportionately high no. Does.. religious fruitcake is on reverse too. But still it's on onus of hindu girl choice what she wants to do in secular country. She can be in misery with a idiot h guy too.
12,*Maidenless?*
13,Funny how it‚Äôs only the girl being victimised here
14,It‚Äôs India. So would probably get a marriage arranged for him while still being such a degenerate.
15,"All the world is our family. 

-The Hindu equivalent to your above statements."
16,"I mean, all extremist religious interpretations are the same. Women are just a means to reproduce the next generation of their lunatics."
17,"""Where are my sex slaves and 11 wives? I want to have sex with them in one night without taking a bath between each one of them"" - Mohammed"
18,"The bottom line says: if she wants to marry you, she wants you to have a 6 digit salary, house, car and you need to be under 30

The top line: bit unsure but part of it says ‚Äúready in 2 seconds‚Äù"
19,I'm gonna need you to raise both arms above your head for me
20,Double negative tarnished
21,"And he'll probably verbally abuse that woman and call her a whore whenever she makes the slightest mistake serving him or doing housework, or does a single thing that isn't in his service."
22,"Thankx!


aLl ThE wOrLd Is OuR fAmIlY"
23,Really their ass get burn when women are exceeding In life
24,When you realise one of his ‚Äúwives‚Äù is a childü§¢

mission is on guys"
26,Say me whatever I have seen victims Live in my city it's isn't good. British grooming gangs were predominantly muslims. I am not against love but Islam doesn't align with other faiths. Exmuslim is better choice and you know it if it's your daughter or sister even if you're Atheist who hates all religions. I am agnostic but I will feel opresssed in islamic regime than a Christian or hindu one being a woman if i was one.
27,"Thx, fixed it."
28,I really doubt it‚Äôs gonna be just verbal
29,"I wasn't disagreeing, I was jokingly implying you were having a stroke because of how you're typing"
30,"True. I guess I added the word verbal because everything he described ""shame them"" ""call them a whore"" was verbal, but considering the attitude it seems like every other form of abuse are pretty likely."
31,No problem it's fine. I generally searched and have collected lot of news of these cases hence I am sensitive. Right-wing keeps making political statement but generalise all muslim men as bad which shouldn't be . But have seen a lot in left in west to just ignore this phenomenon in India which will plague the whole west where new muslim migrants are settled and rising. It's very easy to label anyone as Islamophobic just because facts aren't from alzazeera or CNN.
