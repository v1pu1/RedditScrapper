1,iSlAm Is ThE rElIgIoN oF pEaCe
2,So he's threatening that muslim men have a tendency to be hysterical to the point of violence if you hurt their little fee fees? Maybe they should stay at home and not be so emotional and hormonal.
3,If you're so fragile that you have to murder someone because you got your feelings hurt I don't know how you've made it in society
4,I would bet my house that these commenters have never read a book by Salman Rushdie in their lives.  They have no idea what he wrote and are totally relying on distorted second hand information.   The fact that people are willing to kill a human being based on hearsay speaks to their sick mentality.
5,"""he gets what he deserves [loss of an eye, perhaps permanent loss of speech, an attempt on his life]. Don't make fun of others.""

Bruh most people learn in Pre-K that you're not supposed to try to KILL someone for making fun of you."
6,"If movies like Noah' Life of Brian and invention of lying used any kind of islamology, they would be angry and throwing their fists cause saw their religion in danger :/ and relate it to people taking rights away from them :/"
7,How fragile is your religion if it can‚Äôt stand up against Mockery
8,"Jesus fuck I hate religion. Fuck your muhammad, pedophile as bitch"
9,Bunch of idiots who can't integrate to a secular state and can't take any criticism to their religion due to lack of understanding of freedom of speech.
10,I sometimes wonder how these morons even manage to tie their own shoelaces in the morning.
11,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make fun of others‚Äù *praising an attempted murder*
12,Nah fuck you nadeem I will make fun of others
13,"""Don't make fun of others, that is not good.""

Then...

""So anyway thanks fuck that blasphemer got knifed!"""
14,"This is why the PC culture of never criticize Islam is so dangerous. 

People need to stop calling everyone racist when it's bad ideas that are being criticized."
15,"All religions create hate and violence.
Atheists don't"
16,Seems like Nadeem is making fun of Salman. Certainly violence against Nadeem wouldn‚Äôt be justified?
17,"So ""make fun of"" justifies murder. How loving and peaceful."
18,"Finally someone who doesn't spread hate, mocks others' faith and ignores their opinion stepped up LMFAO"
19,It doesn't appear he was traveling with any security.
20,That‚Äôs considered by far a very mild mooslim already.
21,"Go fuck a pig, Nadeem."
22,You'd have to be straight up inbred for at least 10 generations to have read the Satanic Verses and interpreted it as making fun of Muhammad
23,And they wonder why Islamophobia existsüòê
24,What about don't kill others? Seems like that's more important.
25,"Use their logic and tell them that gay people deserve to EXIST, women deserve to go out and they‚Äôll throw a tantrum"
26,"""Don't make fun other others"" that is rich coming from a religion that wants to kill literally anyone and everyone not of the religion."
27,Any belief system that cannot withstand mockery obviously has a very weak foundation.
28,Don‚Äôt you just love the religion of peace?!
29,"yeah tell that to the people in the WTC towers on 9/11. Oh, wait. They didn't make fun of others."
30,I'm out of the loop what happened?
31,"So, don't make fun of others but stabing is ok?"
32,Reading comprehension isn't strong among Islamists these days. The book doesn't even do that
33,Look who's spreading hate now.
34,"This is what made me left. Islam preaches peace but the moment someone step out of line, its the harshest punishment given.

Mock the prophet? Death.

Sex outside of marriage? 100 lashes for the man and stoning to death for the women.

Leave Islam? Death.

Disrespect the Quran? Death.

Your wife doesn't want to have sex with you? Just beat her with a stick. But not the face tho, everywhere else is free game. 

Every single punishment is death or some sort of abuse."
35,"I guess u can tell those idiots ""if he is still alive then that means alah wants it so, leave him alone or your would be violating alas will"" or something like that"
36,"Every time I hear this is like hearing beaten people say that abusive people love them... We swear we're about peace but watch your ass around us or we'll straight up saw your head off with a knife for the camera... But only some of us, I'm a good one... Husband actually beats me because he loves me, not like those other wives.  It's so obviously an abusive and violent religion(like many of them, I'll go at all of them for all I care) and I just feel bad that the followers are too scared to leave. Scared of God, demons, hell, being murdered, being tortured and brainwashed then murdered is good too... The lies we tell ourselves to forgive those who hurt us are truly mind bending. I am glad some of you are even keeled people trying to prove Islam can be peaceful and kind but unfortunately others are using you as a meat shield. Can't talk bad about Islam because you have one coworker who believes and isn't an ass about it... That peaceful Muslim shields Islam and it's sins... Just like the Christians who swear they are being oppressed despite regularly just doing what they want and laughing at the laws. I am sorry but I'm angry people are using an idea to hurt others. Gods are a theory about how the universe functions, an unproved one... So the theory of gods is why were killing each other... You're all people! Deal with it! No one of you is made better than the other and none of you are individually special enough to matter. Please, whatever gods you believe in, keep it private and be kind to others. I just want it known, I don't want any more death... I'm tired of people being deleted over nothing... You're all special and when you die you will be a memory... Please try to be the memory everyone wants to talk about and smile over. Don't be a memory tainted by hate... We have enough of those."
37,peace is a euphemism for idiots who can't think rationally.
38,Plenty of dangerous nuts in Christianity too. Don‚Äôt they kill doctors?
39,Yh honestlyI loathe all religions as they are all bad to an extent but Islam seems to bring about unmatched suffering and barbarism.
40,"And at the same time, a glimpse of ankle with drive them to rape.  Like a dog when it encounters a bitch in heat."
41,Hey this is the same people who Force women to conceal all but 2 inches of their skin because they're incapable of not being sexually tempted
42,"Well, their culture is so male-centric their mothers and sisters (have to) keep babying them all their life.

The result is full grown toddlers who break things when they don't get their will through."
43,These are the same people that attacked Paris over a drawing. They don‚Äôt read anything other than their hateful book because it is haram. They don‚Äôt have reason.
44,"At the time, Life of Brian did cause quite an uproar, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something on YT if you can be arsed."
45,The Quran is incompatible with many ideals found in modern society.
46,"Small correction: All religions create hate and violence, *atheism* don't.

Plenty of violent atheists, but they're not violent because of their atheism, or because atheism demand violence."
47,"Atheist here, I don‚Äôt know if I necessarily agree with that. There have been atheist communist regimes that have killed a lot of people throughout history."
48,That's ridiculous. Don't replace one dogma with another. The USSR was aggressively atheistic (not just secular) and they committed crimes against humanity.
49,"yup, stalin and mao. Two of the greatest people!"
50,Tell that to Nazi Germany
51,Peace is an euphemism for submission.
52,Pizza to the death!
53,"You can apply this for any religion, law or rule. Try not paying your taxes and see how the state treats you."
54,"Have yet to see any novelist or thinker who criticizing Christianity getting stabbed or killed. But you are right that dangerous nuts can be in all religions and many people in this subreddit know that. 

Just wait until Christianity do some shit and the comment section will overwhelmingly condemning them. This post is about Islam so you will see ‚ÄúThe religion of peace‚Äù phase a lot."
55,Don't forget that prepubescent boys without beards make them so horny they can't even work out in the same gym. These people are animals...
56,That makes a lot of sense. Good point.
57,Yeah but no one got stabbed in the neck over it.
58,basic human rights actually
59,The Quran is incompatible with itself
60,Atheism **doesn't**.
61,I don't even believe they themselves were atheist but had to force atheism on people so they'd only listen to them.
62,"Still not a primary motivator. Mostly it was people under an illusion that worker class ruled USSR and should rule over the world, aka communism. When it was just a few powerhungry dictators at the top who held all the power.

They may or may not have been truly atheist. But they didn't commit atrocities just because of atheism."
63,"At least atheists don't kill because their ""god"" told them to."
64,Under what tenets of atheism did they commit such crimes?
65,They don't count smart one.
66,Nazis were basically christian extremists though.
67,"Hitler and his ilk were Christian. They even had ""Gott Mit Uns"" on their belts, which means ""God is with us."""
68,"Pretty sure tax evasion isn't going to get you literally killed, but ok buddy."
69,"If you don't wanna pay taxes then stop using infrastructure and facilities created by society which enables you to earn the taxable income.

Go and live in the jungles or mountains, no one will tax u there."
70,Does a country wants you dead if you leave?
71,"They have KILLED doctors. 

That same phrase should be use for all dumbass religions"
72,"Talked to a woman from predominantly muslim country once. She was very surprised that I, a male, moved out at the age of 16 and been doing household chores by myself for the most of my life.

Her siblings are pushing 40 and still living under their mother's hem - even sisters have to serve their male siblings.

And from what I've gathered, this pretty widespread and common in the muslim world."
73,"Yep you‚Äôre right, there was a lot of frothing at the mouth and all from old biddies who‚Äôre less able to attack though"
74,That would be too much for a small correction...
75,Doesn't make a difference if you're the one being killed.
76,"Under the will to bring about (by force, ie impose) a uniform doctrine across the whole territory. Much like theocracies do, but in reverse. Any spiritual doctrine can be used for authoritarian purposes - and that includes atheism. Sorry.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR_anti-religious_campaign_(1928%E2%80%931941)"
77,pol pot was also an athiest. Athiesm breeds evil then right?
78,Well that's extremely convenient.
79,When it builds to you either being on the street or in prison. There is a high chance of death.
80,"Please don‚Äôt give the government ideas, I haven‚Äôt paid my tv license in two years and they can‚Äôt do a thing‚Ä¶ yet"
81,"Exactly my point. Don't wanna pay tax, then go to the jungle and DIE"
82,"I will save your feeling and said it in the post about Christianity fruitcake that ‚Äúbut what about Islam, you should condemn all religions‚Äù then. See how the public will love it."
83,"Than you think they would appreciate and love their women more. Ya know, the ones doing everything."
84,Well atheists don't is proper.  And atheism doesn't is also correct.  You didn't fix.
85,"Yes, but it is one less reason to kill.  Every murder - the ones done because of religion = fewer murders."
86,"That's authoritarianism, not atheism. Try again."
87,"Yep, that's the nr.1 rule in the Rulebook of Atheism.

1. Must be evil.
2. Must hate GOD.
3. Have avocado once a week.
4. ...


Oh, wait a minute. We have no rulebook!"
88,"Again not the same reason for people turning to atheism. I worship pol pot, stalin, mao, and hitler because I'm atheist? Wtf."
89,Hmm.
90,Are you hearing yourself? Ffs you need a reality check my Guy
91,No it's not exactly your point you dolt
92,"Hypocrisy.

If no one will pay tax then how will the whole country survive? All the infrastructure, public transport, public healthcare, police, military, sanitation etc, who will pay for it?

You want benefits of living in a city but not contribute to it's welfare? Or you want others to pay on your behalf?"
93,"They treat them like slaves... no, they are slaves to them."
94,where did i say u worship them? What I‚Äôm saying is atheist regimes are notorious for their genocides and killing of intellectuals.
95,"He really does. Last I checked, you don't get punished with death for simply leaving most countries."
96,Take it easy princess lol. No need getting angry.
97,Your practically saying that atheists are  in the same category as brutal dictators.
98,"So are all other regimes.   
Almost like it's the ""regime""  part that's the problem."
99,Nor for leaving most religions
100,Not angry. But thank you for using my proper title I can tell you get confused easily so it's good that you were able to put it in there
