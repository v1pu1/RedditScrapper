1,Taking advantage of someone so vulnerable. Fuck this piece of shit
2,drugs did more for me than jeebus ever did
3,Why is the Venn diagram of fruitcakes and people that can't grasp punctuation always a circle?
4,"Based on her post history, she spams this same B.S anywhere to those looking for REAL help. What an ass-rag."
5,"Always with this half-understood, pseudo-theological agape love shit that they heard third-hand from some pastor’s plagiarized sermon.  No explanation has been given that the speaker is talking about a Greek word for love here, just repeating shit that s/he heard and regurgitating it.  No evidence is offered as to how anyone could know any of this nor how, tangibly, a zombie carpenter is going to fix all the suicides for them with his, as far as anyone else knows since we all assume we are speaking English here, gaping.  Also don’t worry if this makes your feel better, s/he explains, because, basically, believing in it won’t change anything at all “in this life” but the peace is, like, deep within.  So, trust me, but don’t expect to feel anything, that’s after you die I totes promise."
6,What a gross and manipulative human being.
7,A predator preying on vulnerable people. The beatitudes comes to mind.
8,"That's not even what agape means. 

Also, Jesus is a heart surgeon now? I don't trust his qualifications. Guy spit on people and didn't wash his hands before eating."
9,Fuck people like this. Lost both my parents by the time I was 8 and lost my mom (the woman who took care of us after) when I was 23. Now I have no parents and even though I am married with two kids I still feel alone. Where the fuck was “Jesus” when my biological mother was in the room dying of cancer with her young kids sleeping in the next room? Where the fuck was “Jesus” when my father died of a heart attack in front of me in the kitchen? Where the fuck was “Jesus” when my mom laid dying in the hospital bed? Tired of this shit good things don’t just happen because you believe in this crap.
10,"A quote from one of my fav history channels about the plague

“Oh no, it appears that you have contracted big ded. You should pray about it or something”"
11,"Even if you could prove Jesus existed, you have no idea if he even gives a fuck about you. There's literally a contradiction in the Bible about this;"
12,I mean Jesus committed suicide by cop basically.
13,I hope that's -16 and not +16 on the upvote counter
14,"Oh look, it's me! Mom I'm famous"
15,"""Jesus should be the answer"" is the reason I never went to my parents for help. And the reason why if I ever get over the damage that was done and have kids, they will know that this is nonsense and they can always talk to me and we will find the solutions."
16,"If you convinced yourself that the Keebler elves ran an eternal paradise with an army of Dumbo the Elephants as angels, you could make yourself feel loved by them if you imagined hard enough."
17,No thanks. Religion directly contributed to my suicidal thoughts when I was younger.
18,"For all the things god gives and teaches you apparently the gift of fucking punctuation isn’t one of them lmao

Also 

>it’s gods love called agape

Its. Called. Fucking. **What?**

God can stay very far away from my gapes than you very much."
19,"Oh dear, this is disgusting.  I can understand religion being an individuals helpmate in dealing with depression, but not as a whole damn crutch and certainly not as something to shove on other people."
20,"“Jeebus is the answer, he can save you”

*suicide rate drops to 0%*"
21,"Jesus Christ was supposed to return within that generation. He's the ultimate absent Dad who ran out for cigarettes 2,000 years ago and never came back. Maybe they could get the hint already?"
22,"I have no words. I actually tried to kill myself two times, and this asshole us taking about this bullshit."
23,"If Jesus were real, let’s look at this realistically , the guy got overtaken by his captors and killed by them, just like suicide victims do with their brain chemistry."
24,"The ultimate hypocrisy of religion: It latches itself to the supposed ""fleeting"" reality to survive, yet in the same breath, denounces said reality as ""illusionary"" and ""fleeting""."
25,"Holy run-on sentence, Batman!"
26,nothing makes my blood boil quite like people bothering or messing with those who contemplate/deal with suicide.
27,"They failed, Jesus can't come into my life that easy"
28,Yes thats one of ways they can spread. They dont care about the persons wellbeing...
29,And they continue to aid me to this day 👏🏽
30,"They don't really think about what they're saying or typing, because otherwise they'd realize how idiotic they sound."
31,"Religion typically attracts and preys on people with less education. It is easier to convert someone who doesn’t think much for themselves. That’s why they need religion. It tells them what to do, how to act, etc."
32,tbf punctuation is hard. But not as hard as this person makes it look...
33,"thanks, gonna block her in advance."
34,Not to mention their god doesn't know what the fuck agape is. You cannot have conditions on love. That's not how love works.
35,"I concur. Having been raised far from any religion, served in the military for 5 years, employed by the DOD/DON for 25 years, had to medically retire. I was so depressed, over medicated, no support from my husband, he was pissed because he had to work and I just stayed home, blah, blah, blah. I fell for/into the jesus cult. I am an avid reader. As I read/studied the storybook it became obvious what it really is about. I am much happier and freer without it."
36,Jesus: 1st century Slender Man.
37,What was the quote?
38,That’s a ⬇️16 so they were panned.  Not as much as I’d like to see for prostilitizing their bullshit
39,"Jesus doesn’t give a fuck. He’s all “I own you, bitch”"
40,Bingo. These people are vulnerable and that makes for easier conversions.
41,"If you’re seriously taking drugs, I suggest you see a therapist. No offense."
42,Good for you. Glad you are out
43,"Literally if I was to choose someone to follow it would be buddha or Krishna, atleast they don't demand ownership."
44,"I mean, they could be referring to prescription meds, those help lots of people."
45,"I think you can tell by my name but I only use Mary Jane, no it’s not to cope just because I like to get high and I like to relax after a long day. Thanks tho x"
46,[deleted]
47,Thanks.
48,Yeah but I’m saying in case they’re like using drugs to cope instead of prescribed shit
49,No problem and don’t worry about the asshole below me. He’s butthurt cause I’m slightly concerned for a fellow human being.
50,"Bro. I was just saying in case they weren’t joking, don’t be an ass."
51,[deleted]
52,"Holy shit bro, I said *if*, can your pea brain read?"
53,[deleted]
54,"Idk man, you’re the one attacking me for saying “*just in case you’re not joking* I suggest you talk to a therapist” are you really that butthurt over me just being concerned for a human being. Average redditor I suppose."
55,[deleted]
56,"Ableist? For being concerned? Bruh what the fuck? I’m not even gonna argue anymore because your toxic ass is butthurt over me not getting a joke. Goddamn, touch grass and have a good day."
57,[deleted]
58,I never said they had a mental condition. You good?
59,[deleted]
60,WHERE THE FUCK DID I SAY THEY HAD A MENTAL CONDITION? LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE DAMN ASSHOLE. Are you proud of attacking a 16 year old because they didn’t get a joke? Are you happy? Do you feel like you accomplished something?
61,[deleted]
62,Wowwww. Lmao. Wow. I’m just…wow. I said if they’re using drugs to cope with certain things meaning like an addiction. I’m not talking about prescriptions. Bruh 💀
63,[deleted]
64,"Ah so insults now that you realize what I’m talking about? You are pathetic, instead of apologizing you’re too prideful to admit you’re wrong. I was talking about if they were using drugs as in using it to forget their problems even though it has bad side effects. Not PRESCRIPTIONS."
65,[deleted]
66,I’m done..god damn it I’m done..it’s impossible to come to an agreement with an ABSOLUTE FUCKING DUMBASS.
67,[deleted]
68,Go on..I’m sure you’re really enjoying tormenting me instead of explaining what you mean.
