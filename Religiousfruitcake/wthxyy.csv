1,"How are they married, but not married? Is it a Schroedinger's marriage?"
2,"Every time you hear about people with porn addiction, they‚Äôre religious. I can‚Äôt tell if they actually have a porn addiction or if any amount of porn is considered an addiction to these people."
3,"Oh I remember very clearly the mental anguish I went through when I was ""struggling with pornography"". Turns out after some growing up I realized it was just called being a fucking teenager."
4,Let the guy empty his balls

6,If you locked one of these psychos in an empty room they'd find 20 different things to raise a crusade against.
7,HE NEEDS TO GET LAID!
8,How to ruin a relationship over nothing. Poor kid
9,You have already boned. What the hell man
10,Fuck him
11,A blow job a day keeps the porn away
12,Crazy that the answer here is for her to fuck him. A lot.
13,Religious nutcase.
14,"A priest with a live in alter boy, who can‚Äôt have sex with a women in the next room.  The kids life is always going to be 5 seconds away from possible getting raped"
15,"If he has a genuine porn addiction, boning a real human isn't necessarily going to fix it."
16,"‚ÄúThank you for my son, god. No more porn for me‚Äù is the strangest line of logic I‚Äôve ever heard"
17,This is just pathetic at this point
18,"Thinking about porn after your son is born is really fucking weird. Like really weird. ""Hey my kid is born, guess I won't watch porn ever again!"" Yeah what.

This dude's religion is going to mess his brain up when it comes to his normal human sex drive. As a spouse, sorry, a ""spouse"", you should be able to understand that if you aren't having sex together then there are still sexual urges and that's ok. I understand some people consider porn cheating, but when a big angry overlord is behind it, it only leads to fear, shame, guilt, and anguish. Not sleeping in the same room even though you share a child is so outrageously dumb that I can't even address it. Poor them."
19,Wasn't god all knowing?
20," taking out the religious connotation, the woman is literally saying ""my husband has a porn addiction and i am uncomfortable as i feel it is cheating"". Looking at it that way, it really is a genuine problem. However, why is this suddenly an issue when they are so well in their relationship? Like that would be a major deal breaker, and not something i would overlook if i had that much of a problem with it ..."
21,I think the advice she needs is obvious. Dump the fruitcake religion.
22,"They are legally married, ie by the court or a civil celebrant. But they are not married in the church. 

Most churches the priest doubles as a legal celebrant so the marriage is legal in the eyes of the law and has the necessary spells to performed to make it approved by their god. Some christians thibk you're not properly married before god till you have the chrich wedding ao no sexy times for you. If you do it's a mortal sin and you will go to hell."
23,They're marriedn't
24,pretty sure it‚Äôs the latter
25,Loll right?? So he has a porn *_addiction_* or he watches poem like a couple times a week?
26,Exactly.  What kinda newlyweds are these two crazies.
27,"Then wuv, twoo wuv, will folllow forevah, so tweasuwe your wuv. Have you the wing? And do you, pwincess buwwercwup man and wife?"
28,He did. Once!
29,I like how the priest turns a blind eye to the fact so long as I doesn't happen again and they pretend that it never happened üòÇ
30,And I do mean this literally. FUCK.HIM
31,Then how does it work when pastors whobare allowed to marry and have sex with women also have creepy high rates of systemic child rape in their churches?
32,Five bucks says it's nowhere near an addiction lol
33,True but who knows what's actually going on with this guy. He could be an addict or he could just watch 'Big boobs handjob' every Tuesday and Friday and just that would be enough for it to be an issue for a Catholic.
34,"It‚Äôs interesting how when the wife is bringing her A-game in bed, the man becomes a very productive member of society with no time for porn. 

It‚Äôs like the answer is staring her in the face."
35,"She is pregnant

So unless it has happened *again*, they have had 'sexy times'

If it was me, having done the mortal sin thing, then just fucking go for broke. You can't go to hell twice, am I right? So just bang away, and then confess later and you are good to go"
36,"It's the same with Muslims, legal marriage doesn't mean marriage, they need a nikkah contract. In Muslim countries the court recognises the nikkah contract so you don't need two contracts, you just need to register the nikkah contract. 

In non Muslim countries, some Muslims do 2 contracts, the Islamic one and the court one. But many others only do the nikkah contract at the mosque or at home with the imam there, and don't bother with a legal marriage. This is also how some Muslim men manage to have 2 or more wives in non Muslim countries, they only register one legally, if any. This is also how they manage to deprive their wives of any legal rights if they divorce them or die. The courts don't recognise the marriages."
37,"*""It's a mortal sin""* except it's not really is it? as all most have to do is say ""sorry sky daddy"" and bingo no sin! So basically, do whatever the hell you like confess and say sorry and no hell for thee!"
38,"Are we sure it is his kid?  She wrote she went to mass ONCE and BOOOOM, she's pregenante. It's a miracle, helloyulia! HoesEanal!"
39,Sexual repression exists in many religions regardless of requirements of abstinence.
40,Never knew that.
41,I like to think that's how the whole immaculate conception thing happened. Oh shit I'm pregnant but It wasn't with my husband!? Ahh I got it ummm god fucked me!
42,"But, but if you act good now, then you are forgiven."
43,Yeah but then they can't eat the jesus meat bread when they go to church.
44,That's also how the Bretheran and FLDS polygamous  christians do that too. Only legally marry one and do a non legally binding church wedding for the rest.
45,"In the catholic church it's still a mortal sin. And being catholic they are avoiding committing a mortal sin as to say ""sorry sky daddy"" they have ti say it via the priest. And if the priest knows they are doing it consistently he can refuse to give them the magic jesus meat bread. Plus if they die before being able to say sorry to the sky daddy via a priest and are in a state of mortal sin...they will go to hell.

The fact that they are sleeping separately shows the lady is well indoctrinated in the fear of hell. The dude not so much as he is watching porn which is also a mortal sin. 

But an interesting thing I noticed is priests are not likely to refuse the magic jesus meat bread to guys who constantly watch porn or even beat their missus. I think the most vile I knew about was a father who had been raping his own daughter since she was 6yrs old. He would confess it to the prest then all was good. Not once did the priests report it to the cops...because ""sanctity of the confessional"". And it's legal for priests to do that in most countries. Fortunately in my state they abolished that special exemption and priests are now mandatory reporters so will go to prison like the rest of us if they knowingly don't report kids being diddled. Of course priests protested and said they'd rather go to prison than protect children."
46,"Mormons, JWs, just about every protestant sect have the same kiddy diddling practices as the catholics. Right now the [the Souther Baptist Convention church is being investigated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2022/05/22/southern-baptist-sex-abuse-report/) for covering up systemic child abuse just like the catholics did. And in the SBC they are not only allowed to marry, women are not allowed to refuse their husband's sex. But the men still abuse kids, often their own or kids in their church. 

Then you get the independents like Josh Duggar who was married and also in a sect where women were not allowed to refuse sex even if they are sick. Hence they have a bazillion kids. The convicted paedos father even admitted in an interview with Megan kelly that it was a common thing in his community. Yikes."
47,I think there have been lots of *claims* of immaculate conception
48,"Right. She found out she was pregnant after the first time she went to Mass‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs gods jizz. But contradicts herself when she says her husband is the dad of her child. Maybe she tells priest she had in vitro or artificial insemination‚Ä¶ with her own husbands jizz? Orrrr it‚Äôs ok to have sex before you become a Catholic but after you become a Catholic you have to be a blank slate and wait for a real Catholic wedding to ever fuck again. Such a mess.
You‚Äôre already married. Being married to an addict of something so boring seems ridiculous. Fuckin snuggle, guys, god damn. There‚Äôs no other reason to cohabitate. Sharing a house sucks. At least get the few perks you can from it"
49,Immaculate conception is the claim that Mary was conceived without original sin. It doesn't refer to Jesus.
50,The immaculate conception refers to Mary‚Äôs conception not Jesus‚Äôs
51,"This gave a good laugh. I think about this often. Seems like such a white lie and Mary just found herself digging a deeper and deeper hole. It became so overwhelming she couldn‚Äôt bear to tell the truth. 

And a religion was born."
52,">The dude not so much as he is watching porn which is also a mortal sin.

Where, precisely, in the bible is porn mentioned? 

&#x200B;

Seems to me that many people create their own version of hell here on earth, out of fear of a hell in the afterlife."
53,"Thanks for the info! I forgot Josh Duggar existed, probably due to being so disgusted that I erased his memory from my brain. Strict religion really fucks people up sexually no matter what I guess."
54,You can do whatever the fuck you want as a Catholic provided you apologize and say *n* Hail Mary's
55,Porn falls under the thought crime of lust which is deemed to be adultery. Hence the church deems it a mortal sin and not a venial sin.
56,"The Duggars are pure trash. Despite their wives having to always be ""joyfully available"" child sex abuse is rife in that community. Even the cop, who was a member of their church, they took Josh to to give him a ""stern talking to"" got caught repeatedly with child sex assault material and is serving a 60 yr sentence. None of these men were abstaining from sex with women or forced to abstain."
57,Geez. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the news of the cop. They are definitely pure trash. Kids shouldn't have to suffer that way ever. Fuck all of them.
