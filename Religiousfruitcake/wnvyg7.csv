1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Simply because Reddit is most popular in majority Christian countries and Christian fruitcakes are more vocal online that other fruitcakes.
2,"Reddit is predominantly a western website with an English language bias. The predominant religion of the English-speaking world is Christianity of some form.

There is nothing more to it than that."
3,"Reddit are more than 50% American and 70% White by the poll, so we can assume that more than half of redditor came from Christian majority countries and are traumatized by Christianity more than other religions.

That’s why post about Christianity are more abundant but still there are plenty post about other religions too in this sub."
4,I'm guessing because most people on reddit are from countries with a majority of chrisitians
5,"Islam is a low hanging fruit, so to speak.  Also most likely majority of users are western background"
6,well that title aged like milk
7,"I'm not sure it's that simple.  There's a bunch of bullshit that come with criticizing other religions, at least in the U.S.  Islam and Judaism are so closely tied with ethnicity that it becomes very murky.  One can get mobbed for being anti/phobic real quick."
8,"Idk, there's some baggage that comes with criticizing religions that are intertwined with ethnicity."
9,How so?
10,"Ehh... Fair point, but it honestly does seem like it's just a matter of volume. The uber-Christians I know are not shy about sharing their opinions loudly, whereas the scarily fundamentalist Muslims I know don't. And I think it's mostly due to fear. If a conservative Christian mouths off and gets shamed, they know that a significant portion of society, including elected politicians, will rally around them. But if you're a member of a smaller religion, you have to be more careful about which beliefs you share, because your community is smaller and those sympathetic supporters might yank that support if you get too extreme"
11,"I said that israel was killing children and got called antisemitic, so, you know how the story goes"
12,I assume they mean because Rushdie was attacked. There are quite a few posts about muslims celebrating the attacker now.
13,"Because with the abundance of posts about praising a religious based attack and wishing death upon the victim, the Christian fruitcakes do some fucked up shit, but most of it doesn’t get close to this level"
