1,"Makes me wonder how these believers think that they know what a supernatural being wants or demands.
Seriously, I think of these religious fruitcakes as mentally disturbed people with delusions."
2,Yah god is very very sensitive
3,"His imaginary sky fairy can eat a bag of dicks.  Well, he can't really because he's not real.  But neither is the bag of dicks."
4,Don't you need a hypodermic needle or an IV setup to take the Lord's name in vein?
5,"> scrolling in the YouTube comments

Your first mistake."
6,Looks like this person admitted that religion isn't logical
7,"Jesus Christ, what a god damn moron"
8,God dam there god seems like a week insecure god.
9,You can tell they're crazy without reading their insane rant. Just look at that punctuation! The entire post is 2 sentences
10,"Is ""Lord's name"" a new name for heroin?  Taken in vein."
11,"Does this dude not recognize that 1. Saying “God” is not saying his God’s name, God’s name is Yahweh and 2. The best interpretation of “don’t use my name in vain” is not “don’t swear”, it’s “don’t use me to justify your own selfish and evil deeds”

Or that simply lots of people don’t like witnessing rape happen *because it’s fucking triggering*"
12,"Even if we give him that his religion is true, in what world does rape not effect your immortal soul?"
13,"My veins contain no “lord’s name”, so I should be safe, I think. It does sound like a very dangerous thing to take intravenously, so thanks for the warning!"
14,"…Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that commandment more about falsely invoking the Lord's authority to support inane and/or immoral causes? Y'know, like roughly 3/4 of the antics of the fundamentalist crowd?"
15,Try getting raped sometime I bet it will change your opinion rather quickly. 😤
16,It will hurt God's wittle feewings if you take his name in vain.
17,"I stopped reading after ""worse than rape"". Jesus Christ, how I wish horrible things down on this person. I am not taking your name in vain but asking you to make this person realise what suffering is."
18,Vein!!! Lol
19,I'm about to take the Lord's name in vain. I would like to have gay sex with Jesus Christ I think he would bless my holy scepter oh yeah and I want Muhammad there to work the nards
20,Well god dame that sure is a bad attitude.
21,"Is that even his real name? Plus he isn’t human. We’re humans, we shouldn’t be focused on air over things that COULD happen to us."
22,*Vain
23,Why are people like this.... this is sickening
24,"This person has obviously never been raped.
 
And they’d be the first to drop a “god damn” in the moment should their fortune ever change."
25,"Yeah, that’s how it is, sure it is…"
26,God damn
27,"The Lord's name is taken in vein, just like cocaine. Now available for ten dollars and 99 cent."
28,Don’t take it in vein guys!
29,"So they are saying people react more to things that make sense, seem likely, are well proven than they do to things that don't make sense and have no evidence?

I hope that's true, it doesn't seem to be in many cases. But I certainly wouldn't consider it unusual or a bad thing."
30,You're so vein ... I bet you think this post is about you.
31,"Personally, I take the lords name in the vein on a regular basis. Ignorance is costly. Hope it's costing her."
32,Talking out of his ass this one
33,How can you be so close yet so far.
34,"I'll take Homophones for $1000, Alex."
35,It's so horrible it makes me want to open a vane.
36,I've got the fear of misusing the words that I'm actually trying to to make a super deep statement!
37,"Aside from the psychotic belief that causing permanent mental and emotional damage to another human being is somehow less bad than saying a ""mean"" word to God..

I have an uncle like this. Gets irate when you say Goddamn but will call black people the n-word in casual dining room discussion. (Granted nothing is casual in dining room discussion in my fam these days.) 

I got his ass when I explained what the definition of vanity is. Taking the Lords name in vain specifically refers to those who grift using God in order to make themselves look better or advance their status in life. They themselves don't necessarily believe in God but will use it to their own benefit. See Joel Osteen and Kenneth Copeland. ""Goddamn"" is essentially a prayer."
38,Junkie Jesus uses the lords name in vein for your sins
39,This person has been taking something else in their vein...
40,"I have never heard anybody ever say Yahwé’s actual name in a movie.  “God” is a title, and that’s why it uses the deferential title Elohim in the original, sometimes even appending it to his name as “Yahwé Elohim”, because it’s a title.  

If we’re counting “Jehova” then yeah, but only in Life of Brian, and that whole thing is a mockery of Christianity.  And Judaism."
41,Taking the Lord's name in vein? Is their lord heroin?
42,"Anyone else besides me pissed that this fucker can’t tell the difference between vein and vain?

Sweet jumping Jesus on a pogo stick that boy needs some grammar education."
43,"Dude , your story literally starts off with education being gods maximum punishment ."
44,Blindy follow a book instead of evidence? What if the governments God? Makes sense that they would make this up for $. Would be an easy thing to do to just convince people to blindly believe in something so they dont question anything. They just use hell to scare people. They dont want people to be educated. Its such a mind fuck that people believe like this and its why we as humans are so fucked.
45,Jesus Christ his goddamn grammar is awful
46,Injecting the blood of christ right into my veins.
47,TIL god is a vaccine : you can take it in vein...
48,This guy is injecting got it would seem.
49,Blasphemy is a victimless crime. Goddammit
50,"Fruitcake sounds like they don’t want to interact with people who take their lord’s name in vain, but seems to fail to see that this is a two-way street and most sane people cannot stand a r4p3 apologist"
51,"Oh no sky daddy feelings will get hurt. God damn Jesus titty fucking Christ you pricks, don't hurt sky daddy's feelings."
52,This kind of crap is why I added several common religious names and terms into my youtube channel's comment filters.
53,So....if our life on this earth isn't what matters then why did their god put us on it?
54,"Vain: producing no result; useless

Vein: any of the tubes forming part of the blood circulation system of the body"
55,"He's just watching the wrong movies.  There are several movies out there that go along the guidelines that he likes, there has to be at least six or seven."
56,"Reminds of something that Eric, the Internet Comment Etiquette Guy, would post."
57,"*vain, *vain, *affects, and *vain"
58,"I always thought it was funny that saying a word in the wrong context is absolutely one of the 10 commandments, but rape is apparently perfectly okay."
59,Please re-read your Bible sis because your interpretation is wrong.
60,*vain. Dickhead.
61,"Wait until he realizes that trauma doesn't go away when you ""become an immortal soul"""
62,"God damnit. Rape only completely ruins lives, Jesus Christ. These people are insane. Christ on a cracker. How can people be so cruel and indifferent to human suffering. Jesus H. Christ. God sakes, it’s like god doesn’t even exist given all the rape murder lack of any substantial evidence AT ALL. But faith. God awful faith. Jeebus. There is more “proof” that the devil exists by that logic. Psycho fucking god damned, jesus on the cross, Christ fuckers, Judas’s."
63,Jesus fucking Christ
64,Lost cause
65,Say JAYZUS heal….  Now pass collection plate
66,They are truly almost be coming self aware
67,"Fun fact taking the lord’s name in vain mean being vain with it, cheapening the mystery, like singing a song saying jesus take the wheel is taking the lord’s name in vain"
68,Talk about draining the main vein....
69,"So is taking the lords name in ""vein"" freebasing god like heroin?"
70,"Wait... you can shoot up god? Like, how do you get him in the syringe? 

Jfc, if you don't know the difference between ""vain"" and ""vein,"" maybe you should leave the comparative ethics to someone else. 

(Also, either this person has never had anything really horrible happen to them, in which case they should maybe stfu about trauma, or their life has been so traumatic they've retreated into delusion.)"
71,"It's in *VAIN* not *vein* 

These illiterate fucking troglodytes I fucking swear"
72,In vein... Lol how I love posts by semi literate bibble thompers!
73,"Point A: “vein” is not “vain”
Point B: “Taking the Lord’s name in vain,” is what hypochristians do all day long. Using God’s name to justify your terrible actions, horrid words, and hateful behavior is what that command states. Not saying “Goddamn.”"
74,"Let me get this straight. This god is supposedly all powerful, he can take away your negative emotions however he is incapable of  controlling his emotions. He is so real, that he absolutely NEEDS everyone to believe and validate him because he can’t do it himself. He can technically choose to feel what he wants since he’s all powerful and all knowing. People are not."
75,"I usually take the name of the lord in pill form. Taking it in the vein is really painful because it punctures the soul. The pill form can make you a bit nauseous though, so it's best taken with a meal. 

/s"
76,My hatred and rage grows daily from these idiot xtians.  I just can’t wrap my head around how dumb you have to be to believe that bs when you really sit down and question it.
77,Is anyone else really bothered by him misspelling vain?
78,"I for real wonder what movie they are talking about because it is actually pretty rare for rape to be depicted in movies.

But it's kind of funny how their mindset is God is more important than humans and using God's name badly hurts God's feelings.

Also, I thought most Christians believe that all sins are equal and there is no greater or lower sin."
79,Does this person assume that if souls existed dead people wouldn't have trauma?
80,Sick spelling bro
81,I always find it funny that their god always backs up their positions. It's always - I know what God wants and its exactly the same thing I want.
82,"Uh. There's a little thing called the 10 commandments. Rape didn't make the list so obviously it's not as bad as taking the Lord's name in vain, which comes in at #3.

/s just in case."
83,I'm sure that most of them *are* mentally disturbed… (The alternative is too depressing to consider.)
84,"Thats what i want to ask them and get a straight answer.

Can you tell me the last time somone actually heard from god. Did not just feel them or something. That received a word of god and its confirmed it was the big man and nothing else."
85,"Especially since in their big book it says no mortal will know the will of sky daddy and to think so is blasphemy. But what do I know, I'm just a filthy heathen."
86,"Religion should enter the list of mental disorders, and with a extremely dangerous, stay away sign."
87,Doesn't the all knowing God know his own creations??
88,And weak
89, I Swear to fucking gawd he is
90,Doesn't care about spelling atrocities though.
91,"A real bag filled with real dicks would be quite disturbing, and not at all appetizing."
92,Can He make a bag of dicks so big that even He can't eat it?
93,One is definitely possible if you good with a blade
94,"[Hey, a bag of Dick's is very real and darned tasty!](https://boingboing.net/2022/09/01/you-should-eat-some-dicks.html)"
95,Only vane people would think that.
96,"Don't inject yourself with the jeebus.  It takes over your mind, clouds your judgment, makes you vulnerable to all manner of suggestion in the absence of the ability to think critically."
97,Mainlining Jesus. Terrible addiction.
98,How was I supposed to know
99,Jesus H. Of Nazarth!  You’re right.
100,"Oh, look at that, you didn't even use the lord's name in vain or vein with this comment"
