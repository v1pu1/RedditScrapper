1,They'll be searching for a long long time.
2,"an ""atheist"" church huh. so... a museum?"
3,"Man, they are Christianing SO hard!"
4,They mock it yet support it at the same time by purchasing admission.
5,So you're teaching your daughter to be as big a stupid asshole as you are. Hope she grows up to be a lesbian atheist
6,This has to be satire right?? No one is actually stupid enough to think atheist church is a thing right??
7,I feel sorry for that little girl. I really hope she can break away from this nonsense when she becomes an adult.
8,"Atheist is the antithesis of the concept of church, but if they find one, can someone let me know? I‚Äôll bring brownies. I hope it‚Äôs at a bar, or I‚Äôd also bring beer."
9,That‚Äôs how you prep your soon to be child bride. Way to go moron
10,"Such a ""good Christian"", teaching your young child to flip the bird..."
11,Kudos for brainwashing your child.
12,"> Atheist church

Uhhh.. wat."
13,"While I hate the Creationist messaging behind this, a little girl flipping off dinosaurs is objectively funny."
14,I HATE LIZARDS I HATE LIZARDS I HATE LIZARDS I HATE LIZARDS
15,Funny...I do the same thing when I pass churches and religious billboards...
16,They'll be searching a while then
17,Here we go again... This is just well executed satire by Christians Against Dinosaurs on Facebook. This is the second time it's been here. This isn't a true believer at all.
18,"[Metal church, the only church, it knows just who you are.](https://youtu.be/NnXZDgJGKvY)"
19,"""Atheist church"" has me convinced that this is satire."
20,"Good luck finding an ""atheist church"""
21,"Um‚Ä¶.they do realise that ‚Äúatheist churches‚Äù don‚Äôt exist right? Like‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the whole point of it :P
Unless they mean a science lab xP"
22,"Did your Jesus around flipping things off, your a horrible parent raising a brat"
23,"I live in Cincinnati. We have an ark built by Christians. It is full of live animals AND  animatronic dinosaurs

Clarify: the ark is technically in Kentucky but it's considered a ""must see"" for Cincinnati tourists along with it's sister attraction, the creation museum."
24,"Ah yes, organized religion. The greatest con ever perpetrated on mankind"
25,Atheist church?!?!?!?!?!?
26,Funny.. I give that same gesture to churches when I drive by.
27,"I would love to have updates about their search for atheist churches.

Day one: no luck
‚Ä¶.
Day 348: these atheists are sneaky bastards, still can‚Äôt find their church"
28,I mean if the class divide is between the educated and ignorant‚Ä¶ I say let the ignorant wallow in their self made crapulence.
29,Maybe next time they should try doing something fun for the kid instead? Fucking loser ass parent.
30,This feels like fake or obvious rage bait
31,"WTF is an ‚Äúatheist church‚Äù? A bar, maybe?"
32,WhY dO lIbErALs InDoCtRiNaTe ThEiR cHiLdReN???m
33,you can't fuck dinosaurs you lil' animalphobe
34,Lmao good luck finding it
35,Atheist... church? LMAO.
36,That poor child
37,That kid is too young to be taught anything about religion beyond saying graces before dinner.
38,What's an atheist church to them? A library??
39,Few things are as interesting to children as the dinosaurs.  I consider this child abuse.
40,"I mean, the updated model would have the dinosaur with feathers, these do need to be updated"
41,Bruh i see this as Millie Bobby browns homeschooled childhood
42,"What happened to ""love thy neighbor""???"
43,Poor kid
44,"As a person born and raised in Alberta, Canada, people denying the existence of dinosaurs is perplexing to me. Dinosaurs, and fossils of all extinct life in general, are ingrained into the identity of our province(there is a fucking albertosaurus skeleton on our government issued photo IDs). You needn't spend more than an hour scouring the southern badlands of the province before you'd find a fossil and see for yourself that these extraordinary animals were existent.

Edit: To be fair, these statues in particular deserve getting flipped off. I mean, just look at how outdated they are. That sauropod is rocking the inverted droop snoot in 2022."
45,"‚ÄúAtheist church‚Äù

Ummmmm‚Ä¶"
46,"Wow. So I guess that‚Äôs a normal thing to teach your child. 

Ps. My nephew, who loves dinosaurs, recently after my dad took him to a museum found out that dinosaurs used to exist and he is even more excited. Apparently it didn‚Äôt matter to him that he thought they were fiction, he still loved them."
47,"""Atheist church""

...the university?

Also, great Job teaching your kid to be a jackass, Jesus must be very proud."
48,"Ah yes, the atheist church, where we worship our atheist god and do our atheist rituals, that atheist church"
49,Good luck finding the atheist church! Wonder what they'll come up with...
50,"There‚Äôs an atheist church I attend to find fellowship, seek a higher power, and tithe a large portion of my income.

It‚Äôs called a bar."
51,But dinosaurs are cool...
52,"Could be wrong here, Poe's law and all, but this smells like onion to me"
53,Good luck finding that atheist church.
54,Poor kid is gonna be heartbroken when she finds out an Atheist church defeats the whole point of being atheist
55,Atheist church?? You...mean a library?
56,"I remember those days with my daddy. He would fight all my teachers proving my (his) answers to many subjects were correct.  If your worried, I haven‚Äôt told you my moms name is Karen. Now that I‚Äôm reading this I‚Äôm so ashamed."
57,"I hope their search for an ""atheist church"" leads them to the Unitarians. That encounter would be entertaining as hell for the Unitarians."
58,"Good luck finding a atheist church, weirdos."
59,That‚Äôs so fucking sad
60,I swear I got jump scared by an animatronic version of those things when I was a kid so yah üñïthose for the trauma but also fuck the science denial
61,I wish them good luck in their search
62,Some say they‚Äôre still searching to this very day
63,We have churches?
64,I thought Jesus rode dinosaurs.
65,Atheists have churches?
66,An‚Ä¶an athiest church??????????
67,Shes flipping them cuz theyre so inaccurate
68,"According to those Christians in Kentucky (or Tennessee?) with the giant ark replica, dinosaurs were on the ark right beside Noah and his family. Wonder if these people will ever hit that place up and try to flip off the robotic dinosaurs there. 

(If they did, I honestly think they would probably get beat tf up. That ark place is really fucking weird.)"
69,Wait. What??? ü§£
70,"At first I was shocked but I suppose the type of person that gets value from flicking off dinosaur statues is the type of person stupid enough to think there are ""atheist churches"""
71,Not letting your child enjoy dinosaurs like all the other kids is just sadistic.
72,"What an outstanding productive weekend! This kid is going to be very broadminded, and have a scientific temper. üòÇ"
73,"They just found a half a million-year-old Elephant Tusk in Israel, but can't agree on where Jesus is buried. That Little girl is facing the wrong way if she is going to flip something off."
74,"Regardless of your religious beliefs (or lack thereof), teach your children to be kind.   Just.  Be.  Kind.  To everyone.  

Never flip someone off.  Never punch someone.  Never speak an unkind word.  These are an absolute waste of energy.

Being kind is never a waste of energy.  You‚Äôll be repaid for it, somewhere down the line."
75,Sigh. Can I sell them a map to Shangri La as well then? That'll be easier to find.
76,"Wait, atheist church? Are those a thing? Lol"
77,It could be Ironic
78,If god did exist he would be disappointed
79,Word on the street is she's still searching.
80,"I can't even imagine a young child not only unimpressed or amazed by the idea of dinos but outright hatefully rejecting it. However, there's pictures. This poor girl had part of her childhood wonder stolen and replaced with hate. She doesn't even know it happened"
81,"""Look at how hateful I made my little child."""
82,Good luck finding an Atheist church
83,"Atheist church huh? 
 
People like these should be sterilized at birth."
84,They might be a while looking for that atheist church. Lol
85,I always find it so funny that some christians see BIG LIZARD as such an affront to their religion.
86,"""Atheist Church""?

Do you think they even know what ""Atheist"" means or is it just a thing they've been told is bad/evil/literally the devil?"
87,What the hell is an Atheist Church?
88,Please film your search for the Atheist church and post it widely.
89,"""Atheist church""

  Like... A library or museum?"
90,Christians out here grooming like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. These people are the worst.
91,Imagine flipping off a plastic dinosaur and thinking you're sane.
92,"when i asked my girlfriend what she thinks where the dinosaur bones come from she answered:

""scientists burried them there to fool us all"""
93,This is so toxic and unhealthy. Wow
94,Atheist church? So a lab?
95,"1.	lol
2.	freedom of religion/religion acceptance? is that not americas thing anymore? I know that was part of our brochure when we advertised our country and independence to get others being persecuted for their beliefs in other countries to come here..well nothing lasts forever i guess."
96,They‚Äôre going to be searching for that ‚ÄúAtheist church‚Äù for a loooooooong time.
97,"Even the dinosaur is like [what the fuck, kid.](https://imgur.com/44eR6RT.jpg)"
98,The fact that they think atheists have a church speaks volumes
99,"I believe the children are our future,  

Teach them well and let them lead the way 

\-Whitney Houston"
100,This is just hilarious. Those pics are such good meme material honestly. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a little kid flipping off a dinosaur.
