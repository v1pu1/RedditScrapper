4,"This isn't the argument. The argument is that what we call angels/demons always took the form of what modern society calls aliens. The argument also tends to be that these entities are higher-dimensional, in something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q) type of conception of reality, which is why they are able to seemingly pop in and out of existence in our 3D space.

Most people in these types of circles are also into various apocrypha beyond the canon Bible. For example, the Apocryphon of John depicts the creation of the earth by the leader of these entities, a malevolent entity called Yaldabaoth, (known as YHWH or the LORD in the canon Bible,) who also created a group of lesser beings to serve him and rule us, known as ""archons."" These entities are often assumed to be what modern people call ""aliens.""

Thus, it's less ""UFO sightings are angel sightings,"" and more ""those are two words for the same event, and assuming we know enough about either of these concepts to claim an understanding of what is happening is ignorant."" At least, that's *my* argument, and the one I see most commonly depicted in those circles. I wouldn't say angels are more like what we think of as aliens, *or* that aliens are more like what we think of as angels - just that these concepts have been confused to the point of being treated as two separate phenomena, when they aren't.

Source: I am also insane. You should in no way trust what I have to say on the subject unless your own lived experiences have presented evidence to justify doing so. I merely hope to clarify what these people are saying, not to get anyone here to believe it."
5,I really appreciate the explanation.
