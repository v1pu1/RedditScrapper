1,"You could change the wording to ""Christians after typing 'thoughts and prayers!' when referring to yet another mass shooting""."
2,Sky Judge and Sky Murderer just don‚Äôt roll off the tongue.
3,"How bout ""Deadbeat Sky Daddy""? Is that better?"
4,"I've always liked ""purportedly magical sky jew""."
5,I'm gonna go crawl under my covers and have a mental health day after that one. ü§ï ü§£
6,She does look pretty comfortable.
7,The fact that some Christian made a meme about it shows how saying ‚ÄúSky Daddy‚Äù gets under their skin.
8,"It is stupid, childish, and dangerous. You can paste together a meme where the guy saying that is a crumpled weak nerd and the Christian saying ""No."" is a chad. But Christians didn't create those drawings or that format, so that's just as rehashed as saying ""sky daddy""

In fact I could take the meme template above and write ""Christians after calling an atheist smug in response to a comment pointing out how idiotic their beliefs are, without proving them wrong in any way."""
9,I‚Äôm an Atheist and I think ‚Äúsky daddy‚Äù is pretty cringe.
10,"Sky daddy

Edit: holy shit dudes, it works! Do it!"
11,"I don‚Äôt get it. Did a fruitcake make the meme? Cuz if so, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs dissing on Atheists. ü§£ That woman looks like she is having a nice day"
12,">Christianity is the religious version of a¬†Top 20 Greatest Hits¬†compilation album- a dash of Egypt, a pinch of Rome and zoroastrianism for garnish. All on a bed of Jewish monotheism"
13,Super Saiyan Santa Claus.
14,I prefer ‚Äúinvisible sky wizard‚Äù but sky daddy is fine too
15,Well the sky daddy does trace his origin back to old Indo-European mythology...
16,Xtians after denying a 10 year old an abortion:
17,"Ya, know, they get kinda triggered by the sky daddy thing. Hmmm."
18,I dunno I feel quiet refreshed after dropping a sky daddy comment
19,I happen to prefer invisible sky fairy myself.
20,Maximum cope achieved
21,Whew! Burrrrrrrn!
22,"In fairness it is puerile.  Let's be more grown up.

Figment of your imagination is a far more apt discription."
23,"Outgroup: makes a joke about your ingroup

Ingroup: You're group does that same thing!"
24,"Exactly my expression, and i love typing it every time."
25,It's just taken out of context.
26,"Yeah, they got me here. I also get a similar high from down voting their comments."
27,"I never knew so many religious people get so butthurt over ""sky daddy"""
28,"Hey, if it's bothering them enough to meme about it... It's working"
29,"Oh come one peeps. Those are just people making memes, nothing fruitcake about that.

Get angry when someone uses religion to justify his hatred of woman, not when they are making a meme about you"
30,"""My counter argument is that I don't like that you made fun of me!"""
31,"Ngl, typing that does make me smile for some reason"
32,"""Atheists just say the same things again and again!""

Proceeds immediately to telling you about Pascal's Wager and the Kalam cosmological argument, and asks ""Then why are there still monkeys?"""
33,"I've never said ""sky daddy"". I always say ""magic man in the sky""."
34,"Whether you're religious or not, the name ""Sky Daddy"" should be used more."
35,"I always laugh at posts like these, not even because it's like, oh religious people and stuff but because where I'm from, it's not only normal for adults to say ""Sky daddy"" but also is highly encouraged towards children to do it as well, so it's always a little of a cultural shock for me lol"
36,me after ignoring theists
37,"""Sky Daddy"" is a great way to wind up deity-worshipers. My personal favorites:

Jesus: That Thorny Headed Guy

God: Flappy sky fairy thingy that you lot like to bang on about."
38,I‚Äôm an atheist and think sky daddy is pretty cringe
39,This one‚Äôs true though
40,this is actually kinda funny tho got gona lie
41,Just because Christians do the same thing doesn‚Äôt make this untrue
42,Christians get butthurt so quickly
43,What‚Äôs the problem. They aren‚Äôt allowed to poke fun at us? We do say that a lot
44,This is actually funny though cause there definitely are atheists like this lol
45,I prefer imaginary friend
46,"I prefer ""invisible friend"" personally."

49,Someone's a little insecure about their skydaddy.
50,I actually laughed at this
51,They've got like what? One book in 2000 years.
52,Atheists look like that after typing anything because we live happier lives without Christian guilt and nonsense.
53,vocal theists getting triggered by the smallest things :
54,I prefer bible fandom
55,Yeah as if you reddit assholes are known for also being totally original.
56,Or Christians after typing ‚Äúit‚Äôs all part of Gods plan‚Äù under a post with child cancer patient.
57,"""Christians after calling an atheist smug in response to a comment making valid points about how idiotic and destructive their beliefs are, without proving them wrong in any way."""
58,"I think the best one for this would be Christians after ""identifying as an attack helicopter"""
59,i just call him the ascended bitch
60,Went out for smokes 6000 years ago and never came back.
61,It doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs just cringe and unoriginal. You can admit Christians are unoriginal while also admitting atheists are too.
62,"Same, this meme is so on point"
63,It's literally a childish way to call God in my country.
64,"um ackshully, it's Rudolph that is Super Saiyan; Santa is just ridin them coattails."
65,I‚Äôm partial to ‚Äúsky fairy‚Äù myself
66,Obi Wan isn't invisible. Put some respect on the man.
67,Firmament Figment might fit.
68,"Short answer: No

Longer answer: The class that is actively working to oppress people does not have licence to spew nonsense."
69,like one of those imaginary friends we all had as kids?
70,"Sky daddy says you get a cookie for your bravery!

But for real mate. This idea that christians are quiet about their beliefs is fucking laughable considering they literally try and control governments.

ETA: And this isn't even touching on the sheer volume of christians/theists worldwide. Playing the victim is a really weak position."

72,"""We humans can't hope to understand the creator of the universe! He works in mysterious ways!"""

74,I call him narcissist in the clouds.
75,Didn't he supposedly came back 2022 or 2023 years ago just to rape a minor in a barn?
76,Well he does love the smell of burning flesh
77,I give it 5 years when he comes bumming back and asking to borrow money.
78,Do we need to invent a new word for sky daddy every time we mention cloud papa? They don't reinvent the word for their cirrus father every time they talk about their aerosol padre?
79,"You do reliase that not all of us are like thay?, and why the  fuck do you ""fruitcake haters"" associate my religion with white American evangelicals?."
80,"You just nailed it perfectly. Atheist seek knowledge while theist covet ignorance.....aggressively stupid, gold jerry, gold!!"
81,I'm no expert on the Bible but that sounds like him.
82,"No, but you just made my day a bit brighter."
83,"Sky daddy looks like it‚Äôs trying to be mocking and funny but falls flat on its face. It just seems immature , and is overused as fuck, in my opinion"
84,"[This You?](https://www.reddit.com/r/excarrots/comments/wf1fxg/based_family_member/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

That you're posting stuff like that kinda speaks to being being 'like that'.

You're also on antithesistcheescake which is a shithole of hate."
85,"Haha, as if white American evangelicals are the only religious group people don't like. Most religions are guilty of taking away other people's rights because of superstitious bullshit."
86,"While I agree generally, be careful with the term ‚Äú theist.‚Äù There are like a bajillion definitions."
87,"It is mocking, obviously. But what alternatives are there? Evidentially this one works, so why change?"
88,"I don‚Äôt understand? This is just a joke about how atheists overuse the term sky daddy, which this comment section is proving correct. This doesn‚Äôt make them a religious fruit cake. Also you can‚Äôt judge someone‚Äôs ideals just from the subreddits they‚Äôre in lmaoo"
89,Ya...i probably wont.
90,There‚Äôs 2
91,Idk maybe don‚Äôt say it and save yourself from looking like an edgy atheist 14 year old who‚Äôs incapable of holding mature conversations ?
92,... need to.
93,Who uses sky daddy in an actual conversation? I‚Äôve only ever seen it used in respons to religious fruitcakes where an actual conversation is never going to happen anyway.
94,Its all friutcakey to me..equally.
95,"Lots of people, actually"
96,Do you understand how ellipsises are normally used?
97,Nope...fill me in.
98,"They are usually used to indicate an omission of words. In the case of my usage I was using it to show a continuation of your thought by indicating I was omitting the rest of the post you already made. So it would read(starting with your use of ellipses);""... I probably won't need to."
99,Awful preachy for this sub...
100,I filled you in.
