1,Some fish will just refuse anything that isn't alive. I personally prefer they eat worms at most though. Keeping feeders is a pain.
2,Yeah... I guess carnivorous fish are meant to starve by God's Grand Design of making them carnivorous. Could these people please spend a few hours underwater trying to prosthelytize the fish? Preferably without rebreathers?
3,"So God made obligate carnivores and is just like ""lolol sin or starve fuckers."""
4,"God's best creations are goldfish?

> Peace be upon you, unkind stranger, rethink your ways and repent. Shame.

Sounds like they should be directing this at God, seeing as he apparently created things to eat his ""best creations""."
5,"This reads like satire, but I'm not sure, because there are people that actually think like this"
6,"This person would tell me I’m going to burn in hell if they knew why I go to the pet store to purchase a rat every two weeks I guess.

I wonder where they stand on mealworms."
7,"If your god suggests that goldfish are the most joyful creatures, you should find a new god"
8,Sharks are supposed to eat algae with all their sharp teeth obviously! /s
9,"Those carnivorous species should be ashamed and turn toward a vegan diet. The cichlids need to understand suffering is good. 

I wonder how much cow and chicken this person eats per month? Cows and chickens aren’t as special and glorious as goldfish I guess."
10,"I’ve had people go crazy over my shrimp art, so this is very believable"
11,"From what I understand, our sinful nature is what caused carnivores."
