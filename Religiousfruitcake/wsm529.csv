1,At least that's as possible as any other time. I'm more worried about this hideous artwork.

5,Tbvh that's a legitimate blasphemy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

7,"Aye no. 12 am is 00:00

8,The artwork is hideous but The scriptures potray him the most attractive of all
9,"No it's not a blasphemy but one of the fictional story from the life of Krishna which people *believes* to be true (still those visuals are horrific)

Story:  In childhood Krishna used to stole butter from their neighbors. One day a lady caught him doing that and tied him up with a pole. Then she goes to Krishna's mother to complain about it. But Krishna's mother tells her that Krishna is in the room and calls him and he comes. That lady gets confused and goes to see the place where she tied him. And guess what he is still tied. Then miracle happens and she sees 'GOD'."
10,"Wow, I didnâ€™t know that. I was just making a joke lol."
11,"That's confusing. How is 12 am the 0th hour of the morning and not the 12th hour of the morning.

Edit : You're right, after looking at the Wikipedia explanation, the am/pm system has like 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's till very confusing but you were right."
12,I'm talking about hedious artwork to be blasphemy
13,"Talking about how UGLY it is, not the content."
14,Hindus had shravan is a month in Hindu Calendar system so he may concluded from that coz shravan starts in end of June and lasts upto mid August
