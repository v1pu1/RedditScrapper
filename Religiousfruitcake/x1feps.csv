8,Iâ€™ve just eaten out and I had his Auntie
9,bruh moment when cows have more rights than human women
10,Lmao. Everyone else posting actually related media here. But some of these Indians are not done criticizing their ruling party. Bro keep your politics out of this.
11,"How does this fit in the sub, its a joke"
12,Glad he confirmed. Also thats subtly suggesting that indians (specifically the upper casks) are the most perfect people on earth and they think all other races below them. Fun.
13,Jizzus
14,The whole Party is a troll party
15,That made me hungry
16,Not in india at least
17,In USA? For sure
18,"Must suck to be an idiot, right?"
19,"Bruh, India allows for abortion, US doesn't."
20,And this is what happens if you take reddit posts at face value...
21,"Given that you are a sucker for this party, someone pointing out their stupid comments is big deal for you rather than the comment itself"
22,No it isnt. You are just hurt
23,Itâ€™s pretty funny tho. Are there any other entertaining slogans they have?

25,I wouldn't know
26,US is shithole I know. Don't care I'm not from there.
27,The point isn't one party's stupid comments. The point is showing selectively only one party's comments and not seeing the stupid in others. This reduces the credibility of criticism.
28,Bruh you are just easily offended

30,"cows are a regular theme with this party and there are various compilations of the statements they made involving cows. here's one :

35,"So according to you every other party is literate? Nope. Also being literate doesn't indicate intelligence (in this matter related to social and political issues).

 I checked those links and I think all of them are from left leaning handles/organizations . That shows biased information which goes on par what they are trying to show. The same thing right leaning organizations do. All of them are manipulative and liars. It's just whose lies are below the limit overall population is willing to ignore and whose are above them."
36,">So according to you every other party is literate? Nope. Also being literate doesn't indicate intelligence (in this matter related to social and political issues).

Sorry, there must be some deeper meaning  in saying ""foreign cows are aunties"" that my illiterate head is not able to understand. 
Or saying ""cows exhales oxygen"". Must be some next level scientific discovery that even the scientific community is unaware of.
They are just genius. 

>I checked those links and I think all of them are from left leaning handles/organizations .

Yes, news18 is owned by Ambanis, you know the communist commander-in-chief of the all india communist enterprise. 

 >That shows biased information which goes on par what they are trying to show.

Can you point out what is biased about their 'reports' ?

> The same thing right leaning organizations do. All of them are manipulative and liars. It's just whose lies are below the limit overall population is willing to ignore and whose are above them.

Interesting, for someone whose timeline shows 5 out of 6 posts are on [r/sham_sharma_show](https://www.reddit.com/r/sham_sharma_show), the  echo chamber of the right wing circle jerks, to have that opinion"

38,"1st . What he said was stupid . My point was that he is alone in this stupidity. The continued part meant that there are people (almost everywhere) who have degree and all the features of being literate but they don't know how to handle social and political matters(such as Congress head Rahul Gandhi or Joe Biden).

2nd.  i should have written most of them instead all of them. But that point will still stay true.

3rd . well if you are trying to see them as neutral (as much as one can because IRL we all are atleast a little biased by nurturing) , then their bias will be clearly seen. A common example being never taking up matters related to other minorities with as much enthusiasm as they do for muslim minority. Another being , most of them don't have the conscience to say what they should (atrocities/crimes committed on majority are still crimes) if they present themselves as ""leftist and/or liberal"" . How  they also play the game they so show to despise(trp and sold journalism) .

Lastly, 4 out of 5 are on that reddit are on that because there are where those media belong . When I will find something to post on other reddit i will. I rarely post on reddit even after so much time.
 I have deleted my earlier account with which I came on on reddit( and Instagram, Twitter and others) looking for left leaning pages/handles but none of them were doing what they think of them as. That's why I left them(no pun intended). I don't know from where do you belong but in India, bjp (and for that matter the current version of right wing including its own faults) is the one eyed king (not good enough but better than other blinds). The population has seen so many ups and downs that they know what type of govt. they need as a whole.  
Regarding the echo chamber jerks - well tell me which of subreddit don't have them. The left pages have theirs and the right theirs. r/sham_sharma_show originally talked of matters of real concern in a proper way. But yes it has become repetitive."
39,"Bloody heck the post must have really touched your nerves to waste your time typing this long ass comment which contain no sense.

What actually is your gripe here ?
That i don't waste my whole day making my own compilation of all the stupid things said by all politicians ever! That i just googled and linked the first few result that popped on Google and pasted here as a sample ?
Really ?

The links i provided have samples from politicians across party lines so get a grip on your butthurt lol 

>1st . What he said was stupid . My point was that he is alone in this stupidity.

Fine you make list of what Joe Biden ( Eve  though he is not an Indian politician) and let me see. I just don't have the time.

For Rahul Gandhi, yeah i remember the right wing echo chambers  cutting  out part of his speeches and sharing them out of context.
The 'alu se sona' jibe that the circle jerks still  use as a taunt  was actually Rahul  taking a jibe at Modi/BJP.  That was not hai actual thoughts.but of course  right wing  dumbasses had to take that out of context cus that's what they do best.

> 2nd. i should have written most of them instead all of them. But that point will still stay true.

Go ahead , give all the examples you have. Don't  expects others to do that otherwise.

>3rd . well if you are trying to see them as neutral (as much as one can because IRL we all are atleast a little biased by nurturing) , then their bias will be clearly seen.

Now you are unpacking unrelated packages on an unrelated post on a sub not meant for that. Have some gripe, post on the  Sharma sub and let the echo chamber heal the pain for you.
Most of your claims are right wing hogwash anyway with no substance. When was the last time you posted anything about atrocities faced by Dalits by the upper caste Hindus ?  So shut the fugde ho with their partiality sermons.

Nice bs. But i am not buying it sorry."
