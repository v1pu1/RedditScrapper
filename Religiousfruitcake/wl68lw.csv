1,"Thanks for nothing you fucking bitch, Satan loves you"
2,"I mean if you wanna go more literal her baby’s are in hell.

They were unable to accept Jesus"
3,That's just so wrong. Why would anyone say the bible is a great read?
4,It's not a great read. It's boring as hell.
5,The Bible says anything I want it to say because I don't read the Bible.
6,They wonder why people mock them !
7,"Goes to show the world would be a better place if everybody could just accept that dead people are dead. Not angels, not sleeping, not waiting for you in heaven. Religion wouldn't have even a fraction of the power it does if the average person could find it within themselves to let go of lost loved ones instead of living their entire lives by some bullshit hoping to one day be reunited. This euphemizing and pussyfooting around the matter of death are both symptoms and perpetuating factors of religious fascism."
8,They can't pull their head out of their self-righteous ass long enough to have some actual human empathy.
9,"Ah yes. Mother to a stillborn baby here. Can confirm people say the dumbest, most insensitive shit to you after loss, especially repeated loss."
10,Well no. I’ve read that book… it’s a horrible mess of a book. Like the worst I’ve ever read.
11,Because you're a little piece of shit.
12,"They could have left out the “they aren’t angels” bit. It comes across as cold and bitter, particularly talking to someone that has suffered the trauma of  a miscarriage and still birth."
13,"Religious people argueing is the same as LOTR fans bickering over what is, and what isn't, canon."
14,I didn’t know religums had neck beards. Wow.
15,"Doesn’t this just make more sense though? You’re telling me this all-loving god is killing babies and not Satan to build some kind of demon army? 

Plus, unborn babies can’t be baptized."
16,"Babies all end up in purgatory if they're unbaptised because it's not fair somehow that they died and were unable to be given ""protection"" by Jesus. The people that end up in hell basically chose it somehow. Religious people are weird."
17,"I find it funny because I follow this webcomic called ""Adventures of god"" and, while at times it's a wee bit preachy, other times it hits the nail in the head with fierce power.

Last strip, a wanker suggests to god to do a mlre grimdark and gritty reboot of the bible, to which he proceeds to start reading the book to him. Said wanker end in a therapy group for ""peoole who have actually read the bible"". 

Just to rub salt in the wound, he expresses his amazement at the utter and total lack of priests there, to which Gabriel chimes in with ""Very good observation"""
18,"I mean, Song of Solomon has its moments."
19,"I like Revelations only because of the striking imagery. Hell yes keep describing Babylon as a woman atop a great draconic beast. Tell me about the Four Horsemen and the havoc they wreak upon the world. The actual god-related stuff is boring though. 'Look, they're animals... But they have tons of eyes!! And they praise god!'"
20,"Yeah, different flavors of Christianity have [different opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_in_Christianity) about stuff like this.

It is, for instance, easy to take from the Bible the idea that *nobody* who has died has gone to heaven yet. That will only happen after the Second Coming. The dead are all just dead, so far, but the righteous dead will be resurrected and go to Paradise after Jesus does something that he said he was going to do quite soon...

...2000 years ago...

There is however definitely **no** way to honestly interpret the Bible as saying that any human who dies can possibly become an **angel**. I mean, God could obviously do that if he wanted to, but that's not what the Bible says.

(That ""Biblically accurate angel"" meme about how bizarre the Seraphim and Cherubim or whatever are supposed to look isn't quite correct, either. Yes, there are bizarre angels in the Bible, but there are also entities sent by God that just look like normal people. [The extremely plausible story of Lot](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019&version=NIV) wouldn't make much sense if the two ""angels"" involved, whom the dissolute locals wanted to rape, were terrifying assemblages of eyes and wings and so on.)"
21,"I often say ""If you've read the Bible and weren't disgusted, you either didn't understand it or are evil""."
