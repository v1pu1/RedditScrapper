1,It would be dangerous for a girl to workout around this dude.
2,Yes. That is incredibly creepy. I will never understand people who can’t just look away.
3,"I would prefer this approach over restricting other peoples freedom because of your religious convictions. If he is aware of his ""struggle"" with temptation, he should remove himself from temptation. Not the other way around."
4,"This is an example of why ""modesty culture"" (common in both Christian and Muslim fundamentalism) hurts everyone. It victim blames women by telling them that negative attention is their fault for how they're dressed, and it infantilizes men by telling them that they're helpless and unable to resist any biological urges - that they should be scared of any women dressed even a little revealing because they'll be compelled to harass/assault."
5,"Dares to advocate for the execution of every apostate, but doesn't dare to work out in the presence of the opposite gender"
6,"Doesn’t that mean he’ll go beat off afterwards? Or be tempted to? 

Religion is a helluva drug"
7,"I read this thing the other day, maybe even from this sub, where Muslim men don't allow young boys to gyms or whatever because of temptation as well - see, it's not just women. Everyone can be fucked by Muslim men and they see temptation everywhere... So everyone, cover up."
8,Yeah these fellas think exclaiming this to the world somehow makes them look pious and morally grounded but in reality it makes them look like creepy as fuck.
9,"“See what you made me do!”  

—slogan of abusers everywhere"
10,Muslim men will not accept the fact that temptation can be resisted. They’ll blame it on the “devil” whispering in their ear. Fucking creepy indeed.
11,10/10 neck beard there
12,"I honestly don't have a problem with people practicing their religion in any way that does not affect anyone but the individual practicing, BUT it's always so gross to see people like this and Mike Pence who just cannot fathom how to interact with women in a platonic way. I just can't understand how you could only look at women as a temptation, as if their whole existence is just something a higher power brought into existence as a test for men. How dehumanizing for everyone involved."
13,"More like Fitna dick in my mouth, am I right fellas?"
14,"The only thing I agree with this picture is that people like Ali dawah should definitely be a timezone away from all women. 24/7, forever."
15,Do Muslim men have no self-control whatsoever?  I see this attitude with a lot of hard right leaning Christians and Jews as well.  Is there something about these ideologies that makes a man particularly rapey or something?  I honestly do not understand why its so hard for these guys to keep their dicks in their pants when they see women that aren't hidden completely by a black sack.
16,"Fitna? Only fitna I need is ""fitna"" dick in my mouth AYY LMAO"
17,"Huh? He can’t work out during daylight hours because women are also at the gym exercising? That absolutely sounds like a him problem. Funny when someone says they have a problem with something someone else is doing, the onus is not on the other person, the onus is on the person with the problem. That’s why it’s called, “your problem”. You can’t control the lives and behavior of people around you, and sometimes they will do things that bother you. If you are upset or bothered by other people existing and living their lives in your vicinity, that’s on you. I guess what I’m saying this guy needs to cry me a fucking rover, build a bridge over that river, and get the fuck over it you giant man child."
18,Im not responsible for my actions. You are responsible to avoid my actions at all costs.
19,"> not my fault if I am tempted, it's their fault.


Can only lead to disaster..."
20,Good. We don’t want your weak ass in the gym either. Get a peleton
21,"Am I missing something, or is claiming ""fitna"" just a way to make your inability to control your sexual impulses someone else's fault?"
22,Let's put a lock device on his dick. The world will be a safer place.
23,"Going by the picture presented - I'm pretty sure he is not causing any ""fitna"" in any of the women at the gym."
24,Fitna make a mess in his trousers. Ayyy.
25,Only animals can’t control their urges.
26,Why is he in the western country? Go back to Islamic country and enjoy the freedom.
27,"If it keeps him away from women, I'm all for it."
28,"Dude should be kept away from children, and farm animals."
29,"Aight cool, you found a way around your temptation. 

Do you really have to make a public post where you admit that you avoid the opposite gender because just *seeing* a feminine person is just too much sexual temptation?"
30,"Yes, I've always thought that. It's an intrinsic part of that religion that they punish the women, by making them wear what they describe as modest clothes, for the feelings that the men have (ie. physical attraction). Instead of just teaching the men to learn to control themselves. 

So backwards."
31,It’s creepy as fuck. People like this are genuinely dangerous for women to be around.
32,People like these should never actually exist. As simple as that.
33,Well.... glad he's staying away from us.
34,"Hella creepy. His ""vision casting"" function that any decent human being has must be broken."
35,Sounds like a win/win. He needs therapy though
36,“I’m a victim of the religion I choose to follow”
37,"No doubt they're throwing themselves at his feet, mesmerized by the beauty of his chin pubes and accompanying soul patch."
38,Fitnas dick in ur mouth lmao got em
39,"I love how these guys are like, “I’m a good person, a man of god… but I have zero self control and might rape a woman”"
40,If a grown man can’t go into a public space because he would be too horny… yay that’s a 🚩 for a predator.
41,Its in his own control to be tempted or not
42," Just cut off those balls , no balls , no temptation ,no feelings so u won't get disturb by anything . Infact no one can seduce u anymore."
43,"Meanwhile, this cisgender lesbian does not have an issue.

Hmmm...🤔"
44,sounds like hes fitna be a douchebag
45,"Religious people are fucking weird, man."
46,If you’re addicted to sugar don’t visit a candy shop? Same rules. Who is this douche to suggest like 10-50 or more women should have to adapt to their shedule for him?
47,"Rub one out before hitting the gym, u fucking troglodyte."
48,Does he even lift?
49,Why not just ban women from using the same gym?  They are so inconvenient.  /s
50,"Well, Ali, hate to break it to you, but women exist. I know, the horror, right?"
51,The fuck is wrong with people that they need to avoid or completely cover women because they can't control themselves. Sounds like they're saying they're rapists without saying they're rapists. Creepy as fuck.
52,"AND, it's the women's fault for being there.  Don't forget that's what they think."
53,"How fucking lousy is your god if he created you with these urges, and the mind not to act on them, but you still have to go through all these mental gymnastics to be in compliance with his rules? It must be fucking exhausting."
54,Men who talk like this are closet rapists
55,Islam seems to cultivate more weak willed men than most religions. It also seems to provide them with lots of ways to be horrible people by virtue of a dick.
56,"They did a sexual harrassment study in Egypt. They found nearly 80% women who were sexually harassed wore full burkas.

It doesn't matter how much women hide themselves because Muslim men will use any excuse to avoid accountability.

Women are not the issue."
57,Full of fitna... fitna dick in your mouth got emmm
58,I didn’t see what subthis was and I thought it was a ligma or deez joke
59,"Temptation?! He speaks as if it is a candy that he is trying to avoid. Its another human ffs. 
Women are so damn dehumanized by this cult..."
60,"Yes, it's fantastically creepy when anyone puts the onus on a woman to make changes to stay safe from men."
61,fitna these nuts in your mouth was how it thought this was going. im very disappointed
62,One of those who find clean shaven men feminine enough to give them disturbing feelings.
63,"Out here, telling on himself, wanting people to see him as the victim.  Fuck this guy, and every person like him, into the ground.  

If I was the gym owner, I'd cancel his membership if I saw this because he's flat out telling the world that he's a danger to the women around him.  Lawsuits be damned."
64,"So long as he puts restrictions on himself rather than women, it’s no problem."
65,"it's no different from that white guy who went viral going off on those girls at the beach for wearing swimsuits

just insecurities and projections based on their own skewed worldview"
66,kinda of a weird way to admit you are a horny creep but ok
67,"Go to a incel-only gym, similar to women only ones, for safety"
68,"I mean, how many times do we see videos of women in majority Muslim countries that are being extremely harassed or being forced into a horrible situation by a gang of men. 

Maybe sexually suppressing the entire Muslim world isn’t the best idea."
69,"if your eyes cause you to sin, then pluck them out"
70,It's like he is a child that never learned self control. So sad
71,He has stated that he can’t be around girls because he doesn’t know what he could be tempted to do. This guy needs to have a deep dive done into his past.
72,Goes to show. You can work out all day every day and still be weak as fuck
73,As gymbros we dont claim him
74,When self control isn’t part of the curriculum
75,">If thine eye offends you then pluck it out

Not regulate other's behaviour."
76,Bro's out here admitting on social media that he stares at girls asses at the gym.
77,Why so weak willed?
78,"I go to gym and woman are there , I never have them thoughts , no I’m not gay .. I evolved and respect people"
79,Buddy! i cannot go to gym in day time because i am perverted mother fucker who cannot go into a public space with women because I might not be able to control PeePee Buddy
80,Plot twist he's not talking about girls
81,He would get hiss ass beat during the day cuz he probably stares like most goat fuckers do
82,"If he can’t stop himself from being tempted maybe he should just stay in his house, not drive anywhere, and cover himself from head to toe with cloth including a screen over his eyes when he does go out. I’ve heard that prevents temptation and bad behavior."
83,"At least he's restricting himself, and not trying to tell the women what to do or not do."
84,"Their beards doesn't prove shit about their so called ""masculinity"". This just shows how weak they are."
85,"What's weird is he posted in ex Muslim, which means he's smart enough to know Islam is pure bullshit but he's dumb enough to keep the woman hating aspects of Islam"
86,Lmao he sounds like an incel who has never touched a woman before
87,Titty temptation?
88,"Yeah, *fitna* taco in my mouth!"
89,"As a gay man I have to say he is SOOO HOT!!! Why is he causing this temptation in me? I want to be pure in the eyes of God and he's making me imagine things my mind's eye can't unsee. His sinful abandon and refusal to cover himself from my eyes causes my soul to be in danger. The only solution for me, obviously is to kill him."
90,"""Fitna"" dick in his mouth.

Got him."
91,I notice hot girls in the gym too. Does it paralyze me. Are you so ill equipped to handle your own humanity that the site of female flesh turns you into a feral animal....what peace have you been granted?
92,religion lmfaoooo
93,Yup this is a piece of shit asshole using religion as an excuse to be a piece of shit asshole.
94,It's funny how I am not a Muslim yet can be around women any time day or night without being a creepy fucker.
95,Dumbass...and stop making selfies in the gym. Work out and fuck off.
96,It’s really unfortunate that a mammal has to suppress all its basic mammalian urges just because ancient dead people told them to.
97,"I kinda wonder what part of their religion leads to this kind of ‘temptation’. Maybe purposely keeping men and women separate isn’t the healthiest idea

Though I don’t disagree, phrasing it like this is kinda creepy"
98,"Listen, if you can’t control yourself but other men can maybe it’s not the girls faults. Maybe, it’s you."
99,"I would say the average normal adult guy could have a woman completely naked in front of him, and still be able to control himself. This boy is pathetic"
100,"I thought it was going to be a ""fitna these nuts in your mouth"" type joke,"
