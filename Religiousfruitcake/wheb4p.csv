1,And this is a woman spouting this shit.
2,"Capitalism as we know it didn’t exist when the Bible was written, you twit."
3,"I don't know, maybe because those women also have useless husbands at home who don't do shit to help. Maybe that's why they are stressed."
4,"Um, maybe it's cause women who work are expected to do basically everything at home too? So maybe men need to step the fuck up"
5,"Do whatever you want my girl, but this chick loves going to work and loves her independence. My hubby loves it too! Each to their own."
6,"1. CDC from 2013 is dated, show me the update
2. Studies have shown that the reason women feel stressed at work more than men is due to different factors, some of which is societal shaming of of working mothers/guilt, women feeling they need to work harder than men, still shouldering the majority of child and home care aka child man syndrome"
7,My fiance (female) earns on average around 75% more than me (male) she just brings more bread to the table than me. How is it fair for a better worker than me with a better carrier than me to just sit home an cook and clean the house?
8,"""Women were created for the home,""  Okay, but why does God let so many women go homeless?"
9,"She forgot the part in the Bible where it says that women should stay silent, didn’t she?"
10,I go to work to get some rest.
11,This Lori woman is a danger to women.
12,I fucking hate this woman.
13,Nobody was created for the modern workplace. There is not one thing about about the current system that is even remotely natural.
14,Shut up Lori.
15,"Pretty sure God created Men and Woman to populate the Garden of Eden, before Eve ate the forbidden fruit of knowledge.

Which God also knew would happen, since he's omniscient."
16,"The issue here is not that women are incapable of working, the issues is that many employers overworkntheor workforce.

And that is regardless of gender."
17,That poor poor abuse victim posting that...
18,How can someone be this much against women empowerment while also being a woman...
19,"Lori Anderson spews all this stuff while skipping the part where she hired nannies for her kids and housekeepers for the chores. All that subservient hard work that she wants other women to do she was unwilling to do herself.

My wife used to follow FreeJinger and read me some of the breakdown of LA and her weird husband. That family is fucked up."
20,Ik it's even more sad.
21,"It's not a woman, it's a monster !"
22,Sounds like she just doesn't want to work
23,"What about drinking beer and watching football is useless?!
Maybe they should just pray more often /s"
24,"I was going to guess the extra stress was coming from sexist bullshit at work but yeah, your reason works too."
25,"My wife has a degree she uses to make more money than me but we're also paying off her loans. I assume this Transformer lady and her church is going to pay my wife's portion of our mortgage and my wife's student loan debt when my wife ""becomes a homemaker"" and we can no longer afford food on the 1/3 or so of our total income I earn. 

I'm just assuming if they want to force us to do that they're going to pay for it, right?"
26,Because God is worse at their job than these people are at being rational. And that’s saying a lot
