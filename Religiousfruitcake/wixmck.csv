13,"You want to get them mad?


Tell them if it lasts only a few seconds, they're not doing it properly. 


I tried it and it works..."
14,"But . . . without orgasms, how can we have more Christians to continue the cult? THE STUPID, IT BURNS!"

It’s kind of funny."
16,I will cum to this tweet out of spite.
17,"""Choose the cross"" ... My understanding was that involves slow death over days of pain, starvation, and dehydration. I'll take my few seconds of badly performed physical indulgence, thanks."
18,Wasn't one of Jesus' closest friends a prostitute? Do you think he forgave her transgressions or is she burning in hell with Judas?

33,They need some carian knights too set them straight
34,"Wow, such liberty!"
35,"Well, okay… you changed my mind. Buuuuuut, in all religions, why does it only apply to women and not men ? Why does “god” allow one’s sexual gratification and send others to “hell” ?"
36,"How the fuck are you going to make a kid tho? I mean, if You're a straight cis man, you have to have an orgasm to make a baby. So, basically all parents are going to hell..."
37,Their account is now suspended.
38,If Heaven existed that would be true. All you have is orgasms so you better have as many as you can.
39,It’s because they’ve never had one
40,It can be because they have so much pent up sexual frustration.
41,"against the thing he created, who would have thought"
42,"That's a very modern interpretation that has little biblical basis, essentially religious fanfic

Of course, the devil is barely mentioned in the Bible either, so that might not matter"
