1,"Thanks, Pastor Steve! This show looks hellsome!"
2,I adore the cherry picking.  Like the Bible is filled to the brim with awful narratives.
3,The comment section is full of these nutjobs. It is up to the parents to regulate what their children watch.
4,"Seems like a cartoon for adults like South Park etc, FX is pretty edgy, home of the amazing American Horror Story full of demons and witches etc. Disney has a hand in all  entertainment now, doesn't mean it's meant for kids or created by them. They suck though for that reason."
5,Panic over people treating fantasy stories as fantasy stories
6,"He should watch [The Owl House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W1FFiT51lg), his head would literally explode.

That is a show featuring a kid that is *meant for and age-appropriate for kids* that is absolutely chock full of stuff Christians hate, like inclusion, tolerance, LGBTQ+ representation, positive life lessons, allegories to disabilities and mental health issues, and--oh yeah--witchcraft and demons."
7,"Be Pastor in small town.

I believe but I'm not crazy like half my congregation.

Can't get a wink of sleep because the smallest thing will set these people off.

Margaret calls. It's serious.

There's a new show she's worried ""the children"" might watch and she's been calling me non-stop for 4 days about it.

Margaret doesn't have kids. She didn't even *like* kids.

Why tf did we make social media?"
8,"Saw it on YouTube. It‚Äôs marketed to adults as an edgy cartoon, ie South Park, Family Guy. Comments full of Christians losing their minds. The satanic panic is delightful."
9,"If you dont want your child to watch something just turn off the TV lmao. It's so annoying how these people act like they're entitled to control what kind of cartoons people are making. There are so many ""offensive"" cartoons out there that people aren't complaining about. If you don't like something just don't look at it, it's so simple"
10,Trailer can be seen here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmY4KsumM0
11,These Christians keep making me want to watch the show
12,Imma show them stuff like blue exorcist exists
13,"I feel bad for the people who find themselves incapable of enjoying cool stories and interesting content because of stupid reasons like this.

Like, obviously his kid shouldn‚Äôt watch anything like that until they ar wold enough, but it‚Äôs a damn cartoon for adults, it‚Äôs really just sad they can‚Äôt enjoy it."
14,"Jesus Fucking Christ, it‚Äôs not by Disney. It‚Äôs from FX on Hulu.

![gif](giphy|KUAb8YQOhmWNq)"
15,"I remember a time when I‚Äôd have agreed, word for word, with what this woman was saying *shudders*. Thank you, critical thinking and growth, for coming to me"
16,"It‚Äôs TV-MA and airs at 9:00 PM, I love how he intentionally misrepresents that it‚Äôs targeted at children"
17,Now that‚Äôs publicity
18,Didn‚Äôt know this existed will watch now.
19,It's an adult show from what I read. Not intended for children.
20,If you thinks that‚Äôs bad for the children you should see what‚Äôs in your fuckin Bible
21,"Ill take ""How to make even more people watch the show"" for 400 Alex."
22,Yay! Culture war bullshit! It's not like it's called Little demon and is in a streaming service you could just not use.
23,"It's on FX, or actually FXX, rated TV-MA.  For crying out loud.  And yes , Disney owns Fox.  But from what I can see, it's only the butt hurt religious folks that mentioning Disney.  They act like its airing on Disney junior right after Doc Mcstuffins.....

It is a absolutely not for young kids, so manage your own household.

I have enjoyed it so far!"
24,"Huh. I likely never would have heard of this without the good congresscritter's help. Looks rad. Like something my ten year old daughter will *adore*.

On it."
25,"I'm definitely going to watch this show now

Edit:

It's really fun totally recommend."
26,"I didn‚Äôt even know this was a cartoon that was being made but now I have to see it, it sounds badass"
27,It is clearly an adult cartoon. No ambiguity.
28,This show is awesome btw and so is the protagonist.
29,If you still have Facebook go and look at the comments for the ads.  So many idiots think demons are real and will corrupt their kids.
30,"""...and unpack pages of bible verses here...""

Yeah, please don't. The bible is what they had before animation was discovered and is an equally valid source of misinformation and fable.

Who IS this Louisiana congresscritter?"
31,They should watch Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.
32,I‚Äôm sure it would be fine if she triple murdered those bullies with a gun tho.
33,"Well now I wanna watch it, where is it?"
34,Btw this is not a kid show ever. Just because it is animated does not make it targeted at kids.
35,Big surprise‚Ä¶a comedy about the daughter of the devil is not popular with witch hunting fanatics
36,Never heard of it but this Karen makes it sound great!
37,I love how people get offened and start screaming/crying about an ADULT CARTOON because heaven forbid we have cartoons targeted to adults.
38,"""Shes a witch, shes jacked"" hell yeah"
39,Ya'll gotta watch out for them there cartoon demons. They're tricky bastards.
40,It‚Äôs funny seeing conservatives like her and Jack Posobeic get triggered over a cartoon that is supposed to be meant for adult audiences. (also I‚Äôm hooked on this cartoon since the first episode premiered)
41,Looks like an adult cartoon. Don't think you need to worry about kids watching it.
42,"FX should take this text, word for word, and have the voice cast of Little Demon (specifically Aubrey Plaza and Danny Devito, who play Chrissy‚Äôs parents, Laura and Satan) read it as an advertisement for the show. It would work so well."
43,"They say disney, but isn't this show on FXX? 

Idiots don't even know who to be mad at. It's not targeted to kids you bingle, it's on an adult comedy channel."
44,"Sorry but if you have a problem with pagans practicing their faith you should leave that to your god, obviously if he has an issue with them he‚Äôd give all the pagans cancer or maybe send a very precise flood, Yahweh seems to really like floods."
45,Hail Satan.
46,Thank you for binging this to my attention Congressman.  Now I have a new show to watch.
47,Do these people realize they are just promoting the show?
48,"Newsflash, not everyone cares about your religion."
49,I looked this up. Shows literally 18+ *facepalm*
50,This is the type of person who would search the Bible for a verse for each and every sentence they say
51,"I'm glad I became an atheist, so I can enjoy this show's take on mythology about the Antichrist without worrying about its effect on my supposed soul. It's funny to watch people take it so seriously."
52,They don't want people to realize how much more awesome hell is vs. Heaven.
53,"Kinda of off-topic, but does anyone think this looks bad? I thought it was a deviant art OC...

Also, don't let them know about Hazbin"
54,at least theyre going after something that has an actual connection to satan this time instead of leggings
55,"I did some digging. First of all; it's supposed to be for adults, and second, I'm honestly not very hopeful for it... Looks kind of unoriginal, but I haven't watched it so it might be good, who knows."
56,"Grew up in this type of culture. It taught you to be afraid of everything, including your own thoughts. I‚Äôm nearly 50 and I still don‚Äôt trust my intuition and instincts and live with a lot of shame. 

My mom wouldn‚Äôt allow me to watch He-man Masters of the Universe because there is only on true master of the universe - Jesus."
57,Sounds like I have a new cartoon to watch
58,Congressman: People are NOT fearing He‚Äôll anymore?! I better do something!!
59,11 year old? I‚Äôm pretty sure that kid has seen worst at trump rallies
60,Dog don't you have a state to run? Get back to work instead of malding over a cartoon. Complete manchildren
61,"I dare not imagine how he might react if he were aware of the existence of Hazbin Hotel, where one of the main characters is an Italian-born spider demon, gay porn actor, cocaine addict, who occasionally dresses up as a drag queen, and who has a demonic pig like pet that goes by the name of Fat Nuggets"
62,Cry more
63,It's always  wierd to be reminded that there are *real* people who  believe that demons exist and hell is an actual place under the ground.
64,Nice PR üëç
65,Mike Johnson is a public figure. Call him out!
66,Running to ad this to my list.
67,Classic Louisiana L(I live here)
68,He and his family doesn't have to watch it. If enough people don't watch it it'll be a flop and FX will cancel it. Why don't these people who believe in the invisible hand of the market and free choice let it do it's job? I'm not going to watch it. No because I care about the Antichrist but because I've been traumatized enough by religion and stupid horror (comedy) shows.
69,I like that more satanism and rebellion against Christianity is appearing in media. The world is beginning to heal from a 2000 year wound.
70,Why the fuck does somebody feel the need to hide the identity of a member of Congress?
71,"Ooh, sounds like a good recommendation for an anime?  

Banned media is so often the best."
72,"My dad started clutching his pearls about this show and how it was ‚Äúmade by Disney‚Äù. He typically twists things to suit his narrative, so I looked it up to see what he was bitching about.

It‚Äôs adult animated and DISTRIBUTED by Disney. The best comparison I could come how it is being pissed that Nintendo allowed Resident Evil to be played on the Switch because they also licensed pok√©mon. It‚Äôs not meant for kids. It was never meant for kids. And if you don‚Äôt like it, jsut don‚Äôt fucking watch it."
73,"Oh god 


Bottom picture is just modern cult of the lamb 


Anyway extremist is fucking insane"
74,"This sounds hilarious, can‚Äôt wait to see it.

Thanks Mr Congressman."
75,Wow! This made me really want to watch this! Sounds good!
76,"Man, this just makes me want to watch it more."
77,They make it sound so fucking dramatic every time lol
78,"Made out the shape of the blur and associated it with a name. This guy is the #4 House Republican. Sad, isn‚Äôt it?"
79,They‚Äôve been blaming Disney since forever. Parents need to take a role in their child‚Äôs upbringing. Offended by a cartoon? Don‚Äôt watch it and don‚Äôt ruin it for the rest of us who are grounded in reality.
80,Which Congressman?
81,Oh waaaaaaaah.
82,"I wonder if this guy was part of the ""Fuck your feelings"" crowd when Trump was elected?"
83,"I love this show so much, except for the nude stuff that's not my thing in anything, but this show is hilarious and im genuinely so happy I get to see it"
84,She sounds fun at a party
85,Why block the Congress critters name...public figure and all
86,"I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs not for kids. They aren‚Äôt showing this to kids, Becky."
87,"That's... Not that much of a ""freak out"".

They're quoting the show's actors/PR and reviews, then says it's the job of parents to be vigilant about what their children watch.

Which... Yeah ok, duh? The show isn't appropriate for kids. 

(Ye Ye Ye, couched their intro and end in religious words, but that doesn't constitute a ""religious freak out"")"
88,[deleted]
89,It‚Äôs not even Disney It‚Äôs HBO isn‚Äôt it? Also it‚Äôs an adult cartoon so just don‚Äôt let your kid watch it.
90,I didn't know Disney owned this.
91,It's almost like FX and Disney have two different target audiences.
92,that looks amd sounds amazing! Thanks mister congressman for the recommendation!
93,Well now I‚Äôm going to watch it out of spite.
94,There‚Äôre few things more ridiculous than having an imaginary friend in the sky. Having an imaginary enemy is one.
95,The problem is they think it's a kid's show because it's animated and by Disney
96,"‚ÄúWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Isaiah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5:20-21‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨"
97,"I am an atheist, but the fact that this show was made by Disney, who are usually so family friendly simply disturbs me. They‚Äôve truly gone off the deep end at this point. And I‚Äôm willing to bet it will be woke, just like everything else they‚Äôve made in recent years."
98,K crazy but the show does suck lmaoo
99,"""Freedom of speech"" bitch"
100,"This show seems like it's gonna suck, not because of the demonic and pagan stuff, it just seems like it won't be that fantastic."
