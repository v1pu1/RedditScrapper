1,"AHH THOSE GODDAM MOTHERFUCKERS

Adam and Eve could not have existed due to the genetic bottleneck. Not to mention, I was 6 when I realized this is bullshit. 

Repeat: 

#I WAS SIX YEARS OLD WHEN I REALIZED THIS IS BULLSHIT"
2,"How do we know it isn’t figurative, like all those parts about how you should stone people to death for working on the sabbath?"
3,"The woman that was created in Genesis could not have been Eve first of all, Eve was created from Adam's rib. The one mentioned in Genesis was created out of nothing.

 Also aren't there Young Earth Creationists who say the Earth is only like 6000 years old, so the dinosaur fossils were put into the Earth by God. And the dinosaurs actually never existed, or something."
4,"God may not lie, but every person that talks for God does."
5,"You can feel the insecurity seeping through “God, WHO DOESN’T TELL A LIE, told us…”"
6,God doesn't lie bro. His word is solid bro. God would never lie bro. He's not like that bro. You just don't get it bro. Smh my head
7,"Ok that's it. Pack it up guys, we're done."
8,"I'll be honest. This is without a doubt better than the people who say dinosaurs don't exist and were fabricated by ""evil"" scientists."
9,So that means Noah had T-Rexs on the arch?
10,"I mean.. at least they are willing to accept dinosaurs did exist. Pretty sure I read a conspiracy theory somewhere that people though the fossils were put there by people trying to trick us 😂🤣😂

Side note, I have a hat with Jesus riding a T-Rex that I love 😂"
11,I once had someone very earnestly tell me that dinosaurs were the results of Lucifer and his fallen friends doing evil DNA experiments to figure out a way to corrupt gods creation.  I haven't talked to that person in years but I'm going to guess that they probably became an antivaxxer
12,It was Adam and Steve!
13,"Well, there you go. Checkmate."
14,Well that answers that
15,where's Adam and Eve's fossils at tho?
16,Silly person.
17,You know the people that say this that Adam and Eve were walking amongst the dinosaurs I’ve never owned a reptile
18,"Dinosaurs were not stated to be present, nor were any descript animals depicted. They could have walked the earth with early evolutionary creatures for all we know.

So the bible is trustable as a source cause the bible/god says so? Well in my book Marcus the deity says kissing men is legal and he says it in his book of life and truth so it's totally true! He said it!! It can't be false OR inaccurate when he says it!!!"
19,Back when I went to church. They had a “dinosaur expert” come in and talk to the youth group about how dinosaurs don’t conflict with the Bible’s history. His reasoning was that “days” are different for god and that a day could be millions of years to god and that dinosaurs were made early in the day and humans at the end of the day.
20,There was also unicorns and leprechauns.
21,"In the simplified words of Chris Rock, god fucked up on the 6th day, and so on the 7th, he took a rest so he wouldn’t fuck shit up again, and that’s how Australia, humans and and those itchy ass clothing tags that you can never seem to fucking get off exist"
22,"So this logic invalidates their argument that any context or story could have been altered or changed over time as these stories were passed around before being written down, and also means that following this same logic, all we need to do is find one single thing that is presented as a fact, that isn’t true, to unequivocally disprove god, because if their god existed and was omniscient, and could never lie, AND his hand guided the writing of the bible which is his inerrant word, then just the existence of certain orchid seeds that are smaller than mustard seeds because if god cannot be mistaken, and cannot lie, and the bible is his inerrant word, than any simple contradiction in there immediately invalids it"
23,"> people lived with dinosaurs

If we count _Gallus gallus domesticus_, sure..."
24,Same. I didnt receive first communion because i was too argumentative in sunday school
25,I'm dumb what genetic bottleneck?
26,How did you know that at 6 years old?
27,[removed]
28,Wasn't that something they literally did though?
29,"Because personally believing in a young earth does not impact the way you live or interact with other people.

Stoning other humans does have an impact which is why they did mental gymnastics to justify that part as a metaphor for something."
30,"Allegedly, the first woman, and Adam's first wife, was Lilith. She was banished to Hell for wanting an equal relationship and asking if she could try being on top during sex. So, God got rid of her and created a subservient and submissive substitute. Then, apparently, God got mad when she did what she was told by the Devil even though her whole existence was meant to be to do what she was told without question."
31,No idea I've heard so much crud around this. Men walked with dinosaurs or dinosaur bones where put there by Satan to deceive humans. Insert any bs you like I suppose
32,"I always loved that theory, which would mean that this loving God is deliberately deceitful.  I have also heard that Satan created the fossils to trick us, which would then ascribe creation powers to Satan, also a no-no.  The idea that the Earth is only 6000 years old come from Jesus’ lineage from Adam found in Luke 3:23-38, but Jesus’ lineage is also found in Matthew 1 and they are different.  Given the difficulties with genealogies even in modern times the genealogy of Jesus was probably never meant to be accurate, only to show that Jesus, the Son of God, also descended from Adam.  There is physical evidence that humans and dinosaurs never coexisted and that the Earth is extremely old."
33,"I think the rhetoric is ""Fossils were put into the earth by satan to trick people away from god"" or some equally silly nonsense"
34,What are you talking about God doesn't lie he clames to be all good and merciful then proceeds to do the most deplorable shit.
35,![gif](giphy|vYGsUUBVbWVBC)
36,"Also, humans lie and it was humans that wrote the Bible. And if the Bible doesn't ""lie"" and it's all undeniable truth, then there are also dragons, unicorns, and multiple kinds of talking plants."
37,"Must have, he was told two of each animal."
38,"Fossils weren't staged by people to make other people believe in the lie that is dinosaurs, they were staged by Satan himself!"
39,"Well, that just would disprove the Bible (which is common sense it's not ""proven"" or ""facts"") not necessarily God. Even Jews, after the Old Testament, soon after looked back as was like, ""nah, there's a lot of fucked up shit in there,"" that's obviously paraphrased. That's when the Talmud was made, altering things, like, the Bible says if a woman is raped in the country the penance is her marrying the rapist and the father getting a payment from the rapist. They changed it to be, she NEVER has to marry the rapist, the payment is given to her, not her father, and she is still considered a clean virgin and it doesn't count as sex. It also says, never should religion have unchangeable rules. Times change, culture and time evolves, religion needs to as well. It's one of my favorite things about it. I don't know if there is a God, or more than one, or none, or something we never will ever even imagine. But as a Jew, I hate the Bible. I think it's crazy and dumb and insane. I could go on for days about it, I do not see it as any part of my faith. It clearly doesn't reflect me as a woman, it doesn't pass the Bechdel test, etc. I've read it, I studied it, I quote it for people who do use it as a defense for stuff, I've never seen someone be able really defend it. I wouldn't insult it without knowing it, so I read it throughly. I went to Christian school for a long time, years of Bible study. I've also read the Talmud, Koran, and many important religious texts of many faiths. I like having the full realm of comparisons. I respect people believing whatever they want, but when they use it to be ignorant or attack others or challenge anyone else's beliefs, I'm happy to point out they are being such."
40,"Only Adam and Eve were created, meaning their children would HAVE to breed. That wouldn't be too awful, but after a few generations almost everyone would be severely deformed."
41,Inbreeding
42,"I read a book about dinosaurs, realized millions of years is longer then the day or so non-human animals were allegedly around, and put 2 and 2 together."
43,Let's see you prove that God is real.
44,"I'm not mad at god because I'm ""in love with my sins"" I'm mad at god for a lot of reasons. I'm mad at god because he was a major contributing factor in me hating myself for years, damage I'm still undoing, I'm mad at god because his text made me feel guilty for being bisexual, and caused me to repress myself for four years. God is a petty and egotistical thing, if he even exists, if people choose to believe in one of many other religions with equal possibility of being real instead of his he damns you to all eternity, and if you guess right, you're ability to feel anything other than happy is taken away as you worship at his feet for eternity alongside the cherubim and seraphim which seemingly exist for that exact reason as well.

God set adam and eve up to fail with full knowledge, then decided to sacrifce himself to himself to appease himself so he could forgive sins, and what are sins? Things that god has decided to be offended by. The bible is fucking stupid and full of contradictions because it was written by a hundred different people over 1000's of years, it's a book of morality without any morals and only exists so you can impose your opinions on other religious people who haven't formed theirs yet. All it's ever done is spread hate and fuck up other, more interesting, mythologies.

Don't act all high and mighty because you believe in god, it means nothing, and it means less than nothing to people who don't believe in it. I understand it, I really do, you want to believe you're special, that there is someone or something that loves you out there, even if no one else does, that there's something certain after death, because it's comforting, I understand that, I really do. It's why I remained religious for so long, and if you want to keep believing for that comfort fine, but don't write off people's reasons like that, religion made me scared to smile for three months because I thought god wouldn't forgive me over something inane and harmless. You can love yourself a hell of a lot more than god can."
45,"What happened to god makes no mistakes? 

Also Lilith was the true MVP."
46,"Ok honestly from a story telling perspective this is pretty solid lore, like that fills in some gaps in that story. For a belief system I make everyday descicons through. Not so much though.."
47,Man I missed this story all my life.
48,Everyone forgets about Lillith.
49,I mean he did make Abraham (maybe?) straight up think he was going to have to kill his son before he pulled the rug out from under him. So I’d say he is pretty damn deceitful.
50,You think I do that? Shiiiiiit.
51,"“Well that’s hard for me to explain therefor those were metaphors. Gays however, they should be killed, that’s literal yeah. Don’t eat shrimp? … uhhh I’m gonna go with metaphor. Women aren’t equal? oh well that’s literal of course. Let’s see, don’t wear two different types of fabric? I’m gonna go with…. Metaphor. “

I would say this is how they *think*, but that’s the problem, they just don’t think."
52,"2 magical liopleurodons too, Chaaaarleeey!!"
53,"Well, the problem with the bible having errors is that Christianity states it is the inerrant word of god. If you invalidate this claim, it causes a few problems with a religion based entirely on it. If you don’t invalidate that claim, you still have to accept that the contents, and all the problems therein, are objectively what your religion stands for.


Personally I also kinda have trouble reconciling the idea of an omniscient deity that is also not immutable. 



If you’re omniscient, you have perfect knowledge of everything that has happened, will happen, and could happen, and knowledge of all other things. If you have this perfect, dietic knowledge, does it not stand to reason that any decisions or opinions that god holds, could never change? There is no information or action that could be added to this situation to change gods stance on these things, as he already knew them when they were determined. There’s no revelation that would change the playing field, no action that would have him reconsider, that he didn’t already consider already.



And if gods is immutable, shouldn’t anything based off of his word be as well? I don’t understand how a religion can change its teachings and rules, while still claiming to follow the teachings of their god. If what your church teaches changes when gods word cannot, are you really still following the same religion?




Note: I don’t say this in defence of traditionalism, I do believe that if religion is to remain part of society, it does need to update with that society, I just have trouble reconciling how it can do so, and yet still claim to follow their gods values, if those should be immutable."
54,Actually if i remember correctly eve didn't have any daughters with adam so that means her and her son's had to inbreed which if im not mistaken would make the inbreeding worse
55,How did you determine which of the two timeframes/hypothesies was true though?
56,"I designed a Lilith costume for Halloween year before last. Because there isn't any blueprints to follow and the concept is so open-ended, I had a lot of fun with all wild details, had a corset and all kinds of glitter and crazy make-up. If I could dress like that everyday, I would. But I loved making that costume and I loved the final product. I also have a t-shirt that says ""always be a Lilith, never an Eve""

While I hate Hulu, they did make a good movie called *Pure* that's a scary movie that takes places at a father/daughter purity ball and it has a theme around Lilith. It was a good movie. The concept of purity balls are horrifying to begin with and far creepier then most fictional aspects of creepy movies. Leatherface would look at a purity ball be like, ""damn, that's gross and unnatural."""
57,Well it's in your book so yea I think you do that shiiiit lol
58,"Reminds me of Bo Burnham's song Rant,

When God, in verse 45, said the slaves are okay to buy 

He meant that people, all from the start 

Each have slaves within their hearts

&#x200B;

Things, that we have sold or boughten, that are forced to pick our moral cotton 

God calls us to set these free, free our hearts from slavery 

And then as God goes on to explain the logistics of buying and selling slaves..."
59,"Again, the Bible is one religious text, and not everyone follows, believes, or accepts it. Many Christians don't believe the Bible is the word of God, and that it was written by men and a reflection of its time. Also, the entire Old Testament, the Torah, is written without vowels or punctuation. No one knows what it really says and it will forever be greatly debated. The translation also changes things, especially when you're translating a text and then translating again from that translation and then again from that one and so on. It's like making a copy of a copy, it gets further from the true image the more it's copied. For example, there are no male pronouns or reference to gender in the story of Adam and Eve before Eve was created. Adam was never called a man, he, him, or whatever else. And religion often adapts. When Judaism first started we had 2 Gods, Yahweh and Asherah, who was God's wife. However, some men started having problems with the idea of a female God, so she started fading from the lore. I believe more of what you're saying would really only be that linear if everyone of Judeo-Christian faiths believed the Bible to be the word of God, and unadaptable. There are many ways of viewing a possible omnipresent being and they can be both believed and questioned at the same time. They can also adapt and evolve in or around faith. The Bible There is likely no one on Earth strictly adhering to all the rules listed in it, people pick and chose, interpret, and debate on much of it. Sometimes they say ""this is literal and that is figurative"" or whatever other excuse. You can also use story telling as a way to pass ideas of moral guidance. Personally, I don't think killing your children for talking back is a great lesson on morality, but the concept of having those lessens presented as fanciful stories is a tradition that dates for before the Bible, or even religion as a whole. Aesop's Fables have magical elements, talking animals, and imaginary concepts, but they were made for each to tell a story and teach a lesson. Those are generally better lessons, but many view it as the same inanition. You can be Christian and not believe in the Bible, and most don't think it is entirely the literal word of God. There is also many ways to practice various faiths and not everyone of the same religion shares the same views. For example, the people who wrote and read this asinine dinosaur book. They're Christians, but most Christians don't believe this, some believe dinosaurs never existed and Satan planted fossils to test our faith, some believe in evolution and science, so believe other things entirely. They are all Christian, but they're interrupting things in different ways. I believe in a higher power, and again, I could be wrong about literally all of it, but my view is that God made the universe, the universe led to the Big Bang, that led to life, that led to evolution and the development of life, all the the things science says happened, I just believe there may be a higher power that created the start. I also personally believe God gave us freewill. If she interfered in our lives, it's not freewill. I don't think God has ""opinions"" or makes any of our ""decisions."" Creating something doesn't automatically mean controlling it. Just like I don't blame God for giving someone cancer, I don't think God is responsible for someone beating cancer. Humans developed lots of great things, some had repercussions, other things were created that were not so great. We invented cigarettes, they came with baggage, people did the creating and people caused the repercussions of that creation. I don't believe God did either of it, not the making of them or the suffering caused by it. If I, like the majority of people in the world, don't believe there is a specific singular piece of writing that is the direct word of God, than there are no rules directly from one, and therefore it's humans interpreting what they believe. Humans are flawed, we aren't perfect, no one is. If we create something as imperfect beings, it stands to reason that creation is also not perfect. I the Bible was written by humans, who are imperfect, then there can be no perfect rule stated in it. There can be no religious law that can be unalterable or redesigned. Again, that could be entirely wrong, there could be nothing, there could be more, there could be a mix and match, I don't know. I only know I believe in science, facts, reality, common sense, freewill, and happen to also believe in a God. Like I said, one of the things I love about my faith as a Jewish person, is that our religion states there can be nothing that can't be questioned or evolved. There is no ""immutable"" word of God to most people. Most people believe the Bible was written by humans, some believe it to be the literal word of God, but they aren't the majority and they aren't even the majority of Christians. If there is no ""immutable"" word of God, then religion can, and has to, evolve and have multiple religious truths and beliefs and texts and they can be viewed or practiced differently or interpreted differently. They are practiced and interpreted differently by people at the same time. The way people practiced Christianity 100 years ago isn't the same as today, they way my Christian neighbor to the left practices it is different then the way my Christian neighbor to the right practices. They are both of the same faith, but have different understandings of that faith. As long as they aren't using it as an excuse for ignorance or to hurt anyone else (such as teaching children really idiotic concepts that harm their education and undermining facts with ""don't question it, just do it""), I honestly couldn't care if they thought One Fish Two Fish was written by the hand of God."
60,Oh yeah... Almost as if it's made up lol
61,"So this has always confused me.  So she has sons with Adam, then we're saying she had sex with her sons because she was the only woman.... but if she had daughter's by having sex with her sons they are STILL her daughters (and her granddaughters, lol). In other words, if Eve didn't have daughters there is no human race after she dies.

The whole Adam/Eve story is just one mess after another."
62,"You're undermining the power of God. He made sure the Bible was full of unbelievable stories, because like Jesus said, you need to become like a child, have the faith of a child to enter the Kingdom of God. It weeds out a lot of prideful people, because it insults your intelligence. 
But what happens when you find out it's all real?"
63,"I don't remember exactly how, but it was along the lines of ""we found dinosaur bones, but not the Garden of Eden. ""

So, I brought this up with my mom, and she was flabbergasted. She said for God 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is 1 day, and since He wrote the bible, the ""day"" could be a long time. 

I still thought God created them, but on different time scale because I was raised to think that way."
64,"Two sides to every coin, my friend. There's me.. and there's.. you know who."
65,"Holy shit, Bo has some great stuff on religion! The song “gods perspective” basically converted one of my friends away from Christianity lol"
66,Thankfully it's made up. Because if it wasn't thats disgusting and we'd all look like blobs of deformed flesh
67,Well the daughters she does have is from her son's not adams in total she had like 93 kids i think my knowledge on the bible is rusty. But yes she does have daughters just not with adam which makes the inbreeding much much worse
68,When Cain was expelled he went and found a wife in the land of Nod and lived with the *rest of the people*.
69,"Well first i dont believe in god so thats ans issue. Second im aware there is no higher power in the universe. Third i have proof for my set of beliefs that cannot be destroyed by 3 seconds by a 7th grade drop out. 4th the Bible was written 2000 years ago by someone who can't make a cohesive story, in which the book contradicts itself so many times. 5th i was 4 years old(the first time inwent to church) when i realized the bible was bullshit. 6th im gay and many believers of your religion thing im an abomination who needs to be killed. Even though gay wasn't included in the bible until 1946 influenced by Hitler's beliefs believe it or not. I'm not following a religion influenced by Hitler.

Even if your bullshit religion is true I don't want any part in it I'll burn in hell. Evey time i step foot near a church or church event or when a Christian or Catholic person prays for me bad shit happens. Why would believe in a religion after getting sexually assaulted by someone who preaches it.  

Oh and if god exists theres no way he told noah to put 2 cockroaches on the arc or 2 wasps(the ones that lay eggs in caterpillars). Just no way god said yeah put those horrific creatures on that boat it'll be fine.

Plus just to mention the earth is older than 6000 years old and isn't flat just another inconsistentcy in the bible so you cant fully follow god without being a new earth creationist and flat earther. Which im a bit smarter than that"
70,"I'm sure you can tell, I'm one of the people this sub is making fun of. Except I'm not a religious fruitcake, I'm a Jesus nut. And very proud of it."
71,Thanks for replying. An interesting insight.
72,You know who makes more sense though. Trying to free the people from mental bondage and fascist dictatorship. I like that guy
73,93 kids and no epidural.  No wonder it was called a curse.
74,You're welcome
75,Hail Satan!
76,"Yeah no shit but st the same time the More kids you have the less time labor takes and the less painful it is. You see it a few times on ""i didn't know i was pregnant"" women with kids have hidden pregnancies and labor goes relatively fast thankfully. But ues definitely a curse"
77,Satan is indeed pretty fuckin awesome!
78,"Do you watch with Mama Doctor Jones?  If not, you might want to check her out.  I love her reaction videos to ""I didn't know I was pregnant"".  

I've had an ablation and my tubes were removed for endometriosis, and that show makes me paranoid, lol."
79,Actually yes i do watch mama doctor jones. I was actually referencing her most recent video on i didn't know i was pregnant.
80,The one with good acting... and a toilet?  That was a great one.
81,"Yes, and yes it was a great episode"
