1,"It’s not a religion? That’s good enough for me, Christian churches can be stripped of any tax exemptions and pay taxes now. Awesome 🤩"
2,Christianity is a death cult.  Just look at their mascot - a dead guy on a stick.
3,"It’s extortion, blackmail and quid pro quo all the way down, and who asked for any of it.  But I guess some people view that as a “relationship”."
4,"I'd rather be single then. 
Also; evolution is not science? What is it then? A fairytale?"
5,The existence of disease variants is proof of evolution
6,"God I hate that phrase so much. You have a deity, you worship it, it’s a religion case closed."
7,"> Every single religion out there is all about good deeds and earning your way to heaven.

Did they study each of those religions in-depth in order to arrive at such a general statement?"
8,I love it when Christians take a break from their full schedule of being shitty to everyone so that they can remind us how their religion is not about being kind to people or doing good works in the world. What a dirtbag theology.
9,"That's a very ignorant view on the world's religions. So many religions out there don't even profess a heaven or don't profess them as the final destination. There are whole Dharmic schools even propose that even the most Enlightened and Liberated won't necessarily escape natural cosmic cycle and that once a universe ends, they too will end and be absorbed back to chaos to become anew with the next universe. The world's religious beliefs and views are extremely diverse in their cultural backgrounds, mythos, cosmology, tenets and philosophy (or lack thereof) that they can't ever be lumped into a ""do good deed"" dough, and thus, these zealots have no ""relationship with god"" ground to look down upon them. But then, it's to be expected of zealots."
10,"Problem with that example is that god is both the judge and prosecutor, as well as the lawmaker.

He made the law and will prosecute you if you don't feel grateful when god pays the fine to himself."
11,Or a cult 1/2 dozen 6 same thing
12,I've heard this argument verbatim from many Christians. It's so stupid and arrogant.
13,"You just have to ask forgiveness for being born with the something you had no control over (original sin), then you have to follow ten rules or 613 maybe lower depending on your denomination. Also you have to pray on your sabbath day and your better not work if you're all for that old testament train ride because you're liable for a death sentence. So yea just normal relationship and not a religion at all."
14,So if god has already forgiven us then why does he continue to send people to hell?
15,"They would say so, because they don't understand it"
16,"That's the thing, we *can* observe evolution, in bacteria"
17,"Nah it's a pretty accurate view of Christianity, specifically. Ya know, from the eyes of one of their cult members."
