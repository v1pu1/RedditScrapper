1,"What these people refuse to understand is that this argument falls flat because you can actually contact and speak with the people that built snowmen, houses, paintings, etc"
2,If the snowmen don’t bow down and honor us we will melt and destroy them in a manner that will last for all eternity. Because we love them.
3,"Anyone who doesn't think evolution is real is a fucking idiot.

You can have your own opinions but you can't have your own facts. 

Evolution is a fact. Not an opinion."
4,"Okay but this doesn't solve anything.  If the snowmen couldn't evolve, where did the entity who made them come from? It's a never ending cycle"
5,I want to see these two survive and reproduce
6,I can't imagine being so dumb as to think that meme is a valid argument in favor of intelligent design.
7,Pretty sure I've received this in an email from my grandma
8,"Okay, now they're just creating a *snowman* argument"
9,"If we don’t worship our creator we will melt in hell forever. Please forgive us even though we are not worthy. 

In the name of the solid, the liquid and the holy gas, amen."
10,"""don't be absurd! nobody made us! we were always there!"" 
  
   - god(s)"
11,"This cartoon doesn’t mean what they think it means. 

If snow fell continuously for 3.5 billion years then yeah, a snowman would definitely appear somewhere at some point. 

If millions of years of wind and water can make a rock that looks like an elephant, then billions of years of snow can form a snowman at least once. 

Now imagine that snowman can reproduce other snowman and voila, evolution."
12,I love when people feeling smug about not understanding the evolution.
13,"If a group of researchers had a chain of evidence that all fit into a theory that we were crafted by an intelligent being, and the same didn't exist for the theory of evolution, I would believe we were most likely created by an intelligent being."
14,"super incredibly long rambling below cause I'm drinking and waiting for a ride impatiently you don't have to read just ignore me:

Imagine thinking the snow you organized into a shape with no organic functions, sentience, or sapience is an apt metaphor. Actually, you know what, let's roll with it. Here's a fake dialogue since we're burning brain cells, just me curious as to what response those who agreed with that image on facebook would be:

>You made the snow people? What about the bugs and stray mammals roaming about? The plants? Did you make those No?

>So there are things that exist that you, the snowman creator, didn't make?

>Ok, then, according to your own logic, since you're the actor for God here in this metaphor: God does exists, but it still didn't make people, the animals, the plants or anything else on this planet or in our solar system. It's on the other side of the universe making shapes, so i guess who knows where the rest of the life around its shapes came from

>No, no, I'm not confused, I get what you think you're saying. You made a shape with no effort that barely looks like a person, just like god made people that barely looks like it, and the snow people think their pieces fell together by accident just like humans think their pieces evolved piece by piece by accident. And since you're a shitty person that made living feeling snow people and then abandoned them to melt horrific deaths because ""who cares its just snow,"" your shitty god abandoned you to rot and die in misery on this rock because 'who cares its just flesh'

>So either god makes life and abandons it because we're just shapes to it or we exist outside of gods useless shape-making and the life around us is from something else entirely.

>That's not what you're saying after all? Make a better metaphor then I'll wait.

and yes, I know this wouldn't do any convincing, it's not supposed to. it's supposed to ridicule dumb analogies. I'm pretty confident I know how they'd dismiss me and what insults they'd use. But I still want to know what the actual response is and not just my preconceived notion. The point of the snowmen comic is the same Paley's watchmaker, I get it, but my argument with that was always

1.) you don't actually know what you'd think of a watch if you'd never seen or heard of one before and didn't know something called a watch or a watchmaker existed, especially if you decided to call them watches and their makers watchmakers, and they were found everywhere on the ground in the wild in observationally patterned designs that differed between climates and locations, and no matter what you did or how you did it you could never find the watchmaker who made them. you could form a cult called the watchmakians and make up stories about the mysterious watchmaker, but why assume a maker just because you don't understand how they're made? You only assume you would think they were built because you're biased by already knowing what watches are, what they do, who made them, and why. It's kind of like thinking a ballmaker meticulously shaped the concretions in New Zealand and in California and in the arctic.

2.) you find a watch and believe in the watchmaker and finally through a lot of spiritual journeying you finally meet the watchmaker, or at least their assistant (as the watchmaker has a penchant for murdering guests) and you ask why they made knives. Simple! They didn't! They make watches! So you seek out the knife maker and you watch them make a knife, and they use a piece of leather for the handle... but who made the leather? So you find the leathermaker smoothing the leather with a tool. Who made the tool? Well, no one made the tool, its a piece of bone from a hog. Who made the hog? The hogmaker? Oh, god, gods the hogmaker. Who made people? ... GOD?? and the trees? GOD???? people can have multiple crafts, sure, a leatherworker can make the leather for the knives he smiths and tinkers with watches as a hobby, but god ONLY has the crafts you can't explain. that doesn't seem a little juvenile? i can't figure it out, must have been god.. until you figure it out, then it wasn't god it was a watchmaker. but the gears of the watch are made by god, they're clearly designed and we don't know where.. oh a gearmaker, well the pure fine gold was a gift directly from god..... oh a metal worker? All the way down to ""well god put the ore in the Earth's crust then right next to the dinosaur rocks that the lava god with fangs put down""

TL;DR: did you really scroll down here for a tldr, i said ignore me if you didn't want to read"
15,"And yet, your fucking toaster or mold on the wall can make an image of white Jesus and that’s totally reasonable."
16,Vanillite would like to know your location
17,The one difference is that snowmen can see their creators build other snowmen.
18,People who follow a book featuring a talking donkey calling evolution absurd… K.
19,At least I don't melt the snowmen I make if they don't obey me
20,People have to comprehend that it takes literally fuckton of time (millions of years) for humans to form through evolution but they keep expect it to happen in matter of thousands of years
21,"Apparently believing in the Big Bang, in evolution, in science is absurd and rediculous even though there is much evidence and proof to back them (according to religious folks)

BUT

Believing in Muhammad flying to heaven on a winged horse, Adam and Eve spawning from heaven, Jesus dying and being resurrected, etc 
is not absurd because ""th0sE are MiRaCLeS""!"
22,"This is the intellectual level of creationists, and is exactly why there's no point in engaging with them."
23,"It is quite funny, though, if you use the modern meaning of snowflake :)"
24,Holy  Crap....JW'S are going to have a field day with this one.
25,The problem is that they can’t imagine how evolution works. They can’t conceptualize billions of years.
26,"If you give the snowflakes an infinite amount of time, theoretically, yes they couldn't build a snowmam by themselves lol. That's besides the point tho."
27,Snowmen don’t have organs
28,i don't understand what life is therefore evolution is dumb
29,Humans regularly bite their tongues. There is no way an intelligent designer created us...
30,"Snow could pile up and coal or rocks could end up in those positions. Remove the man made fabrics and there is a chance of randomly arriving at a snowman.

No one ever said life or this form of it will evolve easy or that there are not billions of planets with life that failed or we do not know there billions of failed life that happed here.

We only ever see the successful version."
31,Huh
32,Ah yes the sentient snowman argument.
33,"I once met a super sweet and kind Christian girl, who I am friends with but sorta awkward around regarding religion, who attempted to ""gift"" me a copy of this very outdated book that attempts to ""disprove"" the idea of evolution in favor of the Bible. What's the whole deal with complaining about evolution?? This book had tons of faulty arguments and disproven information too, and it was published long ago. Around the same time period, I met another guy who wrote an entire document about why he thinks evolution is wrong and I'm just like- Just because science has not fully proven EVERYTHING and that everything hasn't been fully discovered or researched doesn't mean that trusting science is a foolish thing to do. 

Needless to say, I returned the book after reading it."
34,That's quite funny tbh
35,"Well, that's the clincher."
36,Fragile snowflake lol
37,"xtians believe humans are made of compressed dust, so...."
38,Except I can see the person making them. Btw I just love it when flesh rains down from the sky so god can make flesh men
39,Humans are god. Cool. Reply with your favourite moment that definitively proves that you are an omnipotent entity.
40,"What drives me nuts about this is that their answer doesn't really resolve the problem. It just kicks the can. If a human is so complex that it requires a creator, then surely an omnipotent and omniscient being is even more complex and so must also require a creator right? If God can appear from nothing, then why not our universe?"
41,….and they think they are soooo clever.
42,"One thing I've always wondered was if we evolved by chance from the primordial soup and there's no grand design for us, why does that bother people? 

Legit question btw"
43,"When Frosty the Snowman is one of the few ""secular"" Christmas cartoons you're allowed to watch, thinking snowpeople are sentient becomes a fetish for some, I guess.

Also, the song was sung by a nasty racist, so there's that."
44,"Why do they always think evolution happens by chance?

I mean it's literally the exact opposite of that."
45,You can literally witness evolution on a daily basis. Caterpillars evolve into butterfly/moths. PREGNANCY is literally a form of evolution for fucks sake. This snowman argument is asinine
46,That and you can watch evolution in progress in organisms that reproduce frequently and have short generational gaps. Usually small things like bacteria and fruit flies
47,There’s multiple reasons why this falls apart.  They don’t understand evolution so they can’t help but strawman it.
48,"Fr, analogies are always upto scrutiny and criticism especially if they are as bad as this."
49,This picture makes me unreasonably mad.  Well done.
50,"And also in the infinite timeline of existence, you can absolutely randomly wind up with 3 balls of snow and some crap jammed into them."
51,"Oh, they believe they can communicate with their creator."
52,We better murder our kids for their salvation and to prove our love for them.
53,"Bullshit, invisible man in the sky made us 6000 years ago."
54,My dad doesn’t “believe” in evolution and I agree he is an idiot. He didn’t pay taxes for like seven years. So yes very dumb.
55,"While I agree, technically most of us are reading about the proof of evolution, just like how religious ppl read their special books. 

1) I personally have never found a dinosaur bone, nor have I personally checked that the bones in a museum are real.

2) Carbon dating is also something that I personally cannot prove. 

3) There are religious books that also tell me stuff that I cannot personally prove. 

So I can see why there are people that don’t believe in evolution because at some point all of us are relying on books to tell us facts.

So I try to use logic when determining what to believe. Tons of scientists telling me stuff sounds a lot more realistic than a book called the Bible that was written a long time ago when people barely knew anything."
56,"Just going to play devils advocate for a quick minute:  
  
Isn't evolution *technically* still a theory?   
  
Edit: I 100% believe in evolution. Guess I should've led with that"
57,Have you heard of astro Terry?
58,They appear to both be snowMEN. They'll melt in hell for all eternity.
59,Pervert!

62,eeeeyyy 👉👉
63,"Even if we were created by some kind of being:  
There is plenty of evidence that this being does not give a single crap about you or your prayers or how ""morally correct"" you behave"
64,Ah you fucker you got me.
65,I don’t need much of an excuse to post [this](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/amp/entry/dog-bottom-jesus-sighting_n_3440005/)
66, Not to mention their dog's butthole randomly looking like jesus.
67,"Get your facts straight 

Adam was made from dust, and Eve from his ribs!

Christianity 1 - Evil-lutionists 0"
68,They are no different to flat earthers.
69,"Not really? You can witness evolution but what you are talking about is just development within a life cycle, evolution is across generations"
70,That's... not how it works
71,"That's what I always say about their watchmaker argument.

""suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place...There must have existed...an artificer or artificers, who formed \[the watch\] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer"" - William Paley

They use other versions of this about the complexity of ecosystems or animals.

To that my answer is, actually if I found a watch with similar circumstances to what led us to theorize evolution; I could see that it could replicate itself, and I found ways it could gather the needed components to reproduce and continue it's own existence, and then I found a series of older watches with increasing complexity that could have reasonably made themselves and their progressively more complex offspring, YES I would think the watch occurred by nature."
72,"Evolution has been observed multiple times in the past hundred years. [Here's 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM), for example."
73,"""Muhh but microevolution is different than macroevolution"""
74,Check and mate liberal those are obviously snowmen! /s
75,We must also torture them for eternity if they dont love us back and are not grateful that we murdered our kids.
76,"Sky daddy loves me and gave me my stupid spin, intelligent design my ass"
77,Is your dad Kent Hovind?
78,My taxes aint gonna fund colleges where they teach lies like evolution!!
79,"The major difference is the power of explanation/prediction. Even if I don't went back to prove the source of knowledge, I can use the distilled knowledge to explain/predict things. Even subjects that don't directly screamed EVOLUTION.

Like how shallots and garlics got so big in recent memory, the advent of new diseases, animal breeds, etc."
80,Just look at a dog bro theres your proof
81,"A scientific theory, and a layman’s theory are two distinct separate things. A scientific theory is as close to fact as possible, but scientists will always say we don’t know 100 percent"
82,"Actually, no.  Many specific instances of have been observed.  During the industrial revolution, for instance, a previously white moth evolved to blend in with the gray-black soot produced by burning coal.  When the air cleared up, it re evolved as white again.  This happened over many decades, but was clearly documented.   Of course insects, because of their quicker generational cycle, evolve much faster than mammals.
Edit:  Another example is resistance to malaria.  It has been well documented that overcthe last few hundred years indigenous people in certain areas of Africa have developed increased resistance to malaria.  This is not an adaptive form of resistance based on a response to infection in utero or otherwise, but an innate form.  They are born with it."
83,Don't we have fossils of earlier humans? Or almost humans? How is it not a fact?
84,"A theory is as proven as you can ever get

There is also the theory of gravity, the theory of relativity. It's never 1000000% guaranteed, its a theory because it is open to being better understood, but a theory is as good as it gets"
85,"Yes it is still *the* Theory since it hasn’t been disproved. But like Newtonian Physics and Bohr model of the atom, if it is ‘disproven’ it would be more that the underlying system m works differently and more complexly than previously l thought, so it would still be a true/accurate abstraction/simplification."
86,"Evolution is a theory in the scientific sense. Which means it's on stronger ground than most ""facts.""

Common descent of all life on earth is essentially settled science. ""Old earth"" is settled. Where religious people have some wiggle room is the origin of life in the first place. It's God of the Gaps, sure, but ultimately almost every argument for God always has been, it's just that the gaps were basically massive for most of human history. Now not as much.

However, as Ken Ham and other creationists love to point out, the deity presiding over millennia of survival of the fittest would be a fundamentally different being than we see depicted in the Bible. Which I think is accurate as well. The only difference in Ken and I is I resolve the tension by rejecting the religious claim instead of rejecting the claims of evolution."
87,Same as germ theory and gravity. Yes.
88,"Yes, it's ""still a theory"", i.e. the highest standard of certainty in science. Like the theory of gravity or germ theory."
89,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0H-amOti\_o
90,https://www.notjustatheory.com/
91,"A scientific law describes what will happen in a given situation as demonstrable by a mathematical equation such as the law of gravity which is defined by the equation  F = G × [(m1m2)/r2]. A scientific theory describes how the phenomenon happens, but can not be calculated by the means of a mathmatical equation."
92,Our education system has failed
93,"Not to pile on here, but if you ""believe in"" evolution, you're doing it wrong.  Science demands doubt.  You don't believe in a scientific theory anymore than you believe in a recipe for cake.  If you use the recipe, and you get cake, then the recipe is correct.  Sometimes, recipes are so obvious that you don't need to make the cake to know it works.  That doesn't mean you believe in the recipe, or trust the baker.  You looked at the recipe, it made sense, so you think it makes a cake.  

Sometimes, and this is the fun part, a new recipe is discovered, or an old recipe that everyone thought made cake actually doesn't work under specific circumstances.  Then you get to try to figure out why the things everyone thought were true actually are misunderstandings of reality.  

Evolution is supported by all of the evidence we have, and is not challenged by any of the evidence we have.  And if it were disproven tomorrow, it would be the greatest scientific discovery of our lifetimes."
94,"Guys, he is playing Devil's Advocate. No need for the down votes."
95,yes. so is gravity. just keep that in mind. gravity is a theory.
96,Many of the commenters replying to this are mostly right but it would be better to call a scientific theory a *body of knowledge* surrounding a specific topic. Such as the theory of gravity being a compilation of discoveries that form our modern understanding of gravity.
97,Evolution is a fact. Evolution by natural selection is the theory.
98,"There is no such thing as ‘still a theory’ in science. Theory doesn’t evolve into something else

Theory is the in depth explanation of natural phenomena"
99,they don't seem angry
100,Not everything can be intelligently designed. Not everything must be. We can all agree on that. *smokes peace pipe*
