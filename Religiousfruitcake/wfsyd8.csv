1,"Loving thy neighbor and not judging them is literally what Jesus told you to do. You Christian coonts

Christians personal beliefs outweigh Jesus lol.

Remember everyone. When you see a Christian not loving thy neighbor and judging them.

Just call them an anti christ. Keep circling back to the love thy neighbor, they ain’t god,stop judging Satan"
2,"That's the last contact I would have with that provider, except to tell them exactly why I'm going elsewhere."
3,Get a different doc. Most I know could care less about religion
4,"Why did you even have to explain why you need it?? The doctor and your medical record should clearly indicate why you need it. 

Join the Satanic Temple, then you can sight that it's against your religious liberty form them not to replace it. If they still don't, you sue the life out them."
5,"Ahhh good ole oppression and not freedom, is this the great america they wanted(yes it is)"
6,Note: I found this post in the wild.
7,"If your religion prevents you from offering quality care then get a different job. Go work in your church, become a nun, whatever. But let healthcare be done by those who are there to care."
8,"If you are a minority(not cis, white, xtian, hetero, male) get out of Texas…"
9,Texas is absolute shit for women's health. Might as well be called rapeville
10,"This is why I'm don't think I'll be seeing any doctors who have deeply held religious convictions, I don't need my health getting screwed up because of their religious beliefs."
11,couldn't*
12,"Couldn't you sue her as is? I mean, you're probably paying a lot of money for her to simply refuse to treat you for no good reason."
13,"Fyi nobody has yet to win a case citing the Satanic Temple as a reason they need abortion. In theory it sounds good though.
Edit: THIS ISNT ME CONDONING THE OVERTURN OF ROE V WADE, let me make that clear. Many people act like they can depend on the Satanic Temple in the event of an emergency when there is no proof that will solve anything."
14,"I don’t disagree, but this is very hard for people who don’t have the means."
15,*could
16,Probably. Doc could also have their license suspended for that.
17,"Thanks for playing, I appreciate your time however FYI religious liberty works both ways. The law not specific to Christianity. So stating your religious conviction as why you should not be denied the procedure and then not receiving said procedure is a violation of your religious liberty. So yes, you sue the fuck out them for violating YOUR religious liberty.....

18,"That’s not the point, the point is that the Satanic Temple suits (regarding abortion and other issues) have very low success rates. This is obviously a problem and heavily influenced by Christian bigotry, but pointing out that it’s a problem isn’t condoning it."
19,"Woah there. Maybe i'm reading your tone wrong but i don't know where the aggressiveness came from. I'm on your side, and i agree that would be a violation of someone's religious liberty. But from what I've seen so far, the Satanic Temple has not been successful in court helping it's followers gain abortions. If you can prove me wrong, I would be glad to listen to you, but you havent yet told me anything i don't know.  I would not be surprised if they have won a case, i am okay with being proven wrong as this is not a topic that concerns me entirely."
20,Glad i got my point across!
