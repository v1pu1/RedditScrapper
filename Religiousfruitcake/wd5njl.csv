1,"That's not a Legacy, that's a Dodge."
2,Christianity=30 year old Dodge camper van!
3,"There were shrooms back in 91 too so....possible!

Edit...that's no legacy either.  That's the type of vehicle the bad guy drives in all those procedural crime dramas about sexual predators"
4,"Seriously depressing image. Jesus, that's the best you could do?"
5,"1991, huh? That could have been T1000 from the future."
6,His legacy is a sketchy rape van?
7,Sounds like another psychotic episode.
8,"Vandude: “Yo mane, lowkey i don’t wanna scare you but Jesus was an alien. Also I’m an alien 😐”

You (royal):🤯🤯🤯😳 bc Vandude could be legit.."
9,Must have been a reboot.
10,"""Hi I'm Jesus.  I've got this van I'm not using, you look like you could use some wheels.""

""Praise The Lord!""

""You've been a good Christian, so I'm going to give you a solid discount.  I'd never sell it to an atheist this cheap.""

""Thanks Mr. Christ.  I'll never forget this.""

""Tell your Christian friends, I've got some other cars for sale too.  I'm trying to raise money for the poor."""
11,Jesus was on a budget it seems
12,"No that's when the van driver did DMT and ayahuasca and 'met' Jesus.      

Thankyou for my slice of fruitcake."
13,Seems like a shitty legacy for a demigod.
14,Quite a big leap for a carpenter designing a car.
15,"bro Jesus must be really old, he’s gotta be at least in his 2000s"
16,It is quite Dodgy
17,Time for a replacement.
18,"> sexual predators

Wait, is *that* His legacy? Between the Catholic church and Southern Baptist pastors...."
19,"8 year olds, Dude."
