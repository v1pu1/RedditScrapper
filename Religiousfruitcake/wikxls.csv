1,"My independent woman used her independent brain to get her mother out of Lebanon and support her in the US, so I guess the devil is a 75+ year-old woman who was sold into marriage at age 12. Surely giving an old woman a few years of happiness is the devil's work! 

Those Christ-cultists worship their own stupidity."
2,"Couldn‚Äôt possibly be that some of those guys are assholes and that‚Äôs why they were divorced. No, it‚Äôs education is BAD"

11,‚ÄúI can‚Äôt financially coerce women into staying with me anymore.‚Äù
12,Stupid bimbo doesn‚Äôt even accept comments. Guess she‚Äôs afraid someone may actually make sense and shatter her worldview.
13,This 180 half way through felt like several punches to the gut
14,"I mean, she has a college degree in education so ‚Ä¶üßêüßêüßê"
15,"Sorry, but the red scribbles don't hide anything. I know exactly who posted this. She tweets 4 and 5 times a day about how women need to be silent and stay home. I say hail Satan."
16,"So god doesn‚Äôt want them to be independent?

Its ways of the devil?

Religion is god awful"
17,I literally got a migrain reading that. Wtf.
18,"I wonder which US State will adopt Gilead laws. If I had to bet on it I‚Äôd say the shit hole state of Texas within tht next 20 years. With Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and a Florida not too far behind."
19,I worked full time outside the home while my husband was a stay at home dad who also took care of his mother. This was our choice. I think that would make her tiny brain explode.
20,The day this broad kicks the bucket will be a FABULOUS day for all women!!
21,It's actually a woman
