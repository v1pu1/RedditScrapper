1,Where are these anti-christian schools? I would send my kids to one if I could.
2,"Wtf is a ‚Äòdevout‚Äô atheist? 

Regardless, plenty of atheists send their kids to private schools associated with a religion, even through university level. As if every student at Georgetown, for instance, is Catholic‚Ä¶"
3,Anyone with this conspiratorial worldview is going to be the absolute worst member of any school.
4,I feel bad if they have children.
5,"These weirdo religious people giving their kids their ""education"" at home or part of churches are going to be big mad when they can't use those scores in the workplace. You can't do many jobs without real education."
6,I know an atheist who went to a Catholic school
7,I'm an atheist and both my kids went to a christian school. Both are atheists as are the majority of their friends they went to school with.
8,"""devout"" athiest??? Hahaha"
9,Knowledge is.
10,Education should not be neutral between reality and fictional bullshit
11,"I was my whole school life  in catholic schools and I knew probably 4 people being ""real"" christians. Everyone else didn't gave a fuck and skipped church everytime as well as most parts of the religious side of the curriculum."
12,"My father went to a christian school. Still atheist.

I went to a christian school. Still atheist.

My kids went to a christian school. Still atheist for now.

The won't be hurt by one prayer a day where they can chose to not pray."
13,"They do have a point.

I say:

‚ÄúKeep your brats at home and let the smart kids learn a few things without your mindless interference.‚Äù"
14,Public education is as neutral as fallible humans can make it. The fundies are just mad because their religious beliefs are not being forced on people who aren't part of their religion.
15,"If reality is anti-Christian, it's not the education system's problem."
16,"""Devout atheist.""

Tell me you're a fucking dunce who doesn't know what the term atheist means without just saying you're a fucking dunce who doesn't know what that term means."
17,"""Would atheists send their kids to a Christian school?""

No, but only because they'd probably be expelled on the first day for asking questions the teachers were unable to answer."
18,I love my children. Why would I want to ruin their future by sending them to a Christian school?
19,"Ok but also many kids who go to catholic schools come out as at least one of these:

- Atheist
- Agnostic
- a part of the LGBTQ+ community


So, I mean... Whatever."
20,"Accepting others for who they are is now ""antichristian"""
21,Education is not neutral. So true. Some educate and discipled. Others just focus on educating.
22,"My parents were atheists and I went to a school run by the church of England in the 1980s.   Wasn't that full on, about the only religious bit was a vicar came in and gave assembly once a week.  Was actually quite an interesting guy, fought in the RAF during ww2 and half his assemblies were about how the next generation need to avoid mistakes of the past and avoid war."
23,Catholic schools in Canada with more public funding than public schools: Am I a joke to you?
24,"My son went to catholic school during elementary/jr high, not for the molestation but because the schoolwork was more challenging. We looked at religion class as ‚Äúreligious history‚Äù and he‚Äôs still an atheist with some catholic friends."
25,"When I went to catholic school you have no idea how many kids were atheist or agnostic. The truth is most if the kids in private school don't care about the religious aspect, the cared about money and clothes they're rich dad's could get them."
26,Let's hope not
27,"The majority of schools in my country are Catholic, so atheists are routinely sending their kids there as there's no alternative."
28,Exactly. I went to a Christian school and it gave me the chance to question things and pushed me to atheism quicker than a secular school would've.
29,"I sure do love being a devout atheist! I go to science church every monday morning, I wear a photo of stephen hawking around my neck in a locket, and I love enjoying many atheist holidays such at sciencemas! Where we all gather 'round our 65,000,000 year old dinosaur skeleton and sing some sciencemas carols. And don't forget sciencer where we gather up the kiddies and hunt for tiny little models of the solar system!"
30,"...dangerous to superstition.

Which is good."
31,"Agreed, but I think the term ""devout vegan"" when I see one equating eating meat with having sex with animals..."
32,"This certainly wouldve been my life if I was raised by my grandparents solely (this almost happened, mom and I were very sick when I was born and my dad was freshly murdered)

I often wonder what kind of idiot i would've grown up to be under their full care.ü§î

Shit is a spooky situation to be born into."
33,Ireland?
34,"It's the same where I live, but instead of being Catholic, most of them are CofE"
35,"Ding, ding, ding!"
