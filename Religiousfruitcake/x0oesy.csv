1,Is this really the analogy they want? The dog doesn't know the fleas exist. All he knows is he's itchy. He'd be better off without them.
2,Dogs didn't make fleas. And it's entirely possible for the fleas to conduct experiments to prove the dog exists.
3,"We have surpassed the tower of babylon with satellites and still no gods.

I wonder what the fleas see when they build their rocket ships."
4,Do they believe we live on God or something?
5,"Yes, because fleas didn't exist until dogs did.

Do they really think that the dog's genes seperated and created little entities known as fleas?

They really need to read some children encyclopedias."
6,"The thing that offends me the most about this is that ""ath-flea-ist"" is a terrible pun."
7,What if cat ?
8,This is kind of a whimsical pun imo. If I didn't know it was made by religious people I'd might think of it as chuckleworthy.
9,I thought this was an analogy for flat earthers at first.. which kinda fits!
10,doesn't this imply that the earth is a living organism. this sounds way more pagan than islamic. so Gaia is what I take away from this pic lol
11,And what is DOG spelled reverse?!?! (Big brain) time
12,"So, if I‚Äôm reading this correctly, they want us to worship Gaia?"
13,"There is a south park episode that does this same thing with lice and humans. Except that representation actually put some thought into it. Because in terms of ""God"" the fleas were not put there by the dog and the dog actively despises the fleas. I want to see the flipped version of this where the fleas pray to their uncaring God because the straw man must be completed in its entirety."
14,"Wouldn't an ""ath-flea-ist"" doubt the existence of fleas?"
15,"Alternatively, ‚ÄúMy Dog God is the only True God‚Äù says the Fleaist living on a donkey‚Äôs ass."
16,"Love this argument cause nobody (and I mean literally nobody) knows if they are currently on a dog, or on a cat, or on a bear, or any of the hairy mammals that exist. Likewise how do the religious people know that their god is the correct one. There could be multitudes of gods and each one has tricked them into believing that the other ones don't exist.

Also, can't believe they are also suggesting that the religious people (who are not pictured here) are probably busy sucking."
17,"Woah! Thats a nice arguement 
I am gonna believe in god from now on ü§ì"
18,Do we live on God? Is it like a Norse mythology type deal?
19,TIL we live on God's mortal vessel lmao
20,The worst part is how much they botched that grammar.
21,This looks more suitable as a comparison to flat earthers
22,Plot twist: They're on a cat.
23,"Their analogy is wrong. It would more comparable to atheists saying ‚Äúwhat proof do we have there is an earth?‚Äù The dog didn‚Äôt create them, the live on it."
24,This is more of a flat earth criticism than anything remotely related to religion.
25,"I mean, they can just leave the fur and see the dog. Humans on the other hand left earth and went to space but it's not like god was there either."
26,The dog is visible. God isn‚Äôt and we have no logical evidence of him.
27,Are we sure this is actually a dog and not someone's beard? Maybe the fleas don't know the difference.
28,Nah that's flat earthers
29,"This proves that, the artist has zero knowledge on how fleas attack dogs, how they spread, and their life cycle."
30,This is just an old panfleaist argument.
31,"As an athiest, I can confirm that we all go to the Church of Science every week to sit around and listen to preachings of how there is no god. /s"
32,"The dog literally exists and can be investigated by flea-scientists whereas god, by the Theist's definition, exists outside of time and space where he quite conveniently can't be detected by scientific means.   
The ""proof"" of the dog is not cryptic prophecies and dream-messages delivered to select few, particularly bigoted and paranoid fleas; said messages invariably revolving around said little assholes getting to tell all the other fleas how to live their lives and pick on the ones they don't like."
33,"Anthropic Atheists vs. Psyllic Acynists.

Edit: Aectotheodytists vs Aectocynodytists (Without-External God/Dog-Dweller Creeders)"
34,This is closer to flat earthers than atheist.
35,"See, this is actually more like people who deny the existence of the Earth. The Dog isn't sapient, it didn't create the fleas."
36,Looks like I can just assert that the universe was created by leprechauns and that proves the existence of leprechauns.
37,That's kinda funny actually
38,Are we living on gods scalp?
39,"Interesting, because in this example the dog is their adversary wanting to kill them."
40,"Do they...do they think we don't believe we live on a planet?

Because otherwise it kinda seems like in this analogy, the ""theistic"" fleas would be claiming the dog was made specially for them by an all-powerful and loving deity. Maybe not the comparison a theist should make..."
41,"More like ""flea-t earth convention"". They could easily test the existence of dog, in fact many of them did, including leaving the dog and taking pictures, as well as taking cat samples."
42,"This analogy only works if you see the Earth itself as god, because the fleas are living on the dog in this picture. So this is an endorsement of Gaia. Unexpected, but I accept this validation of paganism"
43,So we are surviving by sucking God's blood? That's wild.
44,"So we‚Äôre living on the skin of God? 

That‚Äôs a new one 

Well God spelled backwards is Dog after all"
45,"""I'm sorry, you have us confused with Qanon...."""
46,"Terrible analogy for so many reasons. We all know the earth exists, which is the equivalent to the dog here. The dog fucking hates fleas though so if they are comparing it to god, does that mean god wants us all wiped out with a special shampoo used for 2 weeks that smells like shit?"
47,"Unless this meme is made by a pantheist, it doesn't even make any sense. No atheist denies that the earth exist."
48,More like a flat earth convention
49,"So if the theist position was "" 'god' is what we stand on"", i'm pretty sure none of us would be atheists.

How is your literal environment, which is empirically observable, a good an analogy for god, which is not?"
50,So the earth is god. Got it.
51,"this is a better analogy for flat earthers, which the majority of are conservative christians"
52,At least they admit they consider themselves parasites
53,"Side note, I love the word athfleaist."
54,"Bitch, that arthropoda clad is older than our species, never mind canines"
55,Cuz it could be pomos beard.
56,"I'm not sure this was  made by a person with a religious agenda, just a cute joke. Op I think is illustrating loosely how theists see atheists (denying the obvious 'evidence' of god)."
57,"lots, actually. Definitely more proof than theists have of god (that being none)"
58,"This is so stupid, but still gotta say the skit is pretty funny"
59,"This is especially stupid. whether or not fleas have the capacity to detect it, all of the evidence for living on a dog is all around them. 

Meanwhile we can peer into the very origins of our universe, and detect almost unimaginably small particles, but we haven‚Äôt ever had one objectively verifiable or measurable glimpse of God. Which is a little surprising considering 2000 years ago he was apparently showing himself all over the place."
60,"This has ***serious*** ""**Far Side**"" vibes; *please please please please* do more......."
61,"Wordplay made me chortle with the ath-flea-ist convent, but that‚Äôs the only value this comic has"
62,"When i saw this meme, i read the Flea-ist as Fascist and the rest of the meme becomes based as if you ignore the Ath, the meme becomes a left wing meme making fun of right wingers‚Ä¶

But unfortunately this is a right wing meme"
63,"This is actually a better metaphor for flat-earthers, which a lot of really religious people are.

""How do we know there's a dog??""

""Well we get our food from biting beneath our feet to draw blood. If what's beneath our feet wasn't a living organism there'd be no blood, so we tested it and found out it's a dog""

""Nah god said four corners of the earth earth is flat"""
64,"Or maybe it's just a silly cartoon? I'm an atheist and I could see myself making this joke.  I mean, there are plenty of ridiculous examples of religious fruitcakes on this sub. I don't count this. It's just a cute cartoon. Reading these comments where people are saying things like ""Do they really believe we live ON god?""  That doesn't instill confidence in the intelligence of this community either."
65,"BY this logic, there are countless gods upon which we feed.  We can jump between gods when they are in proximity to each other."
66,"I mean, I'm down to start doing some druid shit.  At least I can touch the earth and feel the wind.  That's more than I ever got from any god."
67,that‚Äôs literally saying ‚Äúhow do we KNOW we are on earth??‚Äù as if atheists deny earth is our planet lol
68,Maybe they are on some different animal?
69,"The same person who drew that would fall convulsing to the ground if they met someone who claimed that the planet is a god, even though that's the direct analogy we can draw from their cartoon."
70,"I don‚Äôt see any evidence in this analogy that there IS a dog. It‚Äôs implied by the author, but that could be any animal. They could be on a cat, a rat, or any number of other animals. Considering the amount of animals a flea will eat from, it‚Äôs actually unlikely that this specific one is a dog. 


These fleas are in the right to question, and without knowing more about their weird little universe, they may be fully right about the absence of dog."
71,I interpret the meme as the dog is all around the fleas but still they fail to see it which is pretty stupid as the fleas can at least feed from the dog and jump from dog to dog which automatically proves the existence of dogs I mean who sits there thinking hmm this is a good example to use against atheists.
72,Wait... Is earth just... God's hairy butt?
73,"There is no proof, could be a cat too. Or a carpet."
74,"It's all about the definition of ""Dog"""
75,Checkmate! Help me Jesus‚Ä¶err Allah‚Ä¶Budha? Which one is right again?
76,So God is just the Earth. Guess I‚Äôm no longer an atheist then.
77,"If they had the scientific instruments, they could observe, measure and test the dog. The tests could be re-created and tested by others to validate the results.
Can people do that with ANY religion or ANY of the thousands of God's??"
78,"This has to be atheist satire, or do Christians really view themselves as a flea is significant to a dog? Also, dog created fleas? These people are too dumb to be making analogies when they can't even describe reality."
79,I appreciate the puns even though it sucks
80,"Ironically this is pretty funny. 
It's funnier still, when they're implying they believe in Gaea from the analogoy if the dog being the earth."
81,So being an atheist means I‚Äôm unaware I‚Äôm living on Earth? Weak analogy is weak.
82,"Well in that analogy, I don't believe earth exists. But I do. I don't believe God created the earth, because I don't have evidence. I have evidence of earth."
83,This analogy would mean that they think atheists don't believe in the Earth üò≠
84,This applies best to flat earthers
85,Troll 2 vibes with dog being God spelled backwards
86,This would be clever if there were actually a god
87,if fleas could talk and have a podium they could jump off the dog and fucking look at the beast. good lard
88,It's a bad argument but at least it's a clear one which is more than we can normally say
89,"They may not know the concept of a ""dog"", but they know what is a live being, there is a reason they suck from an animal and not the floor."
90,What
91,"Funny thing with the analogy of God = dog.

The fleas are parasites to the dog.

The dog is actively trying to get those things off it

Explains the God genocides!"
92,this would work as a flat earth comic as well
93,"But even if there really is a dog, if there isn't enough evidence to believe there is a dog, they shouldn't believe it."
94,"Not even theistic, but this is funny as hell to me"
95,Yeah sure it‚Äôs funny and all but I think time would be better spent if they were arguing whether or not the dog is flat
96,The drawing is actually hilarious imo but these theists are stupid if they really think this is a 1:1 comparison to atheists and religions.
97,This is more how i view flat earthers
98,Fleas aren't created by dogs. Sooo already a pretty bad analogy
99,This is actually a good argument for pantheism.
100,"I would guess a flee living on a dog will feel himself being shaken around when a dog has zoomies.

But did someone ever truly and irrecovically felt the presence of god? Like with all the tech we have we should be able to point at something and say, yep, thats god"
