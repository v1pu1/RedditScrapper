1,"What?

Atheists read the Bible way more then theists. It’s a running joke at this point"
2,"Actually, data shows that nonbelievers know more about what is truly in the Bible.than believers do. Believers get told what they believe with the cherry picked verses. Athiest read the bible.for exactly what it says. Which is how athiestd know Christians are hypocritical non believers in their own text."
3,It's true. We just like to poke fun at the Idiocracy of the religious
4,r/selfawarewolves ?
5,"Yes. A big part of why I'm not a Christian is because I grew up to realize what a complete piece of shit every Christian I know is. Seriously, I live in a very progressive state, and the only overt racists I know are Christians"
6,I love reading the Bible. By itself its an artifact from ancient history. Some great stories in there. But believing in it? Miss me with that.
7,We read the Bible. That’s why we’re unbelievers.
8,"""unbelievers"""
9,"Oh, but we do, and yes, we do.

Part of the reason I left Christianity was the absolute madness I found when I tried to do a full read-through to 'save my faith'.

As for reading 'the flock', I mean, kind of.  There is an atheist-friendly UU congregation near me that I am seriously considering going to some Sundays after I get boosted again because I know some of them and they're cool as ~~hell~~ _~~heaven~~_ Valhalla."
10,"I've read, studied, and memorized more of the Bible in my lifetime than any christian I know."
11,"‘I learn from the mistakes of people who take my advice.’

‘I learn from the mistakes of people who take the hokey bible’s advice by proxy.’"
12,More like they’ve read both.
13,"O god so much hypocrisy, may face is melting off from reading all the hypocrisy of the christians!!!!!"
14,I mean if they use the bible to attack abortion and trans people they definitely haven’t read it
15,"Maybe it's supposed to be self-critique concerning christian hypocrisy. 

Here's my progression up till now:

Stage 1: Think the Bible is dumb based on superficial Sunday-School education

Stage 2: Think the Bible is digusting and barbaric based on actually reading it.

Stage 3: Think the Bible might actually be smart after reading a bunch of apologetics who point out things I had not noticed and answering some of my burning questions

Stage 4: Return to thinking the Bible is dumb after starting to read it again, noticing more nonsense than I did the first time round or had simply forgotten about"
16,Reading the Bible helps to understand references in classical literature. It’s great for a reference book.
17,It has to be treated more like grimm’s fairytales than a textbook
18,"Shouldn't be treated as a textbook, but it is much more than a selection of fairytales. I think you know that too."
