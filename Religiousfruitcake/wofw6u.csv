1,There is no such thing as “forced sex”. That’s called rape.
2,"It’s so annoying when Christians cherry pick verses

I went to read

Revelation 3:19 - 20
New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition

19 I reprove and discipline those whom I love. Be earnest, therefore, and repent.(A)  

20 Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and eat with you, and you with me.

It has nothing to do with what he’s saying. How dare that dude pervert scripture"
3,"He doesn't condone sexual assault, he demands it."
4,"Jesus: Love all, don't use violence, forgive, be good to each other

6,Christians. Making their religion look horrible once more.
7,"You get to show dominance and get your rocks off at that same time.  Win win.  Just like a pedophile.

8,"“As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.” (Revelation of John 3:19, KJV)

I don't see anything here that specifically talks about disciplining your wives, jeez, these fools don't even read the book, but sure love to quote it."
9,"I'm sure a lot of these ""deeply religious"" men would be much happier if they left the local church and joined the local kinky scene instead. Find a partner that concent to, and enjoy, a little domestic discipline every now and then. All the action but no one gets hurt."
10,"Fuck this guy.

Hes also explicitly pro-grooming. He thinks girls should be married off as soon as they menstruate. And he says this is because they're ""easier to mold"", which is literally grooming."
