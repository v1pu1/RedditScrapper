1,No one fucking understands what THE SATANIC TEMPLE actually is and its purpose.
2,"> Since when can a taxpayer funded school RENT a gym to a Satanist ?

Well, as a matter of fact, the Satanist Temple DOES pay their taxes. All the more reason they should be allowed to rent.

As someone commented, this is all why the Satanist Temple exist : to raise awareness about what a scam some parts of religions are.
And to annoy pearl-clutching fruitcakes"
3,"Has anyone figured out who ""they"" are yet?"
4,"If they have a Christian after school club, than it is required by law to allow similar clubs for other religions"
5,How dare they attempt to brainwash kids S/
6,The satanic temple will always be a hero in my eyes. Honestly they're some of the nicest people I've ever met.
7,"One thing I never understood about people saying “they’re exposing themselves” (about anything really).

Let’s say the satanists are running everything behind a curtain, and one day the veil is lifted and it turns out to be true. If they were already running things before, they’re already in power, what are you gonna do about it? 

“**gasp, they’ve exposed themselves**”

Ok, now what? What will you do? They were already fully in control, what do you think is gonna change?

Swap satanists with literally anything else, and you’ve got the same situation."
8,Be careful make sure you follow the fairy tale everyone else follows
9,Man if only the world was rid of religiousretardos
10,"If I understand it correctly, this is its purpose."
11,"The secret rulers of the world, who are actually Freemason Jewish lizards, of course. /s"
12,It's always the Jews. We're dealing with leftover Nazism someone popped in the microwave here so what do you expect?
13,Please elaborate. What exactly?
14,"Yeah basically. It either forces them to accommodate the Satanic Temple or admit that they're not supporting ""religious liberty"" but state-sanctioned Christianity."
15,Basically to rile up the religious fruitcakes by using the word Satan and demanding equal treatment in the public sphere to Christianity.
16,"The Satanic Temple is a secular humanist organization/religion that advocates for 1st amendment issues and helps point out hypocrisy. Being a religion they should have the same religious rights as other churches, if a government allows a biblical statue to be placed on government land TST will fight to have a satanic statue placed as well since its unfair if only one religion gets government allowance. 

In this case they have made an after school program because the school has allowed christian after school programs. The ""shocking"" name of the religion helps show how wild government endorsement of religion can be when they ask for the same treatment as christians regularly get.

17,This guy gets it
18,YES. Love the Temple and their mission.
19,Because religious freedoms needs to be proper freedom and not the warped hypocrisy of the church.
20,Which is one form of 'Satanism'. I think the other main one is the Church of Satan?? as a giver of knowledge and a symbol of equality and scientific inquiry.
