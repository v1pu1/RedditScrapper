9,Invisible man in the sky…. Which one do you think that falls under?
10,That HAS to be a troll page
11,It's always projection with these people.

14,"""jordan peterson biblical studies"" i give up on humanity. this was the last fucking straw"
15,Ignorance and arrogance are a hell of a combo
16,"Comforting lies, such as, there is an after life where you will see your dead loved ones again and live happily ever after?

Like that?"
17,"Isn’t heaven and therefore the afterlife, by design a comforting lie?"
18,"This is basically Nietzsche’s view on intellectual strength. 

""The strength of a person's spirit would then be measured by how much 'truth' he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified.”

But also another famous quote by Nietzsche, “Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.” 

He would view these Christians using his own quotes to justify Christianity, while he was a devout atheist, to be just as a person who fights with these comforting lies, yet is comforted by their own.

Jordan Peterson was inspired by Nietzsche, but has misused his arguments."
19,Did they make them take off their red hats upon entry?
20,r/selfawarewolves
21,"boo, I liked some of what he said sometimes, like a lot. is it okay to still agree with some and not all of his thinking?"

32,No fking way a religious group posted this. No way 😂😂💀
33,"It is palpable, you can palp it."
34,His Bible studies are based on secularity though.
35,"“Blessed be those that clean their room, for they shall inherit the house.”"
36,You are not very familiar with peterson are  you?
37,That is a *long* con then.
38,"Nah, if anything, Peterson is waiting in line."
39,It’s very real.
40,Because Peterson is full of crap.
41,"Idk man it seems to me like he kinda slowly over the years bought into the shit he was bordering on but wasn't completely part of yet. 

also something happened to his wife I think and that fucked him up mentally (even though I didn't really like him before that either)"
42,A Christian friend of mine sent me a Jordan Peterson video and then had the audacity to tell me that Dawkins is an idiot. 🤯
43,I need that on a bumper sticker
44,"""The bibble is true because the bibble says its true"" -Bordan Beterson"
45,I dropped the ball not posting it there.
46,"It’s absolutely not, I have an alternate social media account to view these pages & it’s absolutely very real."
47,My Christian coworker has mentioned Jordan Peterson has brought up biblical topics in his podcast before. I think there is a chance this page is real.
48,"Peterson is always pushing religion, specifically christianity. This is not really any weirder than taking Jordo seriously."
49,"I mean Peterson is very good at explaining psychology as seen through the Jungian lens and if some individuals have become more effective by listening to his psychological work, more power to them.

But he needs to stay the fuck in his lane, because these days he's meddling in politics (claiming everyone needs perfect lives before they protest, which is odd given he's willing to preach all kinds of bullshit while struggling with benzo addiction),  implying we need some form of 'enforced monogamy' to help all the incels combat that eeeevil 'female hypergamy' (yes, he basically just invented academic-sounding jargon for 'those Stacies only want Chad and Tyrone cock'), and of course, his fucking ridiculous tweet where he vagueposts, on pride month, 'remember when pride was a sin?', an obvious homophobic dog whistle, before moving on to imply surgeons that perform sex transition surgery are criminals.

Oh, and then, when told that his homophobic/transphobic dog whistle tweet is exactly that, he plays the cowardly 'what have I said that was bigoted?' card, ending his screed with the muppet-like 'UP YOURS, WOKE MORALISTS, WE'LL SEE WHO CANCELS WHO'.

Ever since stepping out of his lane, Jordan Peterson has revealed himself to be little more than an adequate psychology professor with delusions of being a philosophical renaissance man out to bring the western world 'back to its Judeo Christian roots'."
50,"I enjoyed watching [Some More News - A Brief Look at Jordan Peterson](https://youtu.be/hSNWkRw53Jo). I am close with a JP enthusiast (although they've become less talkative about him these days) so I've heard many defenses of him. Some More News does a good job of looking at JP involving himself in many different subjects such as the climate crisis when maybe he should just stfu. 


IMO his bullying attacks on Yumi Nu and Elliot Page have been recent examples of him trying to lash out to stay relevant in the whole ""anti-woke"" discussion. For someone who puts such emphasis on being precise with words, he sure does come off like a bull in a china shop with his. Now apparently he's working with Bench Appearo...if that doesn't scream right wing grifter I don't know what does."
51,"I used to like him back in 2017 all the way back to the start of his career. He honestly had some decent points and I'll stand by that. But my God, after his benzo addiction he fell off the deep end and turned into the biggest grifter imaginable."
52,"Same, a lot of what he says makes sense and seems to be valuable. He just loses me every time as soon as he goes into the religion/mysticism stuff, I don't get it and I don't need that as a foundation for the rest of it."
53,Not in the reddit hivemind
54,"Of course that's okay, surely you don't think you have to agree with every single thing someone believes in order to agree with them on one thing?

Also this is from some Facebook group, not JP himself. But he is religious"
55,It is so easily palped.
56,Yeah but Peterson didn't post this. A kid names Katlo Kind did and I also think he's trolling.
57,You dare question the word of the mighty Jimmy? !
58,"Looking at their stuff, I would say it wouldn't fit likely, they are more likely (what they consider) a grifter than what they consider a wolf, a wolf being genuinely convinced in what they say."
59,Facebook needs to be shut down
60,"Basically, Peterson is both extremely vague about whether he believes in God, what his version of God is, heck, he tends to default to a nonexistent 'Judeo-Christian Tradition', whatever the fuck that means (last I checked, Judaism is Judaism in part because it explicitly *rejects* Christianity), but he also specifically claims that regardless of whatever objective truth is there, the Bible contains some form of 'meta truth', something higher on the 'truthiness' scale than actual truth."
61,"Excellent summary. It's not like everything he's ever said is bonkers or wrong, but he has a bad tendency to draw faulty conclusions and advocate for nonsense."
62,"Just another opportunist grifting the angry Right.

Fuck him, he's a cock-juggling thundercunt."
63,"He always was a right wing, religious grifter. It's important to recognise that, so the next one won't appear to 'have some decent points'."

66,Absolute cancer on society. But shutting it down will only spawn something else. These social media sites need to be held more responsible for creating these echo chambers preying on vulnerable individuals with tailored laws.
67,"Telegram is even worse.

It's where all the conspiracy idiots and the fascists/nazis and the anti vaxxers and flat earthers and the religious fundamentalists and Putin fans and all that scum hang out"
68,">tends to default to a nonexistent 'Judeo-Christian Tradition', whatever the fuck that means (last I checked, Judaism is Judaism in part because it explicitly rejects Christianity)

Both Judaism and Christianity come from the same roots (as does Islam) - Judaism and Christianity specifically both hold the Old Testament of the Bible to be the word of God. Explicitly, all three of those religions believe in the same God.

So, that's what that means. This is like world religion 101 stuff, so I'd ease up on talking like it makes no sense. The Judeo-Christian tradition is very much a thing that exists.

Just because you don't know anything about it (reasonably, given if you've never felt the need to learn about it and have never been part of that world), just because Peterson spouts a ton of nonsense doesn't mean that particular phrase is nonsense or has no meaning in the world of religion."
69,He's kind of like the token public intellectual right wingers can point to when they realise Ben Shapiro is dumb enough to suggest selling sunken coastal houses to Aquaman.
70,"He wasn't nearly as bad or vitriolic as he was in 2017. Then he realised he could make bank, gorlt qddicted to prescription drugs and now we're here."
71,"Nah. I mean, he might have wanted to be, but to all appearances, he clued into the fact that he got a lot more traction from the right wing nut jobs when he vaguely approached points that validated their worldview, and went hard that direction and away from his more reasonable stuff because their response gratified him more than the rather sedate acceptance to his more reasonable positions.

He's always had some problematic ideas, which is why it was an easy shift. But he didn't seem to start there, all in on that stuff."
72,"Sure, a lot of religious people use the term because of the shared origin, but anything shared by Judaism and Christianity is also shared by Islam, and this group of three can be much more conveniently labelled 'Abrahamic'.

What exactly does Judaism have specifically in common with Christianity and nothing else? Belief in Messianic prophecy to some degree? The ten commandments (which, interestingly, nobody seems to care about outside of the Orthodox Jewish community seeing as everybody else seems to work on the Sabbath)?

In terms of pure semitic mythology shared by both Judaism and Christianity, as I said, that shit can be covered by 'Abrahamic tradition', but there's a reason Peterson doesn't phrase it like that. Something to do with how brown the skin of the practitioners of one certain Abrahamic religion are.

(just preemptively, not trying to act as an Islam apologist, Islam is just as incoherent as Judaism and Christianity, but I do find it telling that Peterson uses a less wieldy label just to exclude it from the beliefs he claims to attach himself to)"
73,"Not as mask off, for sure."
74,"Islam has in many ways separated itself from the other Abrahamic religions. In specific, they treat the old testament of the Bible differently than either Christianity or Judaism. The Quran has supplanted it entirely.

Judaism and Christianity share a *much* closer relationship, globally, than do either with Islam. *Especially* from the perspective of Christianity, who still consider ethnic Jews to be God's children, and acknowledge that Jesus was Jewish. Judaism is therefore very important to Christians. Much more so than Christianity is important to practicing Jews, or either religion is important to Islam or either considers Islam important. In fact, while I can't claim to be an expert, I'm not familiar with any other major religion that considers the people of another religion to be so important or influential in their beliefs.

Hence, Judeo-Christian tradition. You might say, from what I've said, well, that's just Christianity. Which I suppose is fair, but what you lose with that is the big reason why Christians are such big supporters of Israel - they still believe the Jews, and Jerusalem, figure in prophecies that still need to be fulfilled. They believe no such thing about Muslims, other than that they are in the way."
75,"Eh, fair, there is a fair amount of cultural entanglement (mainly Christians towards Jewish culture rather than vice versa due to the obvious; Christianity sprouted out of Judaism and not the other way around), but I would argue the 'Judeo Christian Tradition' most people (including JP) argue for is just American-styled Israel-supporting Christianity for the most part."
76,">Especially from the perspective of Christianity, who still consider ethnic Jews to be God's children, and acknowledge that Jesus was Jewish.

That's an extremely small subset of Christians. I haven't heard a Christian in 30 years admit that the Jews are ""God's children"", nor that Jesus was Jewish. I was taught that when I was young, but even my younger siblings-- who've been sucked into the evangelical cult-- think that Jesus was a Christian and Christians are ""God's chosen people""."
77,I can't disagree with that conclusion.
78,"It's the most influential group of Christians. I don't know where you live, where I am in the Bible belt, it's absolutely acknowledged - and the support for Israel is predicated on the idea that supporting Jewish ascendancy in the region is necessary to fulfill the prophecies of the end times - that the apocalypse, the end of the world, is their goal, and they are helping it along by supporting Israel.

That part is talked about less, but either way, it's a big thing to take church groups on pilgrimages to Israel."
79,"I'm in the DFW area, was born and raised in the Texas panhandle, and was in Austin for 8.5 years. One brother is in the Houston area. Support for Israel is absolute in Christianity. As you said, it's all about fulfilling ""end times prophesy""... *as they interpret it*. But I've been pointing out to those yahoos for *decades* that Jesus [were he a real person] was Jewish, and they've steadfastly claimed he was Christian. Seriously!!

I'm appalled at the western Christians who go to Jerusalem, especially for Easter, and treat the Arab Christians like scum. If Jesus returned today as he (would have) appeared 2000 years ago, American Christians would crucify him again without even thinking about it."
80,Can't disagree with you there.
