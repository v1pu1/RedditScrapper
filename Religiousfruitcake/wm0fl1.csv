1,"Can I be the first sinner to say, a world where all the religious kooks get whisked away forever and there will be no one left here but us sinners, sounds fucking excellent.

Where do I sign up?"
2,"Nice, thanks for the heads up."
3,that is a disgrace to the early model Subaru outback
4,The rapture is when all the evangelicals disappear and they act like we're supposed to fear that day.
5,Looks like SOMEONE just helped pick my kiddo's birthday party theme. Apocalyptic party it is!
6,I've survived so many raptures I've lost count.
7,Thanks for the heads up. I have a lot of sinning to do before then. I hope I can get it all accomplished.
8,It's not like any previous predictions failed! / s
9,I'm ready for the rupture!
10,Funny. I seem to have predicted against something else going on that date. Can‚Äôt exactly remember what it was at the moment. But oh well. Something else to add to the list of things to fail.
11,Cant wait to burn
12,Didn‚Äôt that already happen?   Loss track of these things
13,"At least it‚Äôs after my vacation next week, would hate to miss it because of hellfire and brimstone."
14,"And on September 26, we can all point and laugh once again."
15,"Why do these wackjobs keep trying to predict armageddon, aren't the previous failed predictions enough proof they have sawdust for brains?"
16,How many raptures am I going to have to love through? It keeps happening but all of it's annoying believers never seem to get taken.
17,Happy birthday to me i guess
18,!remindme 46 days
19,"After my wedding but before my honeymoon. Not terrible, not great."
20,"Do you think they will have a shred of self-awareness when they have to scrape this off on September 26th? Nah, me neither."
21,"I'm ready.

To move into your homes, touch all your stuff, ride your motorcycles and fight for Lucifer."
22,"It‚Äôs just the luck of Mets fans that the ONE YEAR we have a team that could win the World Series, there would be a freaking APOCALYPSE before the postseason."
23,At least I won‚Äôt have to deal with another full year of school
24,Don‚Äôt forget to bring a towel.
25,Dibs on their stuff
26,I‚Äôm gonna buy a full calendar year of these and just change it for whatever the next day is every morning.
27,Most Christian post I have seen here.
28,Are they gonna stream the soldier boy version of this song on big speakers on this date?
29,Shit.  I need to shop.
30,Again? Thanks for the heads up. This gives my enough time to advertise my Extended Pet Care Rapture Insurance service. A friendly dog loving atheist will care for your furry family members in the event of a rapture. For a non-refundable fee of course.
31,Thats before bigger navi and 40 series! Can they delay it i want to game at 144fps
32,"Well, in that case, I won‚Äôt bother buying a birthday present for my wife."

34,"Damn, I was hoping it was an ad for a new Bioshock game..."

39,"Damnit Jesus not my birthday, hold out one more day"
40,The Blondie Song?
41,"Ho no, just before my birthday üòü"
42,"It always seems to be the fundamentalists, evangelicals, and conservatives who keep predicting when the Rapture of Jesus returning will occur.  Over the past 2000 years the date has been predicted hundreds of times, yet He has not returned.  Obviously, for claiming to be Christian, they must not know Scripture, as Jesus Himself said that none shall know when the Son of Man will return except for the Father.  Yet they keep predicting it."
43,"Sorry, but Starfield comes out next year so I'll skip the rapture"
44,**Ah fuck here we go again**
45,Dimwit could have made it November 2022 for when his license plate expires.
46,why does the rapture have to happen on my birthday? can‚Äôt they reschedule it for November?
47,I wonder how often they've scraped that off and slapped on a new date. The disappointment must be deep.
48,What time? Don't wanna miss that.

Can we reschedule?"
50,"If I truly believed I‚Äôd be gone in a few weeks, I‚Äôd at least go get a nice, new vehicle to cruise in."
51,"Wait that's the day Italy will vote for the parliament, this will greatly influence both the participation and the results"
52,*but the Bible says that no man can know the day or the hour of the rapture roflmao*
53,"Never stuck decals/stickers on my car, how hard are they to remove?

Asking for whoever owns this car, since they're going to need to scrape this off on September 26."
54,Again?
55,Sweet XT. I hope they‚Äôre not driving when they get raptured so I can go claim their car.
56,Oh no! That's when my Disneyland trip is!
57,"what‚Äòre they gonna say when it doesn‚Äôt happen?   
besides, people have been saying that‚Äòs gonna happen for the past thousand years or so."
58,Hey I've seen this somewhere before...
59,"ü§îüí≠ but without the constant threat üî´ of burning üî• alive üî• eternally üî•üî• how can atheists üö´‚úùÔ∏èüö´ have morals üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüôèüòáüéÑüòé‚ùì‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ùî‚ùì.

60,"Fortunately, you cannot be the first sinner to say that."
61,And it'll be cooler than that because there'll be fire and war and stuff everywhere. It'll be metal as fuck. I for one can't wait to go to war against... wait are we fighting the anti-Christ or are we fighting Christ. I'd assume it'd be the anti-Christ but idk. Either way it's fine with me.
62,what if I tie my family to the ground? Can I keep them then?
63,"If you like it, just offer to pick up the keys on the night before the rapture.

Not like they are going to need an Outback where they are going.

If they don't agree, then clearly a lack of faith"
64,"There's a Wikipedia page on doomsday events! If you survive 10 in a row, can you turn them in and the 11th is free? Looks like I've survived more than 40.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_dates\_predicted\_for\_apocalyptic\_events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events)"
65,"Damn dude, you must be a hella sinner."
66,"SubGenius X-Day was July 5th, so we'll have to wait til next year for The Rupture. I put my faith in ""Bob""!"
67,I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôll just change 2022 to 2023 & say it was a mistake

69,They'll just scrape the old date off and replace it with a different one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
70,"If a towel can save you from being eaten by The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Trall, then by Zarquon it can save you from mere apocalypse."
71,"the man from Mars is through with cars, now he only eats guitars"
72,"> Obviously, for claiming to be Christian, they must not know Scripture, as Jesus Himself said that none shall know when the Son of Man will return except for the Father.

Not knowing scripture is like an entry requirement for a lot or Christian movements today."
73,Modern problems require modern solutions
74,Holy crap! There are far more than I realised.
75,I did not like the part where 10% of experts from the global challenges foundation believe that the apocalypse will occur during our lifetime. That‚Äôs not a very high percentage but it‚Äôs far too high when the topic is an imminent apocalypse.
76,"48 baby!

Also, why are the only ones that make sense fucking far away in time? Geez, you'd think certain people have an interest on the world ending tomorrow or something"
77,I do my best.
78,"Praise ""Bob""!"
79,"Oops, I forgot to carry the two when I was doing the calculations. The real date will be..."
80,Sass this hoopy. Now this is a frood who knows where his towel is.
81,"üòÅ So true, and not just Christian movements.  In recent years we have seen a lot of ‚Äòscientific, sociological, and economic‚Äô movements spring up that bear no reflection of the facts of the disciplines.  I believe we are seeing the rise of a new breed of snake-oil salesmen."
82,"Yeah, and these are only the documented ones"
83,"For from his Pipe, do the clouds of 'Frop smoke chunder forth."
84,I've done my homework. üòÅ
