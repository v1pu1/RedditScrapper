1,"Hey, remember when we used to see these stories and say, ""Well, clearly that's unconstitutional and the Supreme Court will strike it down?""

I miss those days."
2,"The Satanic Temple needs to donate a Bunch of ""In God We Trust"" signs. Their logo front and center, surrounded by that slogan."
3,time for kids to start vandalizing stupid signs...
4,"Weird overly religious people: “I’m SICK of these LGBT people indoctrinating THE CHILDREN into their SINFUL LIVES they are causing ALL THESE PROBLEMS like pedophila and gun violence simply by EXISTING”

Also weird overly religious people: “okay we gotta make sure we teach our kids about God and the Bible as soon as they learn to walk that’s gonna solve all our issues”"
5,"I’m so glad we are teaching our kid about how fucked up these people are. He knows that we will back him up for any stand he makes against this bullshit. And yeah, we are in Texas."
6,How does this not violate the 1st amendment?
7,"I'm 57, but believe it or not I used to be a teenager!

I remember 'way back then' that one of the most effective ways to turn teenagers against your message was to try and shove it down their throats. I considered all the dorky school posters as idiotic and out of touch mock-worthy garbage.

I imagine that there may be teens even today that still feel the same way."
8,Time to sue Texas
9,Bet they’d lose their shit and pop a blood vessel if you put up a sign saying “In Allah we trust.”
10,"Funny it’s the motto displayed on currency, and not “god bless America” or “one nation” etc. But makes sense."
11,"Fine.

Put Morgan Freeman's face on those."
12,"OK, so put them up... behind a trash can between the boys and girls toilets. Or in a classroom dedicated to religious studies?"
13,They did this here in Alabama a few years ago in response to FUCKING SCHOOL SHOOTINGS!
14,"In Allah We Trust

Would love to see a few of these get hung up in Texas schools. Would also love to see the heads explode when they see it."
15,"Mississippi instituted this twenty years ago. I tried turning them around, but they were pretty quick to turn them back.

I'm positive the tax dollars could go toward something better. They were even uglier than this one, too."
16,"I'd get out my sharpie so quick...""no we don't"""
17,My stupid ass was wondering why there was 2 poland flags next to US flag.
18,Kentucky had the same law pass a few years ago.
19,"So, how much would it be to get a bunch of prints of this in Arabic, framed, and shipped to schools? I think the sub could make it an event"
20,"Trust is a two-way street, and it sure seems like god ain't doing jack shit to earn that trust."
21,Nope
22,I'm surprised the state flags are smaller than the US flag.
23,We need to restore the motto.
24,Already a law in Virginia (since 2002) thanks to post 9/11 hysteria.
25,"Dang, we need a new motto."
26,Why tf are there small Polish flags around the American one?
27,Setting yourself up for vandalism but okay
28,"Sadly since this is a part of the pledge they are exploiting a loophole. The God part of the pledge has been challenged by the Supreme Court before but they say well since it's not clear what God, in particular, it's not against the 1st Amendment. Really though it does specify as it is capitalized and it does kind of imply only one god and is not really inclusive to religions like Hinduism which believes in many gods and goddesses or Buddism which doesn't believe in any God."
29,"I'm an American veteran and I don't trust in God and I don't appreciate the suggestion that I do. Speak for yourself, chuds."
30,"In God we trust:

Poland, USA , Poland 

Beautiful"
31,In God We Thrust
32,"They're exploiting a loophole.

They're displaying the Official National Motto of the US established in 1956, which superceded the defacto motto *""E Pluribus Unum""*.

Essentially, it doesn't matter what the words actually say or mean, it's literally just a mandate to display the Official National Motto.

It's the national motto that needs to change, because it very clearly is in violation of the 1st Amendment.

If the official national motto were to be changed to *""Texas Sucks Ass""*, then that's what this Texas law would require be displayed in their schools. It's not requiring *""In God We Trust""* in specific to be displayed, it's requiring the Official National Motto to be displayed, hence if you want to contest it, you have to contest the Official National Motto.

It's layered like an onion to insulate themselves... an evil authoritarian theocractic onion."
33,Wasn't that long ago the ten commandments were outside the courthouse in statue form.
34,"So I was reading about this when it was first announced and apparently the Satanic Temple can't just erect or donate their own stuff either. Comment from the original thread I encountered this on:

> This is actually worse than it sounds:

> [https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00797F.pdf#navpanes=0](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00797F.pdf#navpanes=0)

> Basically the state says it can use the US motto, with a US flag, and may not depict anything else EXCEPT that.  So you can't just donate a Church of Satan thing.  Its like the law was made for this EXACT sign, and nothing more.

> While I know the current SCOTUS would side with religion, in this case they are just supporting the ""national motto"", which is ""In God We Trust"".  We need to revoke that motto to get rid of those signs.

[Source comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wqznxn/-/ikpk12y)

Note that, as a respondent pointed out, the above commenter was slightly mistaken in that the Texas state flag must also appear on the sign.

35,Should i grab the spray paint?
36,“okay we gotta make sure we teach our kids about God and the Bible as soon as they learn to walk ~~that’s gonna solve all our issues~~ or they'll never but into it”
37,It absolutely does but conservatives don’t care about the constitution unless it’s for them and nobody else
38,"I mean so does banning books, restricting teachers from discussing real history, and attempting to censor the media, but you don't see conservatives sweating it. 

I'm fairly sure they are only aware of one amendment anyway."
39,"Technically its not religious its part of the national anthem so its not

Dumb loophole"
40,One can hope.
41,Or “in Zeus we trust”
42,"Previus motto was better, e pluribus unnum"
43,"Which really needs to be taken off the money, because aside from it just being religious garbage, it gives certain rubes the false impression that America is a ""Christian nation""."
44,"نثق في الل      ""nathiq fi allah""

In God we trust, in arabic. I don't doubt they would lose their shit anyway and claim English is official language of the US - when it's not."
45,I’d recommend white-out
46,"*Why tf are there*

*Small Polish flags around the*

*American one?*

47,"That is a super shitty national motto, And it has nothing to do with America's supposed principles."
48,"Yeah, but I’m not sure about that. 

I’m not a lawyer, but I think I can see something about requiring the accepting of donations and compelling display with the number of constraints applied “only these words with only these symbols, which are mandatory”). That seems like something that could be open to challenge. 

The other thing I’d want to look into is whether I can force them to display  signs like:

>	In “god” we trust

Various iterations apply and can be displayed together as a tryptic or something. Can we force a ruling on punctuation?

iN goD We tRuSt but in a stupid font, or dripping blood

Upside down US flag to meet flag requirement but signal distress, Mexican flag as a historical Texas flag, national motto used to make a circle-slash over the flag, that kind of thing 

Stupid or obnoxious frame around poster. Maybe something with a rainbow and grown men playing leapfrog. 

I’m just spitballing here, but I’m also semi-serious and would help fund gifts like these."
49,I’d like to petition we change the national motto to Texas sucks ass
50,Sounds like they're going all in on creating a Christian theocracy.
51,So the sign shown here (with the two Texas flags) is breaking the rule?
52,"sure. but I can't help y'all, 50something is a bit old for schoolboy shenanigans lol! anything else in public, though, I'm on it :)"
53,Just wait. Religion is garbage. Internet is here now and the kids aren’t buying it
54,"Yeah, I sure do. I considered hard-right religious people to be a threat to our future when I was a kid.

I was right."
55,"In Odin, the All-Father, we trust."
56,"It was the 1950's. Cold War with the USSR, the *""Red Scare""* over Communism on the Rise, a global Nuclear Arms Race in full swing, Civil Rights Activism brewing across the nation, the Vietnam War  looming on the horizon 

It was a very turbulent time. The motto was established mostly as a propaganda move, to differentiate *""Us God fearing Americans""* from *""those Godless Commie Bastards""*. The whole thing was just part of a much larger propaganda campaign to boost recruitment and support for the impending Vietnam War, which itself was predicated upon *""Stopping the spread of Communism""*.

In short, it was bullshit, and it was designed to drum up support from religious organizations to prop up support for the war. It worked for the most part on them, but not so much for the nation at large.

The strategy was later refined in 1968 by Richard Nixon, into what would become called *""The Southern Strategy""*. It was built upon pandering to Evangelical Christians and Racists who were still sore over the passing of the Civil Rights act of 1964. That strategy has been tweaked over the decades since, but it in large part remains a cornerstone voting demographic exploited by the Republican National Convention to this very day."
57,"Sorry, that commenter was incorrect, though that is the sign that they are referring to. Section 1.004(b)(1) states that a representation of the state flag is also mandatory.

Edit:

> Sec. 1.004. DISPLAY OF NATIONAL MOTTO. (a) A public
elementary or secondary school or an institution of higher
education as defined by Section 61.003 must display in a
conspicuous place in each building of the school or institution a
durable poster or framed copy of the United States national motto,""In God We Trust,"" if the poster or framed copy meets the
requirements of Subsection (b) and is:

> (1) donated for display at the school or institution;
or

> (2) purchased from private donations and made
available to the school or institution

> (b) poster or framed copy of the national motto described
by Subsection (a):

> (1) must contain a representation of the United Statesflag centered under the national motto and a representation of the state flag; and

> (2) may not depict any words, images, or other information other than the representations listed in Subdivision(1).

> (c) public elementary or secondary school and an
institution of higher education may accept and use private
donations for the purposes of Subsection (a)."
58,The Cold War was ironically the best time for fascists in the US to sink their claws into politics for the foreseeable future.
59,‘God fearing’ doesnt sound as cool as they think it does. Sounds like a wimp
60,"Does Texas have one of those religious 'freedom' laws that the GOP seems to really like these days? If so, every religious organization NOT Christian needs to sue Texas for violating their own law."
61,"The phrase itself is (apparently) not religious in nature, though. It's the national motto, which has been [ruled constitutional](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/918/in-god-we-trust#:~:text=Its%20use%20on%20U.S.%20currency,constitutionality%20of%20the%20national%20motto.) and not in violation of the establishment clause."
62,"Actually, the national motto is E Pluribus Unum. IGWT is what the Christofascists want the motto to be.

But yeah, it was ruled to be constitutional by the same people who ruled that corporations are people"
63,"That does raise a good question: if someone gifted a Texas public school a sign with ""E Pluribus Unum"" on it, and another individual gifts them a sign with ""In God we trust"" on it, does the school have to display both signs, or only one? I assume they'd be required to display the latter, since I guess technically the motto is [not E Pluribus Unum anymore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_motto), as of 1956. A second question I'd want to know is, where do ""originalists""/conservatives fall on the change in 1956?"
