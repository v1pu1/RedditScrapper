1,For all they talk about God being almighty he sure was easy to kill.
2,"If that‚Äôs true, that the trans folk replaced god, then that‚Äôs awesome. He was a dick anyway. There was this one time where he killed everyone, even the babies. Even the puppies and kittens."
3,"How many trans people are there? If you listen to conservatives, you'd think every other person they meet is trans. 

I think I met 4, or 5 trans people my entire life. And that includes both MtF and FtM. 

Even in sports there aren't that many trans people."
4,I AM GOD LIGHTNING WILL SHOT FROM MY FINGER TIPS

10,"dude this is a really old post, and totally unrealistic, i mean, im trans, im not god, i swear, we totally didnt do this"
11,"God seems kind of pathetic really. Gays stole his rainbow, atheists killed him and now trans people replaced him. Omnipotence seems overrated."
12,"First the gays mugged God and stole the rainbow, not the trans people straight up murder God and replace him. Omnipotent beings really are helpless, aren't they?"
13,Worship me mortals lmao
14,Seems like you got yourself a pretty weak deity
15,"Full disclosure ‚Äî I've also posted this to r/antitheistcheesecake, because I am *that* confused as to what this guy‚Äôs deal is. Does he think ""God is dead"" is good or bad, and why is he blaming trans people for it? I have absolutely no clue!"
16,"""God"" would be nonbinary, no?"
17,It means he now worships trans people.
18,"so, is this like a weekend at bernies situation where trans people octodad god through his day?"
19,I trust a trans thousand times more than I trust a literal murderer
20,Nietzsche would be proud!
21,"Its official, good hustle out there team"
22,Seems like a good trade to me.
23,"Hallelujah god is dead   Hallelujah god is dead!!!  Hallelujah God is DEad!! 

I wanted to be the one who killed it. But I‚Äôm not jealous. 

Hallelujah for for the god killer!  Hallelujah for the god killer!  Hallelujah!!!

Gawd is dead.

26,"Bro, god‚Äôs been gay for a while."
27,He's signaling his intent
28,"Idiots, idiots everywhere"
29,"God only dies when y‚Äôall let your religion go to shit. Fix your people and he‚Äôll come back, is that not how it works?"
30,So.. who exactly has he been praying to?
31,Friendly reminder this guy has his height and IQ in his Twitter tag now
32,He wasn't a very powerful god then.
33,I thought it got replaced by Trump.
34,Big thanks to trans people for killing god üôè
35,"‚Ä¶all of them? Cause like, trans people are still people and I would NOT trust a committee of that size to get ANYTHING done."

38,I am now god
39,BiGod he‚Äôs right!
40,Why do transphobics always make us sound more badass
41,"Did he die of shame? Because if what I know of him from the Bible is anything to go by, he fucking should have!"
42,Win win situation
43,"In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing. But because, I am horny for girldick"
44,congratulations to the trans community for usurping God
45,# Trans people don't ask for my money.
46,"God is indeed dead. If it has been replaced by trans people, then some certain people better start getting on their knees and apologizing for being the bigoted shits they are."
47,"Beginning of the church of the trans ? 
Are they all gods or just collectively one god?
How should I pray now?"
48,I AM GOD!
49,yay I‚Äôm god now
50,I see this as an absolute win.
51,Sounds like a better world
52,But being anti Trans makes you racist. So being against God makes you...?
53,"Yep it's true, next we're going to tear down the churchesüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"
54,"Our trans people, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy pronouns;"
55,"If Jesus was divinely conceived by Mary with no XY chromosomes being donated, and Jesus identified as a guy, then he was clearly transmasc. Checkmate."
56,"God remains dead, and the trans have killed him."
57,Better than a Cheeto jesus
58,Kneel before me mortals

But I have more respect for trans people -- they're not sending their fan club out to tell me how to live my life."
79,Finally!
80,"I mean, I‚Äôm not even trans but that just seems like an upgrade, god‚Äôs a dick"
81,I feel safer in their hands than in the hands of their hate god.
82,"Thought God was supposed to be an all powerful being that's unkillable?

Better ask my partner how she'd like to be worshipped though."
83,Im fine with that. The trans people I know have shown far more empathy than any god I‚Äôve heard of.
84,"Hell yeah, we killed god! Time to make churches pay taxes now."
85,We did it!  I have so many people to thank for this honor ü•≤
86,"If there‚Äôs a god, they would logically be a confluence of all genders. Change God‚Äôs pronouns!"
87,Finally!
88,That's tight
89,Congrats to the trans community for accomplishing the once thought impossible achievement of killing God and dethroning him as rulers of the universe. Very impressive.
90,"Sounds like a weak-ass wuss god to me, NGL."
91,Mission complete. We can go home now.
92,I'm confused
93,"All the trans people I personally know are friendly, have awkward and hilarious senses of humor, and bake really good snacks. I‚Äôm down."
