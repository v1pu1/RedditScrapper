1,"10/10 comeback.

Gotta run the full lap. Ascend the Jesus cultist only to bring it back to life and feed it to Cthulhu. Keep that faith train going with regular sacrifices, keeps morale high."
2,Damn! Now definitely have to buy the game.
3,"They always talk about prophesies coming to pass, but they never say which ones. Curious."
4,God damn their drivel always is the same. And for someone a part of a cult it's funny how the person opposes a game about cults
5,Shout out to CptOmnom for the only response needed.
6,I like that devout Christian's profile image/avatar. Surely God rejoices at loli catgirls in latex.
7,Imagine being this much of a dork
8,I kinda want to see what happens next.
9,Because *their* cult is the right one!
10,"Going off what I know about the steam forums, it's almost certainly a troll"
