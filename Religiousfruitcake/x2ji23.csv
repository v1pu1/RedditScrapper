1,"*""gay liberal satanic atheist agenda""*

Thats a lot to unpack, right there"
2,"What is *Stop the Fomo* please?  Whatever it is, I seriously doubt people who watch it immediately start having anal sex with their fathers.  But...it does seem like this guy thinks a great deal about anal sex."
3,"Can someone please explain how a Satanist can be an Atheist? OR how an Atheist can be a Satanist? 

Also - liberals are telling Christians to have anal sex? Well, you learn something every day, don't you?"
4,"Oh hey I know this guy, he’s also the weirdo who called and lowkey threatened a YouTubers mom over having his weird Elden ring take put in a video

I thought his “I can’t be homophobic I’m vegan” thing was like a joke but OH GOD"
5,"It already read like satire but at the ""next minute they start having anal sex with their dads"" screams parody. Is this actually serious?"
6,"Weirdly enough I have never had the urge to have sex with my father, so I think it's just you dude"
7,The lies people tell themselves to stay sane.
8,"Funny, I don't remember ever trying to convince anyone to try anal sex except for my wife and it was most definitely not gay anal sex."
9,"This mofo is so deep in the closet, he/she in the kitchen furiously masturbating using their tears as lube."
10,"""Satanic influence isn't a joke, which is why the last sentence is self-parody."""
11,Would you be surprised to learn that he's also racist?
12,Would you be surprised that he is also gay? Seems to think a lot about anal sex and daddy.
13,He's a TV calibrator who makes YouTube videos reviewing TV's and showing how to calibrate them.  Quantum TV attacks other TV calibrators on YouTube so he comes up in their search results and the only evidence he has in Stop the Fomo being a satanist is that he used the Lucifer logo to test for blooming on several TV's.  I'm not sure where his obsession with anal sex comes from.
14,"It makes as much sense as the so-called anarchists subs here Mr. Presidenting themselves for organized religion, so it's hardly a surprise to me."
15,"This is a question for your average idiot FB user. Luckily they stay away (for the most part) from Reddit, prob because it's to difficult to comprehend/use, no pretty pictures etc...  I'm sure there are subs here that are full of this shit, but I don't want to sub only to be banned 5 minutes later."
16,I am so glad the act man was able to recover from that debacle of a interaction with that despicable piece of shit quantum TV
17,"> “I can’t be homophobic I’m vegan”

That's gold right there."
18,"it is, this guy’s background is insane"
19,So deep in the closet he's finding Christmas presents for the next 5 years.
20,"Not in the slightest, unfortunately"
21,"I can't think of a single moment during his beef with actman when someone told him to take it up the ass.


If it's not from outside then there is only one place these thoughts could have come from."
22,It comes from his desire to have it.
23,"The actual quote from Quantum TV is ""just cause I'm anti-gay doesn't mean I'm homophobic."""
24,I see.
