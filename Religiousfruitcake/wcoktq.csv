1,"Agreed. No amount of context would make that okay. And besides, ceremonial law isn‚Äôt even biblical. There‚Äôs just the law.

Edit: Great. Now I want cheesecake."
2,I remember getting an explanation at church where they explained how marrying the rapist was a benefit to the woman. Something about not being a virgin means that she would be cast aside and not looked at as being suitable for marriage.
3,"That‚Äôs kind of become a thing of mine, to just challenge them to invent a context that would justify such things. Not even asking them to show that‚Äôs the case in the book, just tell me what justifies this even hypothetically. Other than saying you‚Äôd be an idiot to believe this would be a good law, because even they know their bible doesn‚Äôt say it that way‚Ä¶"
4,"What missing context? It is a fact that the Bible says women who have been raped must be sold off to their rapist to be his bride. There's nothing missing from here, that's just what it says"
5,I'm sorry for focusing on that but the gay picture is fanart of USUK from hetalia both canon and genderbent I'm 99.999% sure about this and I'm losing my mind
6,"AHAHA THATS HETALIA BABBBYYYYY

Love my extremely homoerotic anime"
7,Bruh they really gonna use hetalia fan art like that?
8,"""If I still personally abide by it, Jesus wanted everyone to. If I don't, Jesus came to, uh, fulfill that law so that no one else had to ever again."""
9,Sounds like Islam.
10,"Meme isn't quite right. They don't have to marry in all cases. Just buy their victim. And the rapist can't sell her, and has to take care of her almost like a wife for the rest of their lives, but he can have an actual wife too from my understanding. And wife is just basically a slave here anyway though, so not much difference."
11,It‚Äôs fucking Hetalia fanart. I‚Äôm dying.
12,"There's no context it's just primitive patriarchal bullshit.

Like oooh the rapist has to take care of her now or her father could refuse lol

I've heard all the tap dancing. It is what it looks like it is."
13,It's not out of context anyway
14,"Ok, so actually is less about context, and more about the fact that this is just wrong. In the Torah, the actual book the Christian Old Testament is (poorly) translated from, a woman does not HAVE to marry her rapist. Rather she can CHOOSE to force her rapist to marry her. Because back in those days, a woman's only way of supporting herself was to be married, and many men would not marry a woman who was raped. So this law, in the context of the time it was written, actually was fairly progressive in that it provided a sort of way to guarantee a woman would have a husband to financially support her. 

Now, how this worked in practice, I have no idea. Could be many women were forced by their father or community to marry their rapist because of societal stigmas or because the father didn't want to have to support his ""damaged"" daughter forever. But based purely on the text, this was actually intended as a way to ensure a woman's well being at a time when few societies in that region were doing so."
15,"The girl's father (presumably as the girl's representative) can refuse.

It's not a good law by any means (the father might want to marry off his daughter without taking her feelings into account), but it's not as bad as people make it out to be."
16,"Me too. I had never heard of that subreddit before. I probably subscribe to too many subreddits as it is. But now i want one more.

Edit: after briefly reading the description of the site, i decided against joining. Apparently it is run by religious people who are anti-atheist rather than antitheist. And all posts have to be approved by mods before they get posted."
17,üßÄüç∞
18,"I like how religion made a word up for ""I had sex at least once before"" and then use it to outcast women (because let's be honest the men aren't held to the same standard). I hate the concept of virginity"
19,"It's another case of them thinking of women as property and their virginity and fertility as their value.

So to them ""you break it you bought it"" makes sense."
20,Unsuitable for marriage to the type of people that view her as property.
21,Which is horrifying because common sense would tell you rape doesn't count as losing your virginity.
22,"Fifty shekels buys her dad‚Äôs blessing, too. SMH"
23,"No no don't you see? It's a punishment for the rapist! He totally did not want that particular woman and will now use this as a loophole to get the woman he wants by force!!!1! See look, he even has to pay the dowry... to the woman's father...

What's that? What about the woman's feelings? ...What about them?"
24,Yes babyyyyy love me some USxUK
25,"Saw Hetalia art in 2022 , make me realize how long since that anime at it peak in term of popularity lol"
26,[Or Christianity.](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/deuteronomy/22/28-29)
27,"No, that‚Äôs just Christianity‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt get to blame another religion for that‚Ä¶"
28,"In terms of savagery, misogyny and irrational behaviour, Islam is way ahead of everyone else. Zero competition."
29,"And if the rapist dies? All his slaves, and his wife? They go to his brother... And then the brother is free to rape all of them, as they're his property now!

The Bible is genuinely sickening to read cover to cover."
30,Do you have a source would love to read about it
31,It's not bad that two men can take away the bodily and legal autonomy of an adult woman? Really?
32,"Uh, maybe put a /s after that so people don‚Äôt go Poe‚Äôs Law on you?"
33,Too many subreddits?
34,"The fact it even has a name is crazy. It's a simple;

""Have you had sex?""

""No""

""Okay"""
35,I got such a blast from the past seeing that art! As a teen it was my ultimate ship
36,"Islam has those rules too, my guy."
37,yup
38,"It really, really is. And that is why all I can do is laugh when I see people try to say stuff like how the America right is acting right now, isn't true Christianity. It's like what are you talking about? Taking others rights and doing horrible things IS true Christianity, written right in their book."
39,"It‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs *less bad* than a rapist taking away her autonomy.

This isn‚Äôt about whether what the Bible says is good (it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs really bad). It‚Äôs about not misrepresenting your opponents."
40,"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs remotely good, I‚Äôm just saying that the OP is slightly misrepresenting it"
41,"Way too many. I subscribe to numerous cat themed subreddits, political themed subreddits, some science themed subreddits, a few subreddits about learning Spanish, and subreddits about the dangers and absurdities of extremist religion."
42,"Holy shit why are there so many USUK stans here, is this where my people went?"
43,"I know, but this most likely wasn‚Äôt and Christians will deflect things like this to Islam, when their texts say it too. We should not be helping them do that‚Ä¶"
44,We don't need a devils advocate in here. Take the L
45,"The fact that this ""law"" or ""rule"" exist
Is bad the fact that the father can decide makes it even worse"
46,Yes! The USUK shipping gave us protection from the Fruitcakes
47,"well, Islam inherited a lot of things from Christianity, so they say Islam does it too, we can follow up and say, inspired by Christianity <3"
48,‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to represent our opponents fairly. We‚Äôd rather just hate them blindly and radicalize ourselves‚Äù
49,Honestly I was raised to be homophobic... and then Hetalia came along... and now I'm able to be the big gay I am.
50,Islam is literally Judaism part 3 and Christianity is Judaism part 2 so I mean yeah it had to. Jesus is a prophet in Islam sooo
51,"Sure, tell yourself whatever you need to hear to get through another day. But we all know that's not what I said."
