1,"Imagine what would happen if her power company got bought out by a company with ""Energy"" in it's name."
2,"Someone tell her electricity is ENERGY that gets ATTACHED to your house and electronics.

I feel so bad for her kids."
3,You cannot fix that kind of stupid!
4,"She is totally cool with believing in a middle-eastern religion though that tells stories of magical non-burning, burning bushes, people turning into salt and blood sacrifice appeasing spirits...but Pokémon is too far..."
5,So what im learning here is that clearly god made McDonalds...
6,Imagine telling her the food you eat gives you energy.
7,Are her kids even allowed to play?  Is that why she thinks energy is evil?  'Cause having a bunch of rambunctious kids full of natural energy is too much for her insane self-righteousness to handle?
8,"I guess she needs to move to Texas, I hear they don't get much energy from the grid there."
9,">Energy \[...\] is capitalized like it's deified.

Also this person:

>I knew Pokémon was demonic  
>  
>We got meals from McDonald's

I guess Pokémon and McDonald's are gods now."
10,Intolerant brainwashed losers
11,Game designers often capitalize mechanics for Clarity.
12,Literally forgets Christianity is an Eastern religion like y'all wtf is happening. Did they think white American patriots birthed Jesus or something?
13,"So I guess, middle eastern is not eastern enough for this lady."
14,I bet all my Bionicle sets she celebrates Christmas and other pagan traditions that christians adapted
15,Wait till she finds out about kinetic energy via a hard slap back into reality
16,I just feel sorry for the kids man.
17,Merika breeds a different type of stupid
18,Would like to see the inside of there home.
19,"""not allowing anything that's not of God into our homes"" 

Ah yes, I distinctly remember McDonald's from the Old Testament and Facebook from the New."
20,I only believe in this one specific magic deity . The rest of them are bad .
21,"The name of the English village of “Nether Wallop” is always capitalised, but Nether Wallop is hardly being deified.

Very few people will be praying to what happens when you run “punch in the balls” through a thesaurus."
22,"They are not God, how are they allowed in their home?"
23,That's weird I didn't think they had a problem with fictional characters.
24,I wonder if she’s one of those beat the crap out of her kids kind of Christians?  Child abused okay 😇…”Energy” bad 👹
25,Nobody tell her that your body turns food into energy
26,..but tynamo!!!! 🥺
27,"PSE&G called, want their electricity back"
28,Her brain would explode.
29,"Nope, but you can trip it."
30,"Because Pokémon isn't the mythology she subscribes to!!! …Never mind that there are some Pokémon that take at least some inspiration from the Bible and/or Judeo-Christian mythology… Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza being derived from the Behemoth, Leviathan, and Ziz, respectively (embodying the land, sea, and sky), and Volcarona being modeled after seraphim (it has six wings and embodies the power of the sun) immediately come to mind."
31,"Makes sense, the food there is just divine, after all... 🤒"
32,"See also: Magic: the Gathering, with like 50 different keywords that need to be memorized"
33,Probably
