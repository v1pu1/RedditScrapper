3,"Well well well. We have another suppressed member society. Can I get a Hail Satan?

Edit: Thank you all so much for the Hail Satans. Keep 'em comin'. :)"
4,"“I feel helpless and guilt ridden”

It’s hard to sell religion to happy, self-actualized people. This is why… 

“You are a sinner!”
“You should fear Hell!!!”
“You are unworthy!!!”

“But god loves you anyway”"
5,So disgusting. And Christians wonder why people are leaving in droves and becoming pagan or atheist.
6,"Think about it, god created everything. Therefore he created the apple. Therefore he also created the temptation that the snake preyed on. As a result, lustful desires are a feature put in by god"
7,"I wish people knew that they are following relationship and sex advice from a man who was in a celibate cult 2000 years ago (Paul of Tarsus). His unfounded, unscientific, and unsupported ideas have wrecked the lives of millions and millions of people. I cannot think of a worse person in history to give relationship advice and instruction. 

There is also a reason why the Catholic Church likely has (or very recently had) around 24,000 pedophiles. Remove the secrecy created by the celibacy requirements, and you would finally see a change to that problem. 

People need to start listening to psychologists, not religion if they want real, evidence based advice that works for a healthy relationship."
8,"Ahhhh yes. Good olé Catholic guilt. Had a fair bit of that in my life. I also thought I was hell-bound for being lesbian until strangely enough I studied at a liberal private Catholic university and learned about Bible translations and all sorts of other stuff the local church leaves out. Truly was provided a loving all-inclusive environment. There were gay professors and a Jewish professor and a pretty church in the middle of the woods that was made of gigantic wall-sized glass and wood pine. Students were never pressured to attend church. Other religious clubs and student led services were encouraged. The campus nun stood up for me and my friends when we started a gay/straight alliance club and spoke about the importance of love, kindness, and “all gods children”. There were definitely a few religious fruitcakes, but they were extremely outnumbered. One fruitcake who I thought was a friend definitely had me sobbing in my car after philosophy class when she said out loud she thought LGBT+ folks were on the same level of morality as rapists. Yeah. Good olé Catholic guilt."
9,"Alright. Say 10 Hail Marys, make sure to still feel guilty about the whole deal, and continue coming here on the regular to line our pockets with your hard earned money which we will most likely use in the effort to convert more people in something resembling a giant-ass Ponzi scheme. Assuming we don’t need that money to cover up sex crimes, of course. Go with God, son."
10,"I hope someone told him that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him and that he seems like a normal healthy person. Seeing as how it's r/Catholicism though, I doubt he received any constructive comments."

12,Please just let it go and enjoy your life
13,"If God didn't want you to masturbate he wouldn't have made your arms long enough to reach your dick. 

Trust the Lord!"
14,"“Overusing the Sacrament”? My homie, don’t let jesus have died for nothing - go to town on yo meat."
15,"This is heartbreaking.


With just a little step to the left, this guy could be living a wonderful life with an adorable bf, happy and fulfilled and overflowing with love.


Anyone want to take bets on whether the confessional priest is doing the exact same things this guy goes to confession for?


Yeah, save your $... 


There was a long time when the priesthood was the only viable socially-acceptable career path for gay men..."
16,Catholics must be pro in edging.
17,"This just breaks my heart…. Poor dude. 

One of my biggest criticisms of religion is taking good advice and taking it to ridiculous extremes. 

If you are a compassionate person, avoiding greed, gluttony, lust, wrath, pride, sloth, envy. The seven deadly sins are about *excess* not the existence of these feeling/urges.  You have to eat, but eating everyone’s dinner is mean. Being angry with a neighbor for throwing trash in your yard is fine, but burning down his house for that is not. 

Sexual feelings are pretty much a chemical reaction in your brain. Staying home to whack off 24/7, missing work family etc is a problem. But feeling desire?!? Why punish oneself?"
18,"They're a bad person for supporting a religion that makes people question things like this over total nonsensical, fictional crap."
19,Kinda related: Porn addiction is a real thing thay ruins people's lives. The modern ease of access to the internet has only made it worse.
20,XD That made me laugh. Thank you kind internet stranger.
21,This made have a good giggle
22,I struggled with it for the longest time as well. I grew up in a catholic far right environment. I've since left (thankfully) but my family is so religious that they refuse to go to my wedding due to it being outside of the church (Keep in mind they married before they converted so they didn't get married in the catholic church either)
23,"Me too. I was raised very strictly catholic and it took me years to get that poison out of my system. But it’s been out for the last 53 years. And more importantly, I spared my children years of pain and humiliation by NOT making them suffer what I went through. And now my grandkids are free of the christian curse."
24,Hail Satan
25,Hail Satan!
26,hail satan

31,I suggest they KNOW. They just turn a blind eye.
32,"And even then, malakos was not meant to be read as ""wanker"", it was ""effeminate, soft and lacking self-control"". As well as arsenokoites was not really ""homosexual"", but more like ""pederastic abuser""."
33,Underrated comment.
34,Are we siblings?
