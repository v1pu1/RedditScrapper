1,"If she read the bible daily, she wouldn't be a Christian anymore. Checkmate Christians."
2,"""Follows her husband just like the church follows Jesus""... so not at all?"
3,"""active lifestyle""

""homeschools kids"""
4,"I like how ""hating guns"" is a bad thing.

Why would anyone love violence, besides sadists like the person who made that ""meme"""
5,This finally explains why all of those church folks always are in such great cardiovascular shape.
6,The Godly wife wears makeup?  What is she? Some kind of slut?
7,Alot of the feminst propaganda describes trump. Who bets he got a shitty swastika tat at 20
8,I forgot how every woman who is not an ultra conservative Christian got a gender studies degree. All of them. That's like 100 million women with gender studies degrees in the US alone. Wow.
9,"So, Trump is a liberated feminist? He checks at least half the boxes."
10,Funny coz the girl in the left is most likely raised by the girl on the right
11,"Out of those two women, I know which I would like to go for a pint with, and which I wouldn't socialise with if they paid me to"
12,"Lol, why do I feel they forgot, knows how to make jam from berries on the right."
13,Soooo the woman on the right has *a better degree* and decided *not to work*?
14,"You had me at ""loves socialism"" and ""doesn't want any kids, just a lot of cats""..."
15,"Lol, they say that's chubby, but most women in the churches I've been to in the past have been overweight, some even morbidly obese. I'm talking constant health complications, chicks that were 5'4"" and 265 lbs.

Weird how they'll bodyshame people outside of their circle while they have the same issues in the community, usually to a worse degree."
16,I love how the left was just insults not related to anything in particular and then the right is all about being devoted to God.  Like the two comparisons are in any way related.
17,Basically a bad woman is someone who acts like a human being and a good woman is a little robot to do your housework
18,"But on the left side, add “genuine personality, easy to talk to, nonjudgmental”

And on the right side, add “constantly wears a mask to come off as perfect instead of showing any real personality, too afraid of conflict to state her own opinions, will act like she’s nonjudgmental when she talks to you but then talks judgmental shit about you to her fellow Christian mom friends”"
19,"How does the one on the right find the time to do all that? Homeschool the kids, make all that healthy food, have an active lifestyle and many fulfilling hobies, pray and read bible every day."
20,"This has incel vibes all over it.

*While godless feminist was out having premarital sex not with me, trad godly woman was home studying the ~~blade~~ bible while also not having sex with me*"
21,Homeschooling: we'll always need convenience store workers.
22,"'Light makeup' so shes disgracing 'gods work'?
Oh she is going straight to imaginary hell for that one.

Its sad how 'proud christian and american' is synomymous with 'racist, hateful and forces childish beliefs on others'"
23,"I don't get it, was the liberated feminist supposed to look bad?"
24,The one on the left sounds far more pleasant to be around.
25,"“Loves socialism & hates guns”

Haha, everyone knows Jesus always brandished a sidearm and hated any sort of communal good, loaves and fishes, etc."
26,"""Her husband loves her as Christ loves the church.""

Dude, really? Jesus would *hate* the modern Christian church."
27,"Every time I see this meme it makes me nauseous. Lots of atheist liberals have active healthy lifestyles too. Just because I don’t believe in God doesn’t mean I’m a fat, angry, gun hating woman. Geez these people are the worst."
28,">GOOD FIGURE FROM HEALTHY DIET & ACTIVE LIFESTYLE

If you've been to a church, you've seen the people that fill those seats...and a lot of them definitely FILL those seats."
29,"-	Prays and reads the Bible daily
-	Pro Life

Lol"
30,“Overdone fake tan…” hmmm
31,The poor oppressed one on the right side. That life sounds like a hell scape.
32,"Or in the real world:
""She's an atheist, which means she is not convinced there is a god, due to a complete lack of evidence.""
 
Everything else they mention is obviously garbage, since they have nothing to do with believing or not believing"
33,Plot twist they're lesbians
34,"Excuse me, but how do religious beliefs determine body type? “I am SLIM and HEALTHY due to the GodBod Workout! I lift the heavy pulpit Bible 50 times a day! Furthermore, my diet consists ONLY of communion bread cubes and cheap grape juice!”"
35,"I don’t want kids and have 2 cats. Guess I know what my identity is. 

*proceeds to cake makeup into beard*"
36,"'Godly'

The word you're looking for is 'pious' you cretins."
37,I would never be married to someone who thinks children are better than cats.
38,Funny my ex resembles the person on the left and she's supposedly Christian
39,Ability to repair drywall?
40,I guess these people have never seen all those christian patriots at trump rallies.
41,r/GatekeepingYuri
42,"I lost it at ""loves socialism and hates guns"""
43,Her husband loves her as Christ loves the church?  So he whips her and tells her she has fake faith and she's not good enough to make it into heaven?  Not surprising.
44,"According to this, no woman in the world has a well paying job or owns a company.

The math doesnt add up. Somethings wrong, I can feel it."
45,Confused: does Christ want to fuck the Church?
46,"Yes of course, because women will only ever fit into these two very distinct categories. So closed minded."
47,Ngl both kind of hot
48,"Should have added for the Godly Tradwife: Never disobeys her husband, never complains about anything, doesn't have a mind of her own, will agree to anything her husband says even if he is wrong."
49,"Why do I imagine that if Jesus were alive today, he'd actually cringe at these type of people. 

Modern fundigelicals are more concerned with the aesthetic of being a Christian than actually acting like one. 

A traditionalist ""Christian"" woman (most likely married to a guy that can make six figures) deciding to keep her children sheltered from other people is the polar opposite of what Jesus did. The judgemental nature of the graphic is also opposite to what Jesus wanted. 

It's hinted also that Jesus wasn't a nationalist and was even judged by the ruling class of his own country, Evangelical Christians on the other hand rage for the machine and would ""crucify"" those who do not ""repent"" or convert to their ideology. The fact that they have political power to do their bidding is opposite to what Jesus had in his lifetime.

Evangelism is an evil that thinks of itself as good, Jesus was a good that was seen as an evil. Complete opposites."
50,"“Is an athiest”


Sorry, I didn’t realize following logic and using basic reasoning skills was bad."
51,"They’re not even consistent.

“Her husband loves her as Christ loves the church.”

Christ *is* the church according to a lot of Christian denominations. 

This reads as if the man who wrote this was rejected by a feminist, just spiteful for no reason."
52,What the fuck is this?
53,*Grips his hand and grins at all his court appearances.*
54,"Are republicans women really like that, the GOP would have you think it. Please can some republicans submissive women answer"
55,"I prefer wine in a coffee cup, or a whiskey tumbler. I love good wine but never understood the point of a ""wine glass""."
56,Tfw I look more like the girl on the right but am atheist and the bundle I'm holding is a can of chef boyardee
57,I hate this shit.
58,This is just stupid
59,"""Many fun fufilling hobbies""  
""Only reads the bible"""
60,Not like other girls syndrome
61,there is so much cringe here I may start crinkling into a ball.
62,Puhleeze. Everyone knows parent’s don’t send their kids to school because they don’t want anyone to see the bruises and lacerations on their bodies. Homeschooling is their answer.
63,Unironically I know a lot of people who are exactly like the left though which I find hilarious
64,That was a good vomit.
65,So the tradwife gets churchzoned by her husband?
66,The guy who made this is 100% a 4chaner who will die alone
67,">""Liberated""

I guess the quote marks mean 'so-called' liberated, when the other implies outright slave."
68,“Tradwife” is a white supremacist term. This one isn’t *just* religious fruitcakes…
69,It's probably a rotation of like 5 passages
70,If she read the bible daily she might have a kink of sorts
71,"Read the Bible daily usually means reading specific sets of passages from the KJV or NIV with an evangelical commentary on hand. Usually these passages come from the New Testament, Isaiah, or Genesis, so you can avoid all the difficult stuff."
72,There's a reason that Texas school district banned all versions of the bible
73,"Yeah that's a funny one.

Some of my favorite quotes they ignore:

""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" - don't attack sinners, they completely ignore this. The idea is that God will see to their judgment. He emphasizes many times that they are supposed to love and help the sinner. Not lynch them and protest at their funerals.

""It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven"" - being rich is evil, he says many times to give up your wealth and help the poor. They do not.

""If your hand causes you to sin cut it off"" - it's your fault if someone else's actions make you want to do evil not theirs."
74,"""And her husband loves her as Jesus loves the church"" ...was coming to the same conclusion ...probably not that much."
75,That along with a few other points lead to this being satire but as usual if it fools anyone here even for a minute then it’s more than enough for some dipshit batshit religious nutjob to eat it up in a heartbeat lol
76,She misuses her husband's name for her own gain.
77,Well when you go to church they make you sit up and down a lot
78,"The bible was deceptively edited.  What Jesus really said was, ""Love \[putting ten rounds of hot lead into\] your neighbor."""
79,"It's so weird cause most of the women in the gun clubs in my country have dyed hair, tattoos, are childless or only have 1-2 kids, would never dream of home-schooling their kids because they have an ""active lifestyle"", are pro bodily autonomu and love our socialist/commie universal healthcare. 

Most of all...they are heathens. In the 10+ years I've been a member of my gun club and associated with most of them in my state, I can count on one hand the church going, professed christians."
80,Or loving cats!
81,Did Jesus hate guns or not?  I forget.
82,"Jesus didn't particularly like violence or weapons either. But I guess these people don't read the Bible.

Matthew 26:52

""But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.""

\- New King James Version"
83,"and also, “doesn’t want any kids, just a bunch of cats”. who wouldn’t want a bunch of cats?"
84,She only wears enough makeup to cover up the black eye her husband gave her so that the neighbors don't see and talk about the drunken abuse
85,Silly atheist me went and got a law degree! What was I thinking?
86,"As a liberal atheist who makes jam from berries I grow, I object! 

Haha!"
87,"It doesnt say she jas a degree at all.? 
."
88,Right??? Like...Just @ me next time...
89,Because she gets up at 5am to have a good sob in the shower before hustling for 18-20 hours a day. Her “fulfilling hobbies” are performative scrapbooking Asshole Junior’s T-ball season to better fit in with the “good moms” at church and the embroidery she does for 3 seconds each night before getting up with Kayleighia again
90,"That's why she is terribly skinny with dark under eyes...but yes it's an active lifestyle.
Her husband works hard from 9 to 5 and later watches TV on the couch...
He will not end up on a comparison chart like this anyway, as God made all men equal...
No liberated masculinist or whatever you would call that does exist. All men are good."
91,Man that hits a lil hard rn. Just did a program with some kids at our state park… both supposed to be in the 5th grade and couldn’t read and I’ve seen 1st graders write better.. kids bragged their parents couldn’t read either! And they’ve both been pulled out of school.
92,I can see why the liberated feminist might be worried bout money since she only works minimum wage.
93,">communion bread cubes

Bad Seventies attempted-""hip"" church service flashbacks, thank you NOT. 

That and ""GodBod Workout"" cracked me up."
94,Yep she follows Christ's workout routine called CrossFit
95,Cause sher husband is abusive and hits things
96,Abuse kink
97,I'm sure that's it but still seems really boring. There has to be a point where you memorized all the passages.
98,Yeah there’s no way you read Leviticus and not start to question your religion lol
99,"*ACTUALLY*, the religidiots banned a bunch of books, including ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" (FFS!!), and based on *their* criteria, some atheists/ agnostics submitted the Bible to be banned. Given that it fit the bill, they couldn't deny it, so now all the books are under review. (I live near that district.)"
100,"Sorry to inform you but this is a legit, biblically-based teaching that they believe. There’s a verse that says just as Jesus is the head of the church, men are the head of women. And that a woman should obey her husband exactly like he’s god on earth."
