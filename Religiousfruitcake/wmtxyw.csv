1,I feel sorry for his ex but then again they prolly dont so
2,So he abandoned happiness for religious subjugation? What. The. Fuck.
3,"man, that must be pain in the ass to fight cognitive dissonance that much."
4,"Dude, it sounds like you're either living a lie or are bi/pan."
5,"I'm telling you here he didn't do it for the faith, he did it to avoid hell, the hell he's been told he'd go to if he dared **love** **a man**.

It's so sad, what people are forced to do just for an imaginary god. *sigh*"
6,Wanna bet that it’s a conservative lying to prove a point that it is a choice?
7,"Sure, that really happened."
8,"But when he jacks off, it will still be to gay porn"
9,That's sad
10,This is sad…
11,"At best fake, at worst religion groomed them into abandoning someone they loved because they're the same sex."
12,Yeah because a sexual identity is a lifestyle
13,"This story is super sus, I don’t buy it."
14,Larp.
15,I feel like thats one of those posts where OP immediately switched to his alt to drum up some bs for karma.
16,"Geez, gave me flashbacks about someone I knew who my friend and I helped worked through his feelings for another dude and basically his depression as a result of it. He later converted to Christianity after his other friend  got his church to love bomb the dude while his family situation wasn't good and he was vunerable. It's fine if its his choice to be religious but he just stopped contacting us apart from debating us about his choices cos his church convinced him that we were sinful for actually helping him recover from depression by not out right condemning his sexual orientation. All that effort into helping a friend and this is how my friend group was repaid. Honestly, all signs in my life just points to the fact that religion needs to go extinct because it turns people into snobby, self-righteous jerks."
17,"Im surprised he choosed faith, because in his place o would have asked myself why would god makes me gay, but i suppose he might think that being gay is a choice or satan manipulation, idk just theories at this point"
18,This is really depressing and I hope they’re okay
19,You know that dude's answer was fake.
20,Yeesh
21,Oh it’s never good to lie to yourself
22,Kinda just pity the man.
23,Religion is so stupid. It convinces people to hate themselves.
24,"It makes me so incredibly sad when I see religious types talking about repenting from “same sex attraction” and going on to live hetero lives. Like you just know they’re unhappy living their lie. I have a relative who was married for 20+ years, had two kids, and came out as gay in her 40s. Imagine living a lie for 40 years. That’s horrible. I’m just glad she is out and proud now. It was a huge shock in our family about 10-ish years ago and I think everyone is adapted now.!"
25,That's definitely wrote by a gay person /s
26,Just when you think he was out they pulled the poor sucker back in 😔
27,I bet he believes he's totally not gay anymore.
28,Oh great one more reason for the British to laugh at us get it together you fucking idiots
29,"Does he get turned on when Jesus is depicted looking kinda handsome? Or being stripped almost naked on the cross? Damn, I have a sick curiosity"
30,[…](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E6pP0YO8KGQ)
31,"Eh, sounds like the ex dodged a bullet here"
32,"That is the norm, not the exception. People aren't Christian, or any religion because they want to be and it makes them happy. It is because they are brain washed and indoctrinated in to it. Told to be or die in many cases. It isn't for joy, that is a fact.

Edit: Forgot to add, and they stay out of fear. Fear of the bad things they are told will happen if they leave, either to them IRL, how some religions will still try to kill those that leave them some places. Or fear of the after life they are told leaving will get them. A little is in the hope of the reward of the good after life. But, if that was the biggest motivator, they wouldn't have needed to create a hell to scare people in to staying. It is never about being happy with religion."
33,"Good, his ex deserved better."
34,"""But serving god will make me happy!"""
35,Brainwashing is really hard to abandon. It took years to completely rid every single brainwashed belief from my brain.
36,Only if you don’t lube properly.
37,And groomed by religon to act straight
38,"Most likely scenario:

""Yeah, being gay is a choice, Im now married to a woman and we are so happy together""

_wife engages sex_

_dick doesnt get hard_

_dick doesnt get hard_

_wife turns on gay porn_

_husband now ready for straight sex_"
39,"Well he never said he stopped being gay, just that he stopped pursuing gay relationships. I don’t think he would try to argue that it’s a choice, in fact I think he probably understands that it’s not a choice more because of his convictions."
40,That was my first thought. They tend to do this.
41,r/thathappened
42,"There is litterally therapy groups for ex-gay in the US. 

I don't find that story really strange"
43,"He is very much aware he is gay, it’s just that some people find happiness outside of chasing carnal pleasures."
44,Do you really think gay men are that horny all the time? You think they’re immediately turned on when someone is “kind of handsome”?
45,Fo sho
46,"Ya, we of course have our wackos where I live but if you try forcing this shit on an adult, you're gonna get your teeth smashed in or worse. My best friend's dad pulled this kind of shit on his brother when he came out. He started beating the shit out of him and just fucking with him mentally. Well, one of our other friend's dad caught wind of this and beat him so badly he couldn't walk without crutches for months. Guess who went to jail? That was the last time that piece of shit ever touched him though. We weren't big enough and strong enough to defend him so someone else did."
47,"Really? I was wondering it that was a make belief story, kind of propaganda to show how good the conversion therapy can be..."
48,"I am a Christian solely because it makes my happy, and brings meaning to my life, that being said I do not try to bring others to Christ past debating theology with friends, if they choose not to believe, that’s their choice, I believe God gave us the ability to choose. But don’t say all religious people are “indoctrinated”"
49,"That's true, but this person has been so brainwashed he doesn't even know he's miserable. I pity that notion."
50,I truly believe most of these people don't know what happiness is. I had to lose the love of my life (she's alive just not with me anymore) to realize that being with her was the only time that I've ever been truly happy.
51,I'm really sorry you had to go through that.
52,So either way living a lie
53,"For sure things like this happen, it’s just that the way this was written just feels off. Like propaganda. Just a feeling though."
54,It's homophobic to assume that being gay is just about chasing carnal pleasure.
55,"Were you raised that way? Then you were indoctrinated. Plain and simple. Never giving any actual choice in the matter. Told it is true before you could possibly know any better. There is a very good reason they do all they possibly can to get people while they are kids. While they can't think for themselves. All religion is based on this kind of brain washing and indoctrination. And they would all fall apart with out it. Can you honestly say you think Christianity would survive if we stopped allowing it to abuse our kids? If we stopped them from being able to force this shit down their throats before they were old enough to know better? It would die in at most 2 generations. Be nothing but a memory. Purely because it survives on forcing those incapable of knowing better to believe, so even when they can, they will bend over backwards to justify it."
56,">Were you raised that way?

No I was not

>Can you honestly say that Christianity would survive if we stopped allowing it to abuse our kids?

It’d certainly lose some steam but I can honestly say that it would in some form"
57,"You are one of the rare ones, but unless you were raised in a country with different religion, you were still massively exposed to it. And primed to believe in it. Which is the problem. And even in another country, you'd still have been raised predisposed to believe in something

And in some form being just those left who had been indoctrinated before. Even with them still being allowed to do this to children, it is losing steam, and less and less find them selves religious. Sure, not all will go as far as to say they are atheists, but they don't practice, and aren't actively part of any church. And this is with allowing them to brain wash kids and indoctrinate them. Take that away, and they will die off. Same thing as what happened to tobacco companies. They have taken a huge hit, and are on the edge. With out new products they would be a thing of the past. In just a few decades. All religion only holds on by forcing itself down the throats of those that don't know any better. And the church disagrees with you, based on how much they fight to continue to be allowed to force their bull shit down everyone else's throats."
