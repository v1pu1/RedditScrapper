1,"I aslo say ""shit""  
Like a built-in mechanism to cry out to fecal matter, reminding me Shit is right there  


Edit : 400+ upvotes, at this point I should really start a cult"
2,"It's because Christian parents say ""Goddamit"" or on the line of that, we just started to associate the phrase with times of stress or similar and the subconsciousness does the rest

Then here in Italy we have direct insults to god so not that much of request of help from him if you are willing to use them"
3,Fuck must be my lord and savior
4,A built in mechanism to violate the heck out of the third commandment...sounds like something the fruitcake Christian god would have done.
5,This means cuss words are also built in and ingrained
6,"I feel like there‚Äôs in my language more situations where you shout out to Satan (saatana or perkele, you‚Äôre welcome) than to God. But I guess that says more about Finland (and possibly me) than anything else. üòÖ"
7,"""Goddammit"" is not crying out to God.  Neither is ""Jesus f\*\*\*ing Christ"" which is my other go-to.  Where do these people get their delusions?"
8,"Listen I went to catholic school for 10 years, I earned the right to say God damn it whenever I want to"
9,"Christians can use this argument against other christians too.

I'm hispanic and see many protestants casually exclaiming ""¬°Ave Mar√≠a!"". These same protestants then spew vitrol against catholics and their idolatry.

Imagine if a catholic used this same logic against them."
10,"Oh, god!  He is right!  JFC!  I never realized this!  Goddammit!"
11,">I find it so interesting that in times of being extremely stressed, ecstatic or angry, that even non believers immediately go to saying His name in some capacity as if it is engrained in them by design. A built in mechanism to cry out to Him

Riiight, it couldn't possibly be ingrained by constant exposure to popular media and culture. Take someone born in the wild with no human contact and no exposure to human language, then kick them in the nuts and see if they say the word ""god."""
12,I do it because christians hate it.
13,Same way fuck or any number of other expletives can be used in multiple different ways.
14,"Lol.  Can't be that Christianity has wormed itself into popular discourse and lexicon by violence against minorities and that most Western countries have some variation of that religion.  No, it must be a divine thing...

Also have you heard some Spanish speakers cultural curses?   (I s*** on the communion wafer.). Pretty sure thats not the worship you wanted."
15,"""His name""

You mean the undertale song, right ?"
16,"I read this somewhere on Reddit and have used it ever since: Saying 'oh my god' is a perfect expression of disbelief.

Otherwise, I prefer ""Gawd"" or ""Lard"" when I'm flippantly using deity names in vain."
17,"""as if it was engrained into them by design"", kinda like the brainwashing and constant fear of the devil and going to hell being shoved down everyone's throat since childhood"
18,"Or maybe because we live in a predominantly Christian society most exclamations include God in some way, and as such it's the first thing we jump to."
19,It‚Äôs because everyone around me says it and thats how language works
20,"Just because people say ‚ÄúOh god, oh god‚Äù when they are coming doesn‚Äôt mean they believe in the supernatural.  Nor does saying ‚ÄúJesus H. Christ‚Äù when  they hit their thumb with a hammer."
21,"I didn't call Yahweh by name until I was an atheist because using his name in vain is a sin. Of course, most christians think their god's name is literally God. His name is also his species so he may in fact be a pokemon"
22,"‚Ä¶or, it‚Äôs culturally engrained. I highly doubt someone in the jungles of South America, who‚Äôs never heard of Jesus Christ, uses it as a curse word."
23,"God isn't a name.

God is, at best, a title.

God is a Germanic word we use in English.

People who think saying ""God"" could be offensive to an omnipotent being strike me as ignoramuses. Even when I was a believer, I never could comprehend it."
24,"I am quite knowingly and intentionally taking that name in vain. I have started training myself recently to say ""Praise Satan!"" whenever something good happens. A couple reactions alone have been worth the switch."
25,"Their god has a name, and it isn't ""god""."
26,"Out of all the things annoying religious people do, why does capitalizing pronouns annoy me the most?"
27,I find it interesting that Christians use the word Wednesday. As if they know that Wodon is watching over them.
28,When I see some religious extremist say something absolutely insane my go to reaction is to say ‚Äújesus fucking christ‚Äù
29,It's called an expression
30,"""God"" is not the name of the god from Abrahamic religions, that would be Yahweh and all it's variations in many languages."
31,jesus fuck...
32,Pretty sure He doesn't actually titty fuck as much as I suggest He does in my exclamations of consternation.
33,Or you know socially it‚Äôs the thing to say and is expressed in most media surrounding us as we age.
34,My go to is ‚Äúmother fucker‚Äù. I suppose I should be worshipping the great Oedipus.
35,"Too many good curse words use gods name. It isn't our fault. 

""Jesus Fuckin Christ"" is just more effective than Cheese it Figs and Rice"""
36,ingrained by design..... almost right. its a common english language colloquialism.
37,"Wait, so is using ""his name"" in vain blasphemy or not?"
38,"""Oh GOD"" is literally blasphemous to some extreme believers who interrupt it as taking the lords name in vein, so clearly hes being slow. LoL"
39,"Where I live (Italy) the built in mechanism tends to make us say ""diocane"" (god is a dog) or ""dioporco"" (god is a pig) or various insults to the virgin mary, were we created by satan?"
40,He never saw an Italian saying a blasphemy
41,"""Have you noticed how my cult has indoctrinated billions from childhood? Even those who consciously grew out of it bear subconscious scars! Therefore God exists. I am very intelligent."""
42,"Clearly this man doesn't know about Italian language, we have an entire group of swear words directed towards god, saints and every other character mentioned in the bible, often they are referred as animals or other disgusting things."
43,"It's like these people don't understand other cultures exist. This argument would work just as well for literally any other religion and culture as most have some version of this, with their god or chosen prophet. But other religions can't possibly count, because reasons."
44,"I cry out fuck because I get fucked a lot. 

Checks."
45,"Soooo...yelling ""Jesus fucking Christ!"" when I stub my toe makes me a true believing born again Christian. I'm heaven bound and didn't even know it!"
46,"And then they tell you it's wrong to ""take his name in vain"" by doing that. 

Legit my mom used to hear me say, ""oh my god,"" and she'd look at me sadly like I was a stray animal in one of those black and white shelter commercials that she wanted to help but couldn't. Somehow this was the most heartbreaking thing in the world. And then I'd be yelled at whenever my severe mental health issues caused me to want to unalive. THAT wasn't heartbreaking- apparently THAT was just devious manipulation and made me a sneaky con artist."
47,It's just a figure of speech god damnit!
48,Oh my Santa Claus
49,"Someone doesn‚Äôt know about taking his name in vain. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing, dipshit."
50,"i typically say ""motherfucker"" in some fashion so im not entirely sure homeboy is even talking about. side note, the more upset i am the longer i draw out the word mother."
51,"Yeah, it's me crying out to God when I say 'jesus cocksucking christ"" when in angry."
52,"ah so cock, shit, and the action of intercourse are my personal saviors"
53,"All I can think about is a woman crying out for God while getting railed and her boyfriend says ""Why you calling for? I'm right here."""
54,JFC every damn time
55,"""I find it so interesting that people that claim to talk other languages still cuss in their native language. That must be because they don't really know our language and are faking it!"""
56,I say ‚Äúholy crackers‚Äù
57,Whack. A. Doodle.
58,When I say 'oh god' I'm not talking about any particular god just like when I say 'oh shit' I'm not talking about any particular shit....
59,It would blow this guy's mind to discover who the days of the week are named after.
60,"I did it originally to make my parents mad (""lord's name in vain"" thing...) And now it's automatic. 

But same with the others, unless there's a god of shit I don't see how he finds it a useful argument."
61,Jesus tittyfucking Christ what an idiot
62,I love blasphemy
63,"Irony: praising god for his good work making atheists say his name when they‚Äôre angry/shagging/laughing/etc, whilst not comprehending that doing so breaks the 3rd commandment."
64,Ah for god sake
65,Probably just watched a Sykkuno stream.
66,"It's almost like they're part of the *language*.  In fact, it's almost like languages in countries that *haven't* been centres of Abrahamic religions *don't* have the same curses and exclamations.  Funny that."
67,"God is not the name of god. God originates in \*gheu(e) ""To call out to"" or \*ghu-to-  ""to pour"" from root \*gheu- ""to pour libations"". It's not the name of God at all. It's just a germanic colloquialism."
68,"god fucking damnit, he got us..."
69,Legit made me ugly laugh!
70,The shit is right there in your ass. It's waiting
71,"What mystical force programmed me to yell ""son of a bitch"" when something hurts? Is the son of the bitch watching over me whenever I do something like slip with a pair of pliers and pinch my finger?"
72,"Fuck is always a popular one too. I must be a nympho, just wait until i tell my spouse that. Also in Dutch we dont call on god, we just damn the guy so make of that what you will. And then there is the ""achterlijke gladiool"" which translates to mentally slow flower and of course the ""halve zool"" (half the bottom of a shoe, yeah dont ask me) and the ever popular ""zacht eitje"" (soft boiled egg) So we call upon flowers, eggs and partial shoe bottoms for aid as well?

Really dont think this is the flex this religious oelewapper thinks it is!"
73,Fuck.  I just laughed on a conference call before I could mute.
74,Or Fuck. Which people say repeatedly.
75,r/beatmetoit
76,The Church of Holy Shit
77,You‚Äôll get a megachurch if you get to 10k then you‚Äôll be rich and fly your own jet
78,The flying shit monster
79,"Shit, cried the King! 
And all his patrons squatted and strained"
80,We also have a bible! The philosophy book ‚ÄúOn Bullshit‚Äù
81,"""Fun"" fact: the French had a nickname for the English during the Hundred Years' War back in the middle ages. They called them ""les Goddamns"" because the English soldiers used that expression constantly. It's been an integral part of the English language for at least a thousand years, but Christians are somehow surprised that non-Christians still use this culturally-ingrained expression? Their ignorance and arrogance are so annoying."
82,"Now I am interested in the italian insults. Here in Greece we have the legendary ""I fuck your Christ/Holly Mary""."
83,Bisogna riconoscere che noi italiani siamo anche molto creativi quando si tratta di insulti alle entit√† religiose
84,Made me think of [this advert.](https://youtu.be/gDgrnP-f8VY)
85,Holy fork
86,Fuck be unto you.
87,"It's my God too, Fuck bless you my cult Friend!"
88,I've got no award left so just now that this comment is my favourite of this post.
89,"I was coming here to say the same thing. I guess this genius forgot it's not calling for help, but taking the name in vain"
90,"Same with swedish. (Fan, satan, dj√§vlar, helvete, etc.) Sensing a trend with the nordics ü§ò"
91,Hell (helvetti) too!
92,"I say fuck a duck a lot, I'm not thinking about actually fucking a duck.

The ""bless you"" when someone sneezes has always bothered me. Haven't really come up with a custom response (it's so stupid) I just make a random noise when someone sneezes in front of me.

\*edit a word."
93,"Goddammit literally means ""God damn it"" as in ""God damn this cat for making me trip"" ""God damn this liquid for spilling"" or ""God damn this bad weather"""
94,John Fitzgerald Christ
95,Jesus Fried Chicken
96,CHRIST ON A CRACKER!
97,"Every day of the week is named after Norse-Germanic gods, except for the two named after heavenly bodies and one named for a Roman deity, for some reason. I am extremely surprised the fruitcakes didn‚Äôt change the names to the four Gospels -Matthewwsday, Marksday, Lukesday, Johnsday - and then the Holy Trinity, so we‚Äôd have Fathersday, Sonsday, and Holy Spiritday."
98,"A lot of us grew up in and around the church, and adopted the vernacular"
99,Sykkuno?
100,May It stinks be upon you !
