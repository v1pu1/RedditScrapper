2,Apparently there's a loophole.  Just cheat on your abuser & you can divorce.
3,So the abuser can leave but the abused can’t?? Lmao also “escape the immediate danger” is literally the exact same as divorce. The two cannot be mutually exclusive. As long as you are married they have control. As long as they have control the abused is being abused. I spent more than a decade trying to escape my abuser and you know when I finally felt safe? When I got the divorce decree 11 years after I “escaped the immediate danger”. Men who have never experienced abuse will never understand what it’s like for a woman who is being abused and that shows in this comment.
