1,"Idiot Christian’s: Pagans are evil and worship the devil! 

Pagans: I love this fucking tree!"
2,"""Christians offended"" are all the words we really needed. Because who cares what they're offended by this time, since they're not at all offended by child predators?"
3,"on an unrelated note, I think this show is legitimately pretty funny and well written enough for an FX comedy"
4,"Freedom of religion? Actually, the normalization of paganism and other non-christian faiths sounds a lot like actual freedom of religion and religious expression. Or is this possible Christian trying to say that freedom of religion should be the same as the ability to force their particular faith down everyone’s throats and suppress non-christian faiths like some scumbag?"
5,"If you're not a Christian, you probably weren't taught the lie that paganism is some deep, dark evil thing, probably associated with Satan. Maybe you even learned that it referred to a large swath of world religions, many of which are still practiced today.

I also love the ""freedom of religion?"" at the end like even she has to acknowledge she has no hope of understanding what those three words mean."
6,"Hell, modern western paganism is actually really awesome. Of all the fruitcakery theirs is the least dangerous. I'd trust a Wicca long before I'd trust any of the older religions."
7,"> referencing a comic-con appearance by Audrey Plaza.

No one tell her Plaza once gave an acceptance speech where she thanked the Devil, her head would probably explode.

> Even if you're not Christian I hope you can tell how wrong this is on many levels.

I honestly can't tell what's wrong with it on any level, even if they weren't joking. Normalising paganism is no more or less valid than normalising Christianity."
8,Christians once again showing why they despise free speech and why christianity is inherently diametrically opposed to the 1st amendment. Funny thing is they are now openly say it.
9,"“thE LefT Are A bUnCH oF Sn0flAkeS!! ThEY alLwaYS gEt OFfenDeD!, No0Oo!! YoU caNT haVe mEdia ThaTs N0t ChrItSiAn! I’m OfFenDeD!!!!”"
10,"Religious fruitcakes: ""YoU wOkEsTeRs ArE eAsIlY oFfEnDeD""

Also fruitcakes:"
11,Is it even a Disney property?
12,It’s such a funny show.
13,I can’t tell what’s real anymore
14,"Boy oh boy, do I love my username and account theme more than ever right now. XD"
15,"Ah yes, everyone except Christians should keep their religion hidden behind closed doors."
16,Christians:  stealing stuff from pagans since minute one.
17,"Classic American facists:

""We want everyone to be exactly like us and not any single other idea to ever come up"" just to conclude their rambling with ""we want freedom"""
18,"""how dare the religion we tried to stomp out continue to exist?"""
19,"Yep. Freedom of religion. No question mark needed. Although I understand the implication and yet I have to tell you how batshit nuts some of these Christian churches are too, so yes it is a double edged sword"
20,Wait wait I thought liberals were the snowflakes? Oh wait
21,"Lol It’s by FX, not Disney. FX already has edgy shows and this is nothing, they made a season about Lady Gaga and Matt Bomer being a polyamorous  couple and drinking the blood other couples in a haunted hotel run by a transgender receptionis. 

They’ll just make up anything to find an excuse to protest."
22,To be fair this cartoon really sucks.
23,"One of the reasons I love modern western pagans, I fucking love trees and other animals, they do too. So I get along just fine with their kind of crazy."
24,"This pisses me off to no end. Pagans have fuckol to do with the devil. The devil is a part of this fools religion not others. And reading a synopsis of the show she is the antichrist and the child of the devil so more Christian element than pagan. 

Some people are so damn dumb they need a chair to the face I swear"
25,"Lol. Pretty good. May I add the following to it as well?

Pagans: Look at these cool gods from pre-christian times! Imma go worship them!"
26,Christians: *aggressively stares at forest*
27,"I love fucking this tree* !

FTFY"
28,"Yep.  

Eons ago, some fruitcake was bemoaning the imminent 'fall' of America to 'thuh paygunz', and I pointed out that the most notable changes would be increased environmental-protection legislation and ""Blessed Be"" Starbucks cups every winter, both of which I could kind of get behind..."
29,"> who cares what they're offended by this time

Because they managed to ban abortions in a bunch of states?"
30,Yeah I just watched the first episode
31,Where can I watch it?
32,"The ""Freedom of religion?"" was written by twitter poster Satanic Panic Attack Dog. By the looks of it, it is TST member and is pointing out the same, that normalization of paganism is a definition of freedom of religion.

But yeah, it is kinda hard to read at it is direct quotes from fruitcake interspersed with rational thought."
33,The Twitter poster is not the person who has a problem with paganism. Their handle is “Satanic Panic Attack Dog.”
34,"Yeah like bro I talk to trees and tend to plants


BoOOooOooOoo"
35,">Even if you're not Christian I hope you can tell how wrong this is on many levels.

Shows how absolutely brainwashed they are since childhood. Some Christians are actually convinced that Satanism and Paganism are literal animal and human sacrifices or something like that."
36,What isn't Disney property?
37,Yeah but I doubt they even watched it
38,"To be fair, Demeter has answered even more prayers than the Christian god ever did for me."
39,"Sheesh, you  admit to thinking an image of a certain forest _kami_ or mandragora is kind of appealing _once_, and Reddit never lets you forget..."
40,"Being offended and actively involved in legislation are two different things.

For media, they're just offended and ""concerned"" because it's ultimately financial suicide to muzzle media that sells. But when it comes to human rights, there's no lobbyist to argue how restricting them is harmful.

We can afford to ignore them when it comes to this, and focus on dislodging them from human rights debates in which they actually have allies."
41,"If it's a Disney show, on Disney+"
42,Good point.
43,"If you worship Demeter, I hope she blesses your crops :)"
44,"Probably not, this is an adult oriented show and it doesn’t fit the “Disney Brand"". So it’s most likely on Hulu, since that’s were they put all the things they’re to embarrassed to show on Disney+, which is most things made by Fox And this is an FX show, aka Fox.

I think the Disney ""connection"" was highlighted. Because of conservatives’ delusion that Disney is an ultra-woke, anti-Christian company."
45,"I dedicate what little space I have for plants to her. And I ask for her divine protection for my plants. My flowerbeds are geared toward providing a good habitat for birds, praying mantis, caterpillars, and other small critters."
