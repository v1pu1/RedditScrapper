1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Iirc, it is illegal, unless the employer is religious affiliated (such as a church) or smaller than 5 employees."
2,"Oh, I want to fill this out!!!"
3,"Is this for a church position? If it‚Äôs not, then it should be illegal."
4,"Kinda weird they bring up gender identity in the bible. Doesn't their god go by He, Him, and His? I am pretty sure they would be pissed if you used an incorrect pronoun on the Christian God."
5,Saw this on r/antiwork thinking it‚Äôs actually this sub
6,This us a major red flag why would any sane person want to work at a job that includes this shit. You know this is just entry level crazy what will it be like once you are in ?
7,Just put in answers that would offend them the most for the hell of it.
8,"I want to submit this form and put ""it's totally lit"" and ""agree"" on the last two questions."
9,"At a job interview for a company called service master, the interviewer told me they are a christian, God fearing company. I immediately grew a smile on my face and replied ""I am so glad to hear that. Most companies make me work 60 hours a week. Im glad that you guys understand the importance of spending time with my family to worship god."" He then immediately changed his tone and told me that they still require mandatory overtime that exceeds 60 hours a week. I was honestly thrown back by how quick he was to give up religion to make more money. I told him it wasnt a good fit and that i believed satan to be running these corporations to seperate us from god. He had a deer in headlights look as i shook his hand and walked out. You have to fight religion with religion to these people. Making it clear you are an athiest just grounds these people even more in their crazy beliefs. He will always choose his company over his god, but at least now he may recognize that those 2 things might possibly be mutually exclusive"
10,"If that was ever on an application, I'd rip it up and leave."
11,Too bad religion is a protected class so this is a crime
12,Gosh I want somebody to put this on a job application so that at the interview I can ask them their thoughts on satanism
13,I'd kinda like to apply there so I can tell them what I really think about their BS beliefs.
14,"My old man always said, ""Never trust someone who does business with a Bible under their arm."""
15,"Q: What do you believe about the Trinity?

A: it's actually polytheism based on the pagan origins of catholicism and Jesus is just a demigod but Catholics are trying to cosplay as Christians so they pretend it's monotheistic."
16,"Christians  man.
Can't live with em
And you can't feed em to the lions anymoreüòé"
17,That better be a very well paying position with great benefits.
18,"Please share the employer, oh please please pleeeeease!"
19,"Do you agree or disagree about homosexuality... ?

Well, I was thinking about the golden rule every religion should do above anythung else... but I feel the sollicitor isnt really fishing for honest people, atheist or not."
20,"I think people need to realise what the bible actually is. Even in Christian mythology it is nothing more than a collection of stories told by prophets, said prophets only interpreting the word if god. Therefore, their interpretation could be wrong. If not then they claim to know god‚Äôs will themselves, which is blasphemy"
21,The kinds of questions are normal if you are applying for a religious based organization.  I had to answer questions like this for a job with Adventist.  Obviously o did not get the job because of the way I answered them. ü§£
22,"It is illegal. The very first line of the first amendment says...

""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof""

They can't discriminate based on religious beliefs. Just type in ""flying spaghetti monster is lord"" in each one"
23,never have i ever wanted a post to have been faked so badly; yet i totally believe someone would do this
24,"Not illegal if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúchristian org‚Äù etc, freedom of religionüôÑ, but *is* illegal for non-religious."
25,"Here is my take :

1. I really like Trinity. 
2. Tried reading the Bible. It's quite the drag isn't it? It's one of the only 2 books I couldn't finish (wink)
3. Don't care. 
4. Don't care."
26,"Dunno about US, but in Australia its legal for Religious schools or other specifically religious institutions. But the in broader community it is absolutely illegal."
27,"Unless it is a church, in the us this is 100% illegal."
28,"A) Doesn't exist

B) Dusty ass book

C) Original version, nothing; mistranslated and manipulated for the Church's personal interests version, homophobic

D) Original version, neither; mistranslated and manipulated for the Church's personal interests version, disagree"
29,"Is it a job with a religious organization? If not, then it's illegal."
30,Unfortunately this is probably a religiously affiliated non-profit so it‚Äôs legal. But it shouldn‚Äôt be.
31,"""I believe the Bible says people who mix fabrics should be put to death"" would be an entertaining answer to give to a thrift store"
32,"I'd love to fill this out. Of course I also would love to never work there, so filling it out would be for funsies"
33,"It's not illegal for them to ask, but if they turn you away for the job then they would be breaking the law."
34,"An homophobic place,n I don't recommend working there and I recommend shaming him and call the autorities."
35,"They should simplify it. How many stars would you give the bible, out of 5?"
36,"-That's plain bullshit and illogical, it was made up by christian after some time since a the beginning jesus was a prophet

-just war propaganda, made by early population millenia ago, just boasting their strenght saying ""yes we killed so many people thabks to god""

-even though david fucked saul son, it's pretty clear about it, it's a very omophobic book

-that's plain bullshit, this book should be banned from school."
37,Sue the piss out of them!
38,I believe in Taoism‚Ä¶
39,"You go to the interview, and it's the two guys from Lutheran Satire who were giving Patrick shit"
40,Only 2 things to do here. Nope out of there or write ‚Äú no comment‚Äù on each line and see the response.
41,"When i joined my current company, there is a form that we fill out about you. 1 question is what is your religion. I chose to keep it blank but after 2 days..HR gets back to me saying i need to specify my religion. Being in a muslim country, i just wrote christianity just to be safe. I later found out that the reason for that is Muslims have a special holiday and they need to know if i am one if i want to take that special leave."
42,"You can't really say objective when talking about the Bible because there isn't really any such thing as ""the"" Bible there are many different translations of the Bible and everybody has different understandings of what is written. 
Yes the Bible is misogynistic and sexist but it doesn't really mention homosexuality, only in mistranslations of the old testament and it absolutely doesn't mention gender identity in the context of the question. If you think it does, I'd love to know specifically which verses talk about gender identity and your understanding of them."
43,This is illegal
44,"Jesus didn't say anything about it, because he was gay, and he dumped Pontius and pontius made them write a book about it."
45,I‚Äôm actually fine with it. It helps me weed them out and not waste my time. ü§£
46,Just lie your ass off. Waste their time.
47,"Fill it out then sue when you don‚Äôt get the job‚Ä¶

Or report them to the department of labor and employment."
48,Must be the land of the stupid and the home of the charlatan
49,If I see that on an application I‚Äôm immediately not going to work there. I‚Äôll have a pretty good idea of what it‚Äôll be like already.
50,"I‚Äôll take ‚Äúplaces non-Jesus Freaks shouldn‚Äôt work‚Äù for $800 please, Alex!"
51,Fill out the application with the answers they wanna hear. Get the job. Record yourself getting fired for being atheist. Make millions of your lawsuit. Enjoy your life free of work xD
52,Either you have answers to those questions or you bin the paper and make sure you never happen across a vacancy from that company again.
53,*should* be illegal if it isn't
54,"1. None, I don't believe in it.
2. An ancient relic of the past that is irrelevant today.
3. The Bible is not an authority on human sexuality so it's credibility towards the topic is non-existent.
4. Disagree. No sane person should take the Bible as a guide for human sexuality."
55,"Why exactly 5 employees? I‚Äôm assuming your talking about an American law, I‚Äôm not from the States so I‚Äôve never heard of that."
56,"If I remember right from the original post, this is a job at a thrift store, so probably religiously affiliated non-profit and as such can legally do this."
57,Would a hospital count as religious affiliated? I had filled out an application for their kitchen and had similar questions including one verifying I was Christian. Its locally known as the religious hospital with a little church in it.
58,"Based on what?

They're asking questions. It's obviously to weed out people they dislike, which would be discriminatory, but it doesn't say so explicitly. 

I guess somebody would have to prove they were discriminated against based on their answers 

AND

the employer is not a religious organisation 


AND 

They have more than 5 employees...

People are used to jump the gun on the internet, but context is important..."
59,Do it!
60,"1. The concept of the trinity is one stolen from vadic religions and pagan/traditional religions, as are many of the concepts of Christianity. It's a device designed to fill a gap in knowledge and explain away some particularly logic defying stories such as how can God be God and have a son who is also God and a human but there only be one God.
2. I believe the Bible is a poorly edited record of some aspects of some things that happened over a 2000 year period in a very small, very specific part of the world. It has been heavily edited to reflect the views of a very small number of powerful people and maintain the hegemony of those people and organisations.
3. The Bible says almost nothing about homosexuality, there are some English mistranslations which misrepresent incest as homosexuality but the original texts have nothing negative to say about homosexuality. The Bible has far more to say about loving each other, leaving judgement up to God and not condemning each other for perceived acts against God when you yourself are committing your own sins.
4. The Bible has nothing at all to say about gender identity... So essentially, I agree with that concept of saying nothing about gender identity because how somebody chooses to live their own life has fuck all to do with me and my views. 

Did I get the job?
(Also ex fruitcake)"
61,Me too!!! üòà
62,I say we all SPAM it.
63,"1. Made up nonsensical gibberish. 

2. The Bible is Mytho History, little bits of history mixed with a lot of ancient Mythology. 

3. It says gay people should be murdered, and it's thier own fault for being gay.

4. Disagree, if the Bible authors calling for murdering gay people were alive today they'd belong in jail."
64,"No clue I got it from the r/antiwork sub

So you can be prejudiced against homosexuality if you work in a religious institution?"
65,i found the post on r/antiwork and it was for a thrift shop position... bruhüò≠
66,I applied at an Adventist hospital once and did not get the job because of the way I answered the religious questions.
67,I prefer the general neutral term ‚Äúit‚Äù for god
68,Sounds like a good response for the application although who'd want to work there?
69,"1) trinitarianism is a weak retcon and feels shoehorned in. 

2) It's ok, but it drags on and really falls off into a mess towards the end. That puts it somewhere around 'lost' or 'game of thrones' tier.

3) The bible considers homosexuality a sin on par with working on Saturday. Will I be working Saturdays?

4) I believe that Jesus was a transmasculine clone of his mom, but won't rule out the theory of holy ropes being thrown."
70,Wow! That‚Äôs actually pretty creative
71,"Isn't the Trinity present in all mainstream sects of Christianity? It's in the Nicene Creed, this isn't just a Catholic thing."
72,Catholicism would actually be interesting to study if they didn‚Äôt spend thousands of years scrambling to sweep their lore and magic practices under the rug while screaming ‚Äúwe‚Äôre Christian! We swear!‚Äù
73,And yet the persecution complex lives on.
74,Turns out it‚Äôs a thrift store!
75,"Yes congress shall not.  It doesn't say anything about businesses.

To be fair, a different bill went into effect that says business can't discriminate based on religion. However, there is an exception to religious based business. So a catholic school could ask these questions.

So you were mostly right. You were just referencing the wrong part of the constitution."
76,">nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof

You forgot this part. They wouldn't allow someone with open religious extremist views to work for the TSA. Think, if they couldn't ask these questions, and they hire the person, than the person requests [religious accommodations](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/internal/policies/religious-discrimination-accommodation) that go directly against the beliefs of the workplace (let's say it's a church owned thrift shop). What do they do then? They can't refuse these accommodations unless they cause undue hardship on the employer or other employees.

[""An accommodation may cause undue hardship if it is costly, compromises workplace safety, decreases workplace efficiency, infringes on the rights of other employees, or requires other employees to do more than their share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work. Undue hardship also may be shown if the request for an accommodation violates the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or job rights established through a seniority system.""](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/internal/policies/religious-discrimination-accommodation)

The only logical solution would be to immediately fire the employee. This, of course, would be problematic for the employee. Most businesses like this ask these questions beforehand to deal with it before it becomes an issue."
77,"This is an employment law matter, not constitutional law."
78,">I recommend shaming him and call the autorities.

1. I don't think shaming the employer would work, especially if what you're shaming him for is a core part of their beliefs.
2. The authorities are limited in situations like this. If it is a religion-based workplace, like a church or anything owned by a church, they have the right to ask these questions. They wouldn't allow a Muslim to work in a Christian storehouse. They wouldn't allow a Christian to work in a mosque."
79,"1 star. Lots of sex and blood, but the pompous and coy language make me think of it as a less inventive Twilight series."
80,Exemptions like that make cumbersome rules a non issue for tiny businesses as certain rules would have a disproportionate effect on them. That's the idea I think
81,Probably the legal limit for small stores with informal hiring?
82,Mostly since a tiny business can‚Äôt realistically afford a hr operation
83,"Has to do with the limitation of Federal law vs State law, an employer over a certain size is within Federal jurisdiction.   It might also be illegal under state law too, depending on where you are."
84,[r/answerisinthedamncomment](http://r/answerisinthedamncomment)
85,The thrice of us are all former fruitcakes. üòÜ
86,"3 and 4 are just objectively not true ... The Bible (both the Old and New Testament) is EXTREMELY misogynistic, gender essentialist and anti-sex in general, but especially any form of sex that isn't ""a guy sticking his dick in his female property's vagina""."
87,"Regarding 3 and 4:

3.If Jesus wants us to love each other as humans no matter what, then why does sexuality matter?

4.The Bible does not specifically condemn homosexuality. And clearly it condemns discrimination based on gender identity. If men are encouraged to love one another, is homosexuality forbidden? Also according to Galatians 3:28, there is no ‚Äúman or woman‚Äù for we are all one in Christ‚Ä¶"
88,"I know of a church near where i live that had a question like that so they could try and weed out the homophobic pastor applicants, but they changed it not long after because progressive people took it as a red flag not to work there."
89,"If it‚Äôs not illegal, then I need to get the fuck out of America when I‚Äôm able."
90,The thrift shop is probably owned by a church. Even if it's for-profit they're allowed to discriminate in hiring.
91,"Like I said, I hope it‚Äôs illegal, otherwise I‚Äôm doing what I can to leave America"
92,"""forgive them, father, for they know not what they do"" really breaks the whole trinity concept... Unless he was talking to himself?"
93,How are they not Christian?
94,"That begs the question, why are religious schools allowed to exist? 

They all take taxpayer money. So why can't we fill up the school full of every other religious ideology along with the most successful cult in the US."
95,"Shame him a lot and leave this crap of a country that haven't anti discrimination laws affecting every institution including religious one.

Canada would have fine his homophobic ass."
96,jwdr2004 is completely correct here.  This is exactly why.
97,Count me in too!
98,"‚ÄúThrice‚Äù means *three times*. It‚Äôs like ‚Äútwice,‚Äù but with three instead of two."
99,"I've been saying that for years, still need to."
100,"~~""Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) prohibits federal agencies from discriminating against employees or applicants for employment because of their religious beliefs in hiring, firing and other terms and conditions of employment.""~~
