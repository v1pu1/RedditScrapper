1,"Who the fuck would pick a dinner date with Jesus, even with a more realistic amount of cash offered?"
2,Does this man not know how much money $1 trillion dollars is? Ain't no way anything Jesus has to say is worth more than $1. Trillion. Dollars. I'd flip the table that Jesus was eating at for that type of money
3,"I don't get why they made the dinner only 10 minutes long... no, wait, I do. It's an exercise in ""look how rightious I am for declaring even a second with Jesus is better than any amount of money!""

But like, how inconsiderate. Waking Jesus up from his near 2000 year long nap and making him scoff down dinner in 10 minutes? Dude would end up with indigestion."
4,"Imagining the look of horror on the faces of white Christian folks who choose Jesus only to be sat face to face with a very obviously not-White, non-English speaking man from 2000 years ago."
5,...What does prayer do then? I thought that was unlimited talk time with Jesus?
6,I would take the 10trillion dollars thank you
7,Cash or check ?
8,Why 10 minutes? Does he have to die again?
9,With a trillion you can actually help people
10,$1T. Thanks. I could make a new Jesus with that.
11,"I don't speak arameic, so that dinner would be super awkward, but thankfully short."
12,"At that amount of money it’s a no brainer, take the money and solve yours and a fuck ton of the worlds problems.

But if it was a more realistic amount of money like $1 million or $10 Million I’d probably take the dinner, but hear me out. . . With that dinner under your belt you could easily write a book, do a talking tour, charge for encounters, go on talk shows, and make a fuckton of money."
13,A trillion dollars would solve all my problems forever. I could honestly probably fix up my entire town too.
14,"\>enough riches to fix some MAJOR world problems

\>a small fraction of a day spent with an imaginary friend

The choice is obvious"
15,"Lmao if you are a Christian you literally believe that you will spend an **eternity** with Jesus 

Imagine throwing away a trillion dollars for an extra 10 minutes"
16,"10 minutes because he skips out, leaving me with the bill. 

No thanks."
17,What would I even talk to Jesus about ? Technology ? Movies ? Music ?
18,"Wait, does it magically make it so Jesus exists?

If it does I probably wouldn't want to even more. A few thousand people going to heaven isn't worth 10s of billions in hell."
19,"Let's bite. Imagine you are a believer, and not as genocidal as on average.

Do you spend 10 minutes to have ""dinner"" with Jesus, son of God, for your own amusement? Let's even assume this is not a sin of pride, but it indeed does save your soul and give you, and you alone, spiritual enlightenment.

Or do you change lives of millions or billions of people? Even assuming giving everyone in the world several kilograms of pamphlets about Jesus is help and it'll save some of their souls, one is way less than many. However, it's easy to misconstrue the choice as greed.

Hell, the ideal fruitcake God would send you to Hell for eternity for picking either option."
20,"They’re probs gonna pull some bs about how Jesus is around us all the time and think of him while you have dinner, smh"
21,Clearly he doesn't know the extent that my insatiable greed reaches.
22,Now why would I want a date with a nutjob that thinks he can talk to god?
23,Religious Leaders: I can sell you dinner with Jesus for all the money you have. How much money do you have?
24,"I mean Jesus wouldn't even understand me, and I wouldn't understand him. His palate would be quite different as well. The sheer fact that I am as white as I am may be startling to the dude."
25,"Jesus would have wanted you to take the money because then you would be able to do a lot of good in the world with that amount. Like you can still be modest. Just don’t spend it all on your self 

If Jesus found out what you gave up for a 10 minute dinner date with Him He would probably be like “you made the wrong decision man”."
26,Wait WhT.  A sub I can join
27,Honestly would do the 10 minute talk with Jesus and ask him why he started a cult.
28,Gas prices lately? If gas was free I’d still take the loot.
29,Meet jesus... I wanna know what the fuck is wrong with me
30,How about $1 trillion and I buy and have dinner with every real person named Jesus? I think that would be way more interesting and fun.
31,He can't produce either of the prizes.
32,Jesus would probably wanna get dear ole daddy when he sees the shit storm this world is in rn. Ao I'll take the 1T dollars please.
33,"Seriously now: one million dollars, or a dinner with Captain Picard. Or Luke Skywalker, if you prefer."
34,"Dinner with a Magician sounds exhausting, i'll take $1trillion and actually solve the worlds problems with it."
35,We all know what happened after the last supper with Jesus.
36,"Even assuming Jesus was a real guy and not the parable character made up completely by Saul of Tarsus that he really is, it's still a bad deal. 

Let's assume Jesus Christ is who they say he is: A real, once-existing demigod child/avatar of Iehovah. He's eternally 35 years old. And let's even give these people their stupid ""Jesus was a brown-haired, white guy who looked like he just stepped into Jerusalem via Albion"" instead of assuming he's a brown-skinned middle easterner, because that makes the western world nervous for some reason. Let's give them all their modern tropes about Jesus. 

Even with all that, WHY would you want to have dinner with him? What could he possibly offer? He's not going to tell you the secrets of the universe over a dinner date. He's not going to give you a special key to a bigger mansion in Heaven. Anything you ask him will likely be met with a wise-sounding but otherwise vague answer that boils down to ""be a good person and obey God and we'll see how it all works out.""

So what's the point? He said all he needed to say before he departed. He even SAID he said all he needed to say before he departed. 

No, man... Even if he existed, Jesus would want me to take the trillion dollars because he knows I would find having a trillion dollars **ridiculous** and I would give away billions to do exactly what the Biblical Jesus *said* we should be doing: Helping the less fortunate among us. 

With a trillion dollars, I could help SO many people and I'd *still* be a billionaire or millionaire. With a trillion dollars, I could put 100 million dollars into investments and live on that for the rest of my life and the lives of my descendants, while dedicating massive amounts of money to pushing for universal health care, homes for everyone, the end of fascism, doing whatever I can to help deal with the consequences of climate change (can't stop it now, but we can adapt and stop making it worse), and so much more. I could set up scholarships, gift grants to scientific study, and even make some truly evil, destructive people disappear if I were so inclined (destroying evil isn't evil itself; Jesus would approve!)

A trillion dollars? Come on, man. It's not even a question. With a trillion dollars I could do more good for the world than most followers of Jesus *ever* did, and I wouldn't be living a shabby life myself, either."
37,"Get 1 trillion, 

do good with 1trillion.

Die being the most real and beloved humanitarian 

Meet Jesus (say he's real and so is heaven) 

Have dinner with him for eternity.

This is why people need education..smh"
38,I literally could solve so many problems with that much money... I could literally higher people to solve the problems of the people who helped me solve the problems
39,"""Instantly solve every financial problem you and your family would ever have for the next 100 generations, or spend 10 minutes with some old dead dude who was whacked out of his gord?"""
40,"Is this Jesus, the god? Or Jesus, the man? I could argue that as god it would be obv to have dinner. Come well prepared with questions about the mysteries humans spend trillions on trying to solve, and get answers to them all. And also ask for some lotto jackpot numbers. If Jesus as a man, then I'd just take the money, and then maybe buy his book that has all the stuff he wants to talk about anyway."
41,I'd have dinner with Jesus so I could take a picture of him and show the world he isn't white.
42,1$ TYILLION
43,Anyone who picks dinner with Jebus is going to be super disappointed when a dark skinned hippie shows up and spends all 10 min ranting about the Republicans doing stuff he doesn't agree with.
44,A 10 minutes dinner ? Ew no. That's clearly too short to eat properly.
45,"""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.""

Guess who's already an unbeliever, so why should I care about Jesus?

Even if those dollars are Zimbabwean dollars, it's still 2,763,194,252 USD (a small 3 billion dollars).

Noice."
46,"Jesus at dinner:

> Do you know how many people you could have helped with that Trillion Dollars?"
47,how much is a tyillion 😨😨
48,"9 minutrs and 58 seconds of Silence and then ""You fucking Idio-"""
49,Only if Jesus is granting wishes.
50,I’d do it for $3
51,I’ll take a dollar over 10 min with Jesus
52,1 trillion would crash the economy so I’d happily talk with Jesus
53,I think jesus would stab me in approximately 132.56 seconds
54,I'll take the trillion to use for the eradication of religion.
55,I could go to Mexico and have a dinner with multiple Jesuses
56,"What am i allowed to do to jesus during those 10 miinutes, we could work something out dwayne johnson style"
57,what's he gonna give me a bread and a fish?
58,"It's not like the guy would have time to answer any questions, he's only got 10 minutes to eat"
59,Who wants to eat that fast lol
60,Is it one of those things where if you choose Jesus he gives you double the money if you chose him over money?  Cause that is something I feel like I would have heard in youth group.  Some allegory about giving up opportunities because you will be double rewarded for choosing a certain way.
61,Who would pick the dinner?  Your ass would just get stood up.
62,"He would probably not even cook, see these crackers that’s me. Bon appétit"
63,"Jesus had his last supper, I don't want to be involved in that again."
64,Is this an actual question?  Like are we sure there’s no hidden joke I’m not getting?
65,"You can't put a price on the number of people who will angerly argue whether or not it's jesus because he doesn't look white.

But you probably could resurrect Jesus yourself with only a handful of that Trillion."
66,Give me the trillion and I’ll take 100 dudes that look like Jesus out a fancy ass steak dinner.
67,10 minutes dinner.
68,if jesus ain’t paying i ain’t going
69,I'll take the $1 Tvillion doll hairs please
70,You know how many Jesuss I can buy with a trillion dollars?
71,"For argument sake, let's pretend Jesus and all the claims in the Bible are real. 

I take the $1 trillion and feed the hungry, buy medication for the sick, and house the homeless. Surely, in the eyes of Jesus, that is what he would want from his followers. I would be rewarded by being at His side in heaven for eternity instead of dinner for 10 minutes."
72,Fanatics. The pleasure derived from something imaginary. It's all they have.
73,"... 1 trillion, and then I would use it to actually help people. Dinner with Jesus just seems selfish"
74,You pick Jesus it’s just my amigo from down south.
75,"I thought Jesus was in your heart? I thought you had a ""close, personal relationship"" with Jesus? Gotta love how zealots are always proving that deep down they don't really believe any of this shit."
76,"I met a dude named Jesus,  he was a nice dude in all, but 1 trillion buys a lot of dinners."
77,Uf Jesus would talk to any modern Christians he would cry in Stock and disbelief how far his children have driven of
78,Heck I would take $1 instead of a 10 minute dinner with Jesus
79,"Wtf, Jesus would pick the one trillion over dinner with you! He’d end world hunger, spread love, make sure everyone had a home and try to make people love each other. 

Then they’d crucify him and take his money."
80,hell i would take the 1 trillion over jesus
81,"Even if it were just $1, I'd go with the money, especially given that I don't speak Aramaic. Although to be clear, if I did speak Aramaic I don't think I'd be interested either."
82,"Is this supposed to be a trick question?

Lol of course the money.

God is supposed to be omnipresent, and so is Jesus for that matter. Right? You can have dinner with him, or them anywhere and anytime.

Just grab a sandwich and start talking to him. If he wants to reply he will."
83,By the viewpoints of Christians you get eternity so 10 minutes isn’t a great sell
84,If you don't speak Aramaic it's going to be a pretty boring dinner
85,Do you even Hebrow?
86,💰💰💰
87,"I'll take the money, then I can take  Jesus and the all the other people I work with out to lunch every day for the rest of our lives. (Yes, there is a Jesus that works for us remotely from Texas.) We all work remotely, so lunch would be various places around the country."
88,I can go to dinner by myself anytime I want…
89,I’d pay him $1.00 NOT to have dinner with Jesus.
90,Imagine how annoyed he'll be when he realises Jesus doesn't speak a word of English.
91,IIRC scripture states that the next time Jesus will appear is at the beginning of the end times. So am I accidentally triggering the end times by eating a sandwich with J-man?
92,Ten minutes is enough time to make Jesus tap out in a fight. You can't buy that kind of historical prestige with money alone.
93,Short answer. $1 trillion.
94,"We should start a trend of translating this stuff.

""Something you won't ever have OR something you can't have? A false dichotomy I made up because I think I'm funny, believe in fairy tales, and am also an edgelord."""
95,English didn't exist when Jesus was alive. How are they supposed to communicate??
96,Money or Beat the shit out of Jesus for 10 minutes?
97,I cannot make sense of that… is it $1 dollar vs “10 minutes” (plural)? What does that entail? I’d still take the one dollar over a meeting with a fictional god.
98,You sit down with Jesus only to find out that he is a third rate magician who doesn't even know any card tricks.
99,i can eat Jesus for free any Sunday
100,"Could do so much good with that money, benefiting humanity instead of some selfish brown-nosing."
