1,">30 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth. 32 Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”

>33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.

>34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.” 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.

>36 So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab[g]; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi[h]; he is the father of the Ammonites[i] of today.


There's a part of the bible where a couple of sisters get their father drunk and rape him. I guess they were just serving God."

Not in the mood to break your back for someone? DO IT. The joy of helping their useless task will outweigh the years you shaved off your life."

10,"Because a man who thinks he's entitled to sex might divorce a woman who sees sex as an activity requiring enthusiastic consent and ObViOuSlY divorce is much, much, much worse than being in a terrible marriage where the man doesn't respect his wife enough to want her to enjoy sex"
