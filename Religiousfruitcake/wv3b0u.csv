1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"I hope they got it in writing and sued them for all they're worth, literal discrimination based on religion in the workplace."
2,"I can't say for sure, but this is most likely fake. Yes, religious discrimination happens all the time. But it is far more hidden, and harder to prove. They understand they can't actually do this kind of stuff. Not so out right and directly admitting it anyway. This honestly reads a lot like the fake crap you can often read over at r/antiwork. There is a lot of real stuff, and good points over there. Just like there is real religious discrimination in employment. But fake stories hurt both, and make the real conversation about the real problem much harder to have."
3,"perfect metaphor for how christianity is used as a power of coercion, and if you dont lick their boot in the name of white jesus, they outcast you and in some cases, wage a war of pettiness and hypocrisy."
4,I hope he sues the crap out of them
5,"Not a fan of this kind of fiction, but it was an interesting read nonetheless."

7,"It is, but it didn't happen, as the original post is fabricated. As Abraham Lincoln said: ""Don't believe everything you read on the internet."""
8,Is this confirmed? The uniform aspect is weird enough to make me think it maybe did happen.
9,"The original OP posted 2 different stories in the same sub at the same time (the other one was about some crazy anti gamer neighborhood watch and them making video games illegal in that place via a petition) and started contradicting himself in both posts in the comments (like being british in one post and american in another). 

I don't say that shit like this doesn't happen cause unfortunately there are a lot of crazies out there, but I highly doubt this happened to original OP. It's rather some copypasta or a vivid fantasy for some fast karma."
