1,Needle dick...
2,Wait when he found out that 99.999.999 sperm cells die in the best case scenario
3,"wHaT iF yOu WeRe OnE oF tHoSe EmBrYoS???

Well man, I wasn't. And if I were, I wouldn't give a hoot as I never had any capacity to care about anything."
4,"""pro life"" my ass"
5,"Me and my sister were made in vitro. There were 2 other fertilized eggs with us that were terminated, and my parents tried again a few years later with 4 more eggs, that were all terminated. My parents are both pro life Christians who believe life begins at conception and all that. I never asked them how they feel about this situation but I had never thought about it before. They probably don't regret doing it since they got 2 kids out of it and wouldn't be able to have biological children otherwise but they did get 6 fertilized eggs ""killed"". 

Anyway I like to see it as I killed my siblings like a baby shark."
6,~~This demonstrates how much they understand about biology~~
7,How many fucking Nobel prize winners did your mom swallow before she squeezed out your stupid ass huh?
8,"Ah yes. The injection of sperm into an egg is the opposite of the creation of life. No flawed logic there. (They likely think that the egg is like a balloon and it pops once you put the needle in…)

This willful blindness is just ugh"
9,"so they want to force people who don't want kids to have kids, and force people who do want kids to not be able to have kids 🤨"
10,I guess christians will just be mad at everyone and everything
11,"Ah christianity...

Christian: HAVE CHILDREN!!!!!! THE MAKING OF NEW LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, TO BE CHERISHED, AND A SACRED GIFT!!!!!

Christians also: DON'T MAKE CHILD!!!!! TECHNOLOGY BAD, END NO JUSTIFY MEAN, I ANGYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
12,Because an embryo has never failed to reach maturity after a natural insemination.
13,They didn’t think of this when they made abortion illegal
14,"That's one of the weirdest thing to me. The ""pro-life"" crowd is indeed opposed to IVF and other fertility techniques. I guess its because:

* this kind of takes the magic of birth away and is in some ways yet another argument against religion
* science is bad!

&#x200B;

Anyway, how you are able to spell embryo correctly but have zero understanding of biology. Special."
15,The people who are strictly against IVF kinda upset me because that’s how I was made. I’ve had loads of people tell me that my parents and my existence is immoral and disgusting even when I was a child. Like yeah thanx doesn’t really help the self esteem issues.
16,"I dont like IVF for different reasons. If you're willing yo spend $25,000 on the procedure why not do some good in the world and use that money to adopt?"
17,I've been shocked to learn how many conservative Christians are anti-IVF
18,Fun fact: the amount of aborted embryos in the process is -1
19,Imagine being so much of a snowflake you get mad at a literal sperm.
20,So you’re saying they DON’T understand science? Poppycock
21,"Reminder that the most effective way to get souls into heaven guaranteed, according to the logic of Christian pro-lifers, is to arteficially fertilize as many of your own eggs as possible and then immediately have these destroyed so their souls go straight to heaven. A woman ovulates an average 300-400 eggs in her lifetime and has about 300,000 at puberty, so depending on her commitment to getting souls into heaven, she could easily save several hundred to several thousand souls via the fertility-clinic.

If you want to do REAL soul-saving however: A female human embryo has up to 7 million eggs. If the medical technology gets good enough, this embryo could be aborted, the eggs harvested and a single fertility clinic could save millions of souls per day. Once we have artificial wombs, we could straight off start soul-saving Factories, devoted to Nothing but growing female Embryos by the hundreds or thousands for the sake of their eggs. The ammount of Souls saved would be in the Billions, all without all that pesky getting born, suffering and having a 70-99% chance of eternal damnation.

I challenge any pro-lifer to tell me why this would not work according to their beliefs."
22,"Christian UNEDUCATED fruitcake...

(But it might be a tautology...)"
23,proof they don’t even know the definition of abortion. christ.
24,My brother in Christ you assist in the opposite of an abortion
25,i’ll get downvoted for this but she’s incorrect but a little based
26,"I don't know, I just think somebody's a bit jealous.

#metoo"
27,You can't win with these people
28,I can’t even. Every time I see posts like this I think of the law school scene in Legally Blond when Elle asks if masturbation would legally be considered reckless abandonment.
29,"Because the vast majority of a women's eggs end up becoming living, breathing humans otherwise, right? Right???"
30,Lol TIL I’m a sin-baby
31,"It'd be mildly interesting to be able to see inside their mind and get an idea of what they think is going on, as they seem very confused about things."
32,Lmao 117 laughing at them
33, Just the embryos? Don’t all the sperm deserve to be human?
34,"For once I agree, though for reasons related to the actual child's health, not some cuckoo stuff about a handful of cells. Plus the overall cost. Why *exactly* not adopt?"
35,"You all got dick pic'd.

Rate my pic."
36,"Yea, and embryos too; a lot die. Like, a lot. Some are even thrown in the trash! as if they don't have any inherent value at all! Cause they don't. It's a clump of cells until it's put into a person and until that person says it's a baby and wants it. Otherwise, it's as good as a tumor."
37,🎵Every sperm is sacred…🎵
38,"""What if you were one of those embryos??"" Well I'd be a hell of a lot better off buddy, thanks for reminding me... Lol"
39,"> wHaT iF yOu WeRe OnE oF tHoSe EmBrYoS???

I wouldn't be aware of how shitty the world and life tend to be for one."
40,"Lmao it’s not even an embryo, it’s a fertilized egg, a zygote. These people really wanna cry about the possibility of killing a damn zygote, what about Lysol spray? Clorox wipes? Those kill microscopic viruses (which are literally just as alive as a fucken zygote). I don’t wanna see these people stomping on a bug on their porch & claim it’s fine, it’s just a bug, they don’t have a conscience, while crying over a damn zygote"
41,"I'd rather be the dead one than the one unlucky enough to be born in this hellhole. Seriously, life sucks. This world sucks. :/"
42,"unfortunately it was never about being pro-life, just pro-control, they don't give a shit about the children once they're born. pro-life just sounds better, I guess, easier to feed to the masses"
43,"They’re actually right in this case, so at least they’re being consistent. In vitro fertilization *does* result in many viable fertilized eggs being terminated. Typically multiple eggs are fertilized but they only continue with the one they think has the best shot at making it the whole pregnancy. The remaining embryos are “aborted”."
44,Not exactly weird when they consider an embryo to be equal to a human being. IVF requires fertilizing multiple eggs as most will fail or be rejected due to chromosomal abnormalities. They seem to believe any fertilized egg that is not implanted is some kind of murder. It’s unfortunate we have to share the same planet with these lunatics.
45,"Same. I didn't have people tell me, my sister or my parents it was ""disgusting"" but there were people from their church that believe they were sinning by doing it and me and my sister were never meant to be born"
46,"I think it's absolutely beautiful.  How you're parents wanted you soooo much they went through this to get you, unlike a lot of children conceived. And the miracle of the science that helped create you,beyond wildly cool."
47,"That is horrible. I don't care that people think it's wrong or immoral or whatever, but you don't tell a child that exists due to IVF that! It's not your fault, you had no say in it, and it only means your parents really, REALLY wanted to have you."
48,Because same-sex couples often run into problems when they try to adopt.
49,"I mean, it’s much more shocking that some conservative Christian’s aren’t. IVF is like a super abortion, up to half a dozen viable embryos terminated at a time."
50,"But do it in a church, and use a second needle to baptize the eggs just after fertilization. Foolproof"
51,"1 adoption fees

2 their choice

3 exactly what about the health?"
52,Dm it first
53,cant see it/10
54,![gif](giphy|l0HlBO7eyXzSZkJri)
55,Most humans are still tumors even when they grow up
56,"In that case, I’m worse than Hitler."
57,"I just read that to the tune of ""Everything is Awesome"" from *The Lego Movie*!!  😂🤣😂"
58,"Unless they’re being adopted by an exclusively straight Christian family. But by the time they lose that “new baby” smell, if they haven’t been adopted, they don’t care if they spend their entire childhood being bounced around in the system."
59,"I'm making a fool out of myself. I know this but did not remember.

Thanks for reminding me."
60,This was the only way we could have a child. Only got one out of 6 attempts. Adopted after that. All good now.
61,"People, won't you think of the poor embryos! Just so selfish parents can have a living, breathing child to raise.  *(hate to have to add this but... s/)*"
62,"Tbf, I know that but I would have said the same cause I thought they meant that they thought doctors needed to do abortions on *other* women."
63,"The remaining embryo's tend to be frozen to use for future reimplantations. I know a Christian couple who have done this and planned to use up all the embryo's created. Their baby was from a round that only generated one embryo so there's no left overs now, there might be if they decide to try for another. They are open about using medical help, and the choices they would make, and would not judge anyone on making different choices."
64,"No, that's not quite right.  You can freeze the other embryos that aren't transferred right away.  After that, you can use them for more children later on, donate them to other couples, donate to science, or destroy.  Naturally, not all of the embryos survive or are good enough quality to freeze, but they typically try to get as many as possible per egg retrieval. 

We did IVF this year, and we have several on ice when we're ready for a second child."
65,"I was just about to ask what the problem with it was, thank you!"
66,"Yeah, put them in a situation where they can only choose to save one. Save one living, breathing baby or 500 embryos and we’ll see what they value more."
67,IVF gang 💪
68,"Sure. The whole thing will also be filmed and broadcast live so all the pro-lifers can watch the eggs get fertilized, baptized and destroyed at an industrial rate, while a score-board keeps count of how many souls have been saved. We'll only need one initial embryo which we'll keep cloning over and over, see how many cycles we need to go through until someone admits that maybe it really is just a bunch of cells.

Coming up next: An AI which does nothing but generate images of Prophet Mohammed and a machine which prints Korans, pulps them and then recycles the Pulp to make more Korans ad infinitum."
69,"\#1. As I already said:

>overall cost

The cost involved is still high and its coverage purely a matter of policy, which should be somehow *justified*. It's not. At all.

\#3. It's a well known effect. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7026576/#:~:text=The%20risks%20of%20heart%20defects,but%20also%20on%20IVF%20itself). Not only parents are often the cause (hence the issues in the first place?), and the process itself isn't and may never be perfect.

\#2.  But ***WHY***? The only difference is genetic. Creating a brand new child *solely because of genetics,* especially how it harms this child like incest, seems a bit shitty when there exists a process to help an already existing child."
70,"I'm doin' my best, apoptosis just doesn't come easily to me."
71,"The system that is dominated by Christianity which perpetrates physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, at that."
72,"I knew a couple is kids in their teens who were adopted by a ""Christian"" couple who claimed ""God told them"" those were the children they needed to adopt. They had a 6 month trial period, and they sent those two kids back before they had to keep them. 

Christians suck!"
73,"It’s ok, most of this thread also seems to not be aware"
74,I wish you and your family nothing but health and happiness.
75,How on earth did you get to that conclusion if you knew the context of how in vitro works?
76,They’ll pick 500 embryos over a Muslim/Atheist/Hindu/etc. but guaranteed instant save if it’s someone they care about.
77,"Why is their choice? It’s their choice you will have to ask them. But it isn’t your business to meddle in

Edit: since you’re a coward who deletes his li’l child insults before other people get off work, I’ll leave my response to your deleted comment below-

Dude I never read anything. Especially not your study about increased health risks for IVF babies you are using to argue against families using IVF /people making choices with how they choose to procreate with their own bodies, on a sub that is very much pro choice."
78,"Thank. you. We are good now. Our in vitro son is working at Facebook and our adopted daughter is senior in HS. In Vitro has changed a lot since we did it. Had to give those huge IM shots of oil to my wife. I don't think they do that anymore? Anyway, peace!"
79,"They often claim that aborted embryos are used in things they don't like, I thought that was that."
80,What would Christianity be without hypocrisy?
81,"Dude, do you ever fucking read *anything*? Holy shit, you didn't even try to refer to anything I said, and your questions were already stupid and clearly inflammatory and stemming from total ignorance. 

Which you now confirmed, since you're speaking for amateur Habsburgs without even admitting being one. At the goddamn least you could give *your* reasons.

That is, if there were any outside of what I already mentioned, i.e. semi-eugenicist obsession with one's own ""heritage"" or whatever, to the point they actively pursue hurting their own children."
82,Nope.  They still do those massive shots!  My last one is tomorrow :)
83,Can I ask what these shots are for ? What kind of oil ?
84,A dead religion
85,"Dang, I wish you the very best luck and hope you have a success! We still have the photo of our son when he was only about 12 cells lol"
86,"Gosh it’s been 25 years, I’m not sure. The idea of the oil was thickening up the lining in the cervix? Maybe that would help the egg stick as I recall."
87,ooh okay thanks ! have an amazing day
