1,the voice of satan sounds lot cooler than the voice of god. kinda like a heavy metal vocalist
2,"Send this to The Transformed Wife, and let them fight."
3,"Show me on this anatomically correct doll where women won‚Äôt touch you, Corey."
4,Indoctrination is a hell of a drug
5,"Ah, fruitcakes, forever claiming they are ""moral"" when taking away the rights of others and gaslighting as ""love"" when it is the opposite.

Any fruitcake trying to debate that their feelings matter more than your humanity is a fascist and is the voice of unreason -- shut them down or risk your brain (possibly even your life)."
6,"That‚Äôs a lot of words when you could‚Äôve just said ‚ÄúI get no bitches,‚Äù Mr. Mahler."
7,This guy is a real shit stain.
8,My brother in Christ. I‚Äôm Christian and some bad shit in a book written 2000 years ago is wrong. Like saying women are lesser and gay people being bad
9,But he's right. And by 'right' I mean that's what his scripture says. He's wrong to follow scripture in the first place.
10,"Witches be cool af, so I‚Äôm going to side with the witches."
11,Worth linking this to every woman who tries pushing religion.
12,"I was curious if this guy is serious or if he was just a troll going after people like the transformed wife, so I googled him

good lord, don't Google him. he is a million times worse than the transformed wife. hes probably worse than MTG"
13,"Not a lot of ""clear teachings,"" in scripture."
14,He is sort of right in that bible is pretty clear on the subject of women not being allowed to preach. If you‚Äô going to be a religious person at least do it properly instead of picking out the bits that give you an excuse to be shitty to other people.
15,"I mean, this makes sense right? ‚ÄúI shall not suffer a woman to teach‚Äù and all that bullshit?"
16,"Oh I ADORE this!!!  YES YES!!! Fight amongst Yourselves!!!  MORE DIVISION, MORE DIVISION!!! FALSE XTIANS ARE THE TRUE ENEMY, THAT'S THE TICKET !!!!"
17,That cross in his username indicates he's a fascist as well.
18,This dude for real?
19,is that a nazi cross?
20,"Oh yes, send this to Abby Shapiro and Transformed Wife."
21,It's so funny to me to see people unironically use the word witch like it's 1322
22,"I joke that given enough control, they‚Äôll be burning witches in no time. 
Now, I‚Äôm thinking they actually will go full on 17th century."
23,I wonder what the Transformed Wife or Girl Defined would say to this?
24,What a charming man....
25,Wait so is this. Areligion thing or a 'i hate women' thing?
26,..... this is so dumb it sounds like satire
27,Enjoy that incel lifestyle to the fullest asshat.
28,Is that a actual quote? If so could say the specific verse.
29,Utter damned rot.
30,cue Bodies by Drowning Pool
31,"Voice of the gods sounds cool too, like a viking metal band"
32,This sounds like Aggretsuko - the milt-mannered woman who suddenly starts screaming death metal.
33,"I like how they're tearing each other apart, someone should tag the housewife fruitcake with that tweet that's basically calling her a witch.

![gif](giphy|MqmgMncJ6x7YA)"
34,It's either Ozzy Osborne or Randy Blythe and nothing in between
35,"Or, if you're a Jeff Wayne's *War of the Worlds* fan:

The voice of the devil is heard in our land!"
36,i'll make some popcorn
37,"Someone do this. And send copies to other female theologians. 

Or, to all of them."
38,Please?  I want to watch the shitstorm.
39,"Well, Lori thinks it's okay in her case because she only ""instructs"" other women. There's a 0% chance she'd openly disagree with a man (a Christian one, anyway)."
40,"OOH, HELLZ YEAH! The steel cage death match of the century! Who wins in the end? All of US!"
41,"Yeah, I basically don't know what to think of the post unless they get into it."
42,He sounds like one of those guys who won't touch their own junk because they think it's gay.  I know a couple of dudes who're like that and I won't allow them to use my bathroom.
43,"He hears Satan's voice when he touches the doll. 

A lot."
44,"Start them young, teach them to pledge allegiance to a piece of cloth and let the religious nutters in their life take it from there."
45,Worse than Magic the Gathering?
46,yeah
47,"It does look like the Iron Cross. It isn't strictly a nazi thing, but let's be honest, it is a nazi thing here."
48,"Abby Shapiro's one a them lizard jews. ""I shall not permit a woman to teach"" was Paul. Sorry guys but Abs is off the hook on this one."
49,Yes.
50,"*cute?
I'd love a band named cute bodies by the drowning pool"
51,"Or 'flesh is burning da da da da da, flesh is burning...'"
52,Having sex with a woman is super gay because she's 50% her dad
53,"no, cue as in a stage direction to begin"
54,"It's the ""let the bodies hit the floor"" song that used to be in every 2009 club penguin free membership youtube tutorial

It's the holy trinity alongside dreamscape and bring me to life"
