1,Could be a case of Poe's Law because this looks like a joke/satire to me.
2,Is that another way of describing Gnosticism?
3,This is some crazy shit.
4,"Whoa , these Cathar extremists sound wild. 

That's the kind of badass cosmology I could rock out to."
5,"I don't know what it is, but I wanna be one now just to piss off a right wing fringe freak."
6,Hoo boy that's a lot to unpack.
7,It is just a historical meme/joke.
8,I’m something of a Gnostic myself. Keep your rigid spirit trap out of my consciousness.
9,Of all the things to be worried about…
10,Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius
11,The Catholic Church and obsessing about weird strains and technicalities of theology that nobody else cares about? Name a better duo
12,"Yeah, if you're *juuuust* the right kind of nerd, this is hilarious. Signed, right kind of nerd."
13,"https://www.worldhistory.org/Albigensian_Crusade/

Apparently not."
14,"The Cathars were a much later cult/offshoot/heresy. Think 12th century France. Syncretism of Manichaeism and Christianity, IIRC."
15,I'm aware that the Albigensian Crusade happened...800 years ago. The fact that the person put this all in the present tense when Cathars haven't existed for centuries is why I think it's supposed to be a joke.
16,"Oh, me either. I had to look it up, just sharing for the crowd.

But maybe the Cathars are planning a sneak comeback. Can't be too careful... no one expects the Spanish Inquisition."
17,"On the other hand, Albi still exists and there are about 50 000 Albigensians today (75 000 if you count the whole urban area)."
18,Not if the poster has their way. There's at least one gnostic there and by god we're gonna set em straight
