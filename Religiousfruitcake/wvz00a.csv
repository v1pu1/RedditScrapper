1,So he wouldn't have died for their sins? Just started blowing Roman soldiers away.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2,"Do these people actually read the Bible? Jesus accepted his fate. He knew what was about to happen, and he still went through the motions. He could have ditched his desciples for a couple of weeks and not have to worry about Judas selling him out, but he kept all of them close anyway."
3,"Firstly, I didn't realize that Jesus would be able to live for at least 2000 years. Or are they talking about some other Jesus?

Secondly... wasn't he supposed to die? To deliver us all from sin or something? I feel like this person might've missed the point of the story."
4,"Jesus did bare arms, they were just nailed to a cross."
5,"If Jesus of Nazareth hadn't been killed, wouldn't that invalidate all of Christianity's beliefs."
6,"So wait...a living god that can turn water to wine, control the weather and create food from thin air needs the help of a gun?

I mean, I recognize the work as allegorical but if you think it's literal a firearm would be useless to him"
7,"If leprechauns did not wear green, rainbows would be a different colour.  

Look, we can all make up ""If"" statements based on fictional characters with no logic involved."
8,"If Jesus had a gun he would have to shoot his way through the entire populace as literally EVERYONE begged he be hanged on the cross, even though there was nothing they could sue him for."
9,I kind of want to think this is satirical but I don't know.
10,"Wasn’t Jesus supposed to be a kind, accepting, and forgiving guy, and accepted his fate? Fucking idiots don’t actually think before they do shit. They complain about how “Oh, your going to hell because you’re gay,” but they think they’ll get into heaven when butchering and misrepresenting God’s own fucking son’s legacy. Absolutely unbelievable, fucking morons can’t even get their own god damn beliefs straight.

P.S. I know I’m overreacting for one shitty bumper sticker, but I see this shit “Jesus is a violent motherfucker who will snap at anything even slightly out of line” shit EVERYWHERE."
11,Talk about missing the point.
12,if jesus ever existed in the first place he would not have wanted a gun
13,Gun jesus turns water into bullets
14,"He never would have been sacrificed, would not have fulfilled his destiny as the messiah, Christianity could be be a religion, because no death and resurrection.

Also, he would be some 2000 year old coot with a gun telling all the kids to stay off his lawn."
15,And there wouldn’t be any Christianity? Cool.
16,Call me crazy but I don't think Jesus would a. Know how to use a gun and b. I don't think he'd be willing to us it seeing as how he accepted the gate of crucifixion
17,"Guns didn't show up until about a thousand years after I died, smartie."
18,He is fucking god ! Wich fuckin god ever need a gun to kill some mere roman
19,Wow kinda missed out on the whole story
20,"Isnt he mortal tho? (lives for a limited timespan)

Also this contradicts the point of Jesus which was to be forgiving and show kindness to a cruel world."
21,Dumbest shit ever but hypothetically if Jesus had a gun then the Roman soldiers would also have guns and then his gun is basically useless.
22,r/whoosh the entire bible flew right over this guy’s head
23,Back in those days you'd have to go to China just to get a crossbow
24,See now this is actually ridiculous. Most of the time this sub is just making fun of peoples’ faith.
25,Kind of defeats his whole purpose. Doesn’t it?
26,"...and then humanity,  according to Christian doctrine, would never have been granted salvation. 

Pick a lane, please, gun-loving Christians."
27,I mean… I think having a gun during that time would be a pretty big deal.
28,Can't argue with their wisdom 🤣
29,"So, the Romans wouldn’t have access to guns as well?! Also, Jesus and his people didn’t have access to spears and swords, the weapons of the time period?! 

Yeah makes tons of sense…."
30,Not true at all lol. He wouldn’t have used a gun if he had it.
31,"I guess they missed the part where a disciple pulled a sword and cut off a Romans ear but Jesus said ""don't do that"" and the put the ear back on for the guy"
32,"If Jesus had a gun, the Roman’s would have still had a very capable military to take him out."
33,Ummmm didn’t he preach “turning the other cheek”?
34,Or if like.. he had superpowers
35,"And if the Romans had guns, he'd have never walked out of that tomb."
36,He'd probably have done a lot more to those profaning his temple with mercantile pursuits. All he had was a whip and he still went medieval (a couple of hundred years early) on them.
37,"Wait… I saw this on the news a few weeks ago…
Armed Palestinian religious zealot killed by IDF.

My bad, “She” was not armed and was a reporter."
38,"Why hasn't anyone made this movie yet?

The Passion of the Christ 2.  Jesus's Revenge.  Christ Harder."
39,"I'm reminded of James Clavell's Shogun. Two samauri are talking about Jesus. The first one says ""Can't be much of a god if he let himself be crucified"". The second says ""I'd have taken a few heads""."
40,"Jesus resurrected so according to Christians so he's alive anyway. Apart from that, if Jesus had a gun he would have prevented his own crucifiction, never died for anyone's sins and morons like this could not get into heaven."
41,But... Wasn't he resurrected?...
42,Oh I fucking love that.  Genius.
43,If Jesus had a gun then so would’ve Judas and the Romans.
44,"Tbf, i would watch that movie over other Christian movies like Passion Of The Christ aka Jesus snuff film."
45,"""If Jesus had  gun"" 

Motherfucker, he had superpowers. He prolly could have blasted the Romans anytime he wanted to. He let himself be captured and killed."
46,Jesus with a gun would've been so much cooler tho.
47,Isn’t the whole reason he died to save our sins? So that would mean that all of you “good Christians” would go to hell as well
48,"Because, in these people’s minds, single gunmen take on organised militaries with vastly superior resources and DON’T get turned into a sieve."
49,"You'd think one would be better suited to live for thousands of years with omnipotence than a gun, but what do I know."
50,Mate Jesus lived in a time before guns
51,"Then all the christians would be in hell, wouldnt they?"
52,Man can turn water to wine but cant ask his dad for a glock
53,"I think this is a decent place to talk about something I've noticed.

It is the conflict between the (at least on-paper) universality of Christianity (ie; God loves everyone, Christ died for all of humanity, etc... ) and the American exceptionalism and ultranationalism baked into the theology of so many Americans.

You can see it with the depiction of the USA as God's ""Chosen country"", the claims that other countries are ruled by Satan, the utter disregard (sometimes even contempt) about Christians outside the US and other stuff I couldn't think of now.


How do they not see the conflict on at least some level? 


I personally noticed this after some end-times preachers claimed that my country (Turkey) would be destroyed by God. While of course claiming that American Christians would be saved."
54,Praise the Lord and pass the ammo lmao
55,"They literally cannot believe that and also believe their god is omniscient. If God told people this was gonna happen, and then IT DIDNT, then their god ain’t very good at being omniscient as they claim


Of course there’s also the problem that if god was actually omnipotent he wouldn’t need to sacrifice himself to himself to appease himself over the rules he put into place himself"
56,Let he who is without sin pop the first cap.
57,And because he's Jesus he'd never need to reload.  His clip runneth over
58,The Bible reloaded: Jesus isn’t crucifucking around
59,">If Jesus had a gun, he'd still be alive today.

This is how Christians who have no understanding of their own religion identify themselves."
60,This *immediately* made me think of the SNL sketch Djesus Uncrossed with Cristopher Waltz 🤣
61,"well... ive heard rumours that he did spend a lotta time blowing roman soldiers, if ya catch my meaning"
62,"Just imagine it like it was in Thor: Ragnarok.

Skurge is Jesus with them M16s and the undead are the roman soldiers lol"
63,"I would say, judging by their behavior, the answer is a firm no."
64,"it leterally says that in his eternal plan he would die for everyone

also when he was resurected he went back up to heaven lmao

if your gonna be religious at least read the fucking text"
65,Doesn't he literally tell off one of the apostles who tried to go ham with a sword?
66,"I get the sense that very few Christians actually read the bible. For example, take all of the pro-lifers waving around the bible as if it's some kind of pro-life manifesto. 

Welp...the bible contains mass murder, genocide, and god himself commanding his followers to murder men, women, children, infants, to be dashed upon the rocks, and gives instructions to punish non-believers by tearing the fetuses out of pregnant women who don't worship him enough. (Hosea is ""fun."" And you would ~~not~~ believe how many Christians have told me, ""That's not in the bible, you're a liar!"") 

It also contains instructions on how to perform homemade abortions (ordeal of bitter water) if you simply suspect your wife of cheating on you. Basically they gather up some muck and other shit, force the woman to eat/drink it, and then wait to see if they can cause her to become violently ill enough to cause an abortion.

If pro-lifers could read, I imagine they'd be very angry."
67,True Believers don’t read books! They watch the movie version.
68,"Yes, this would be a more accurate portrayal than what the fruitcakes have in their minds: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIeuBPDUzB0"
69,Maybe it was a Mexican guy who could have stopped a home invasion /s
70,"Thirdly: if Jesus had a gun, surely the Romans would have had MORE guns, right?

That would end beautifully."
71,The only guns he had were the ones he used in carpentry.
72,"Ding ding ding



If god says somethings gonna happen, and then it doesn’t, then he’s not omniscient, and they preach that god must be omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolant"
73,"Not to mention not very effective if he's the only one with a gun. Not only does this person lack the imagination to even begin to understand even the goddess of sunshines and puppies could kill you more creatively than a bullet, they also are dumb enough to think one guy with a gun is going to escape his executioners for long."
74,I am almost positive this is a joke. I would put this on my car ironically
75,"*Back in those days you'd*

*Have to go to China just*

*To get a crossbow*

76,Hahaha. Awesome.
77,Pew pew pew!
78,"Say what you will about religious imagery, but this _Metal Slug_ remake really is looking pretty good..."
79,Who do you think the catholics learnt it from
80,"Additionally, Jesus is supposed to be the son of their god and had the ability to perform magic, which means if he really wanted off that cross, he could have easily performed some kind of miracle and left."
81,"Seriously. If you believe in Jesus, you kinda need to know the basics. Does this person even Easter bro?"
82,hard pass
83,"Simon Peter, He struck the priests Eunice and cut off his ear.  Jesus healed the ear and told off Simon Peter for drawing a sword."
84,Nail gun maybe
85,"Me too, I am going to get this printed on a t shirt."
86,"Yeah. For people that claim to believe in divine powers, many of them have little to no imagination.

A gun. So dumb."
87,"All in all Jesus' miracles were kinda shit anyway. Making water into wine, fine, but maybe next time take away hunger or thirst or disease forever. Healing a couple dudes, ok, but maybe next time heal everyone for all time."
88,"""Jesus! You just drove that nail in without even hitting it! That's amazing!""

""Yeah dude, it's called a nail gun.""

""A nail *what?!*""

""It's uh, nevermind. It's a miracle dude. I'm magic. 🙄"""
89,He also could’ve just given himself a gun if he wanted to use one
90,"That's why it's a fantasy novel, no different from asking those in Harry Potter why they don't use their magic to help those in poverty, or use their medicines to cure the sick, or use magic to shield victims of war, etc."
91,"He did resurrect like 2 people and himself, so there’s that too"
92,"But we don't know how long it took to make the wine do we? He could have fermented it from scratch and they just left that part out. 

Checkmate atheists!!"
