1,"So, if I say I can’t make a mistake, therefore I can’t make any mistakes even if it appears so. Interesting."
2,Well that’s convenient.
3,"Aisha not having kids could be due to her reproductive system being damaged. According to the hadiths, prophet had sex with her when she was 9."
4,"The more I see Muslims talking about their prophet, and more specifically *how* they talk about him, the more clear it because that he was exactly the same as all the charismatic cult leaders we see in modern times; he was just more successful because of the time and place"
5,"I'm God's Own Prophet, and He says you gotta give me all your money and I get to fuck your wife. 

Prove me wrong."
6,"This argument is like a circle jerk. 

-> writes the quran 

-> writes he can't make mistakes 

-> eveything written in there can't be a mistake

-> his writing must be true

-> profit?"
7,He can do no wrong 🙇‍♀️
8,"I have written on a coaster I cannot make a mistake in my entire life. 

So I am good."
9,"Yes, because it totally isn't rape and doesn't count as having done a bad thing if you fuck a 9 year old, just so long as you don't get her pregnant. That absolutely makes it all better. It only counts as rape and a bad thing when you get a kid pregnant. Nice loop hole there to make sex with male kids, and females before puberty always ok. Won't get them pregnant, so can't be bad at all, totally. I've had my eyes opened. It makes perfect sense now."
10,"It is a cult. Many Muslims truly believe that Muhammad was perfect. So for them, anything he did was halal. If a Muslim believes otherwise, then he/she is not a true Muslim. Again, I cannot stress enough that Islam is a cult."
11,Haha broke up with my Muslim bf over this
12,In Islamic tradition the Prophet was emphatically a Man. He relayed god's word but he was not god. Even in the Koran he made mistakes which god called him out on.
13,Him being born was the first mistake he made
14,"Well, the Christian church also claimed the same shit for centuries, still doesn't make it so. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infallibility\_of\_the\_Church"
15,That's how you build a megachurch!
16,-> Prophet
