1,"Note the lack of any citations, because I can pretty much guarantee that the amendment says nothing about any of that."
2,"They forgot to add:

- sale of aborted fetuses to supermarkets for roasts and BBQ meat. 

- allow abortion clinics to hand out frequent flyer abortion cards so you get your 10th abortion for free. 

They are just as reasonable and have as much evidence as all the other christlike scare mongering bullshit."
3,Unpopular opinion: Minors absolutely should be allowed to get an abortion without parental consent and should not have to inform them either. Some parents have super messed up priorities and try to force these teenage girls to have the baby as a form of punishment.
4,I feel like all those bullet points are straight-up lies.
5,If you were Catholic it‚Äôs against the Catholic rules they don‚Äôt have an abortion that being said not being a Catholic not being religious not being involved in any kind of really just activity it‚Äôs none of your freaking business with anybody else does that‚Äôs between you and you‚Äôre made up sky daddy good luck to you
6,The church using made up stuff to get what they want? Who can imagine?
7,Just when I had a sorta warm fuzzy for the Catholic Church I was raised in. Went to St. Andrew‚Äôs Cathedral. Never read the magazine when it would show up at the house though. Good riddance.
8,Does it says anything homophobic too?
9,Post this on r/excatholic
10,"What the hell.

People like this are the reason why religion is seen as a joke.
smh"
11,"‚ÄúAllow abortion up until birth‚Äù - sounds fine to me. Some cases this is to prevent death of the mother. Abortion is a medical procedure.

‚ÄúAllow monies to pursue abortions and sterilization without parental notification or consent‚Äù - also completely reasonable. No woman should ever be forced to give birth. For some young women the lack of parental notification could prevent things like honor killings.
 
Rest of the list is made up garbage. Fuck the Catholic Church. Remove tax exempt status for all religions now!"
12,And I'm more than excited to vote yes this November!  I hope it can help make up for a lifetime of listening to and trying to peddle this forced-birther propaganda.
13,"According to Catholicism, everyone has ""inherent dignity"", which means women must be forced to carry dead fetuses until they're seconds away from death"
14,"Oh, it definitely doesn't lol. I'm one of the volunteers who helped gather those signatures.  They are just flat out lying their lying ass off."
15,Right.  One of my favorites is women who have abortions harbor guilt their whole life.
16,I'm in agreement.  I had mine when I was 17. Thankfully my mom signed for me and my dad's private insurance covered it. I told my daughter and son if either ever needed a ride to the clinic my only questions would be what day and time.  If they are 15 and up I'm all for them going without parental consent.
17,https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/Senate/htm/2021-SIB-0732.htm this is the actual proposal.
18,"Um, spoiler. That's because they all are lies."
19,"> ‚ÄúAllow abortion up until birth‚Äù - sounds fine to me. Some cases this is to prevent death of the mother. Abortion is a medical procedure.

Whenever I hear this I ask them to give me an example of a woman who had a third trimester abortion for shits and giggles. They literally cannot understand that a late-term abortion happens because shit has hit the fan and either the baby won't make it or the mother's life is in danger. They just keep listening to the right-wing propaganda about how Democrats are bloodthirsty demons who want to rip as many 8.5 month old fetuses from the womb as possible, as if it's some sort of sport."
20,"Dude, you and me both. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of men I work with who signed my petitions. Made it clear that its only a small fraction of people who are in support of banning abortion."
21,Um say fucking what? So a dead fetus in a woman's womb still deserves dignity? Can you please elaborate?
22,"The catholic church...lying? why, I never. Are you sure?"
23,"I don't know anyone who harbours guilt after having an abortion. But I know many who harbour major guilt and regret at having kids. Despite it still being a social taboo to admit it, people are coming out and saying it openly."
24,"Definitely, I live in a country where abortion is illegal, I was born because of this, two teenagers and a baby, not a good combination.

It could have stopped a whole lot of stress etc etc.
I just wish that this stupid anti-abortion law can be overturned in all countries where it exists."
25,"I've heard shit about people advocating for abortion to want to abort the baby after the birth.

ü§î I wonder if that is a blatant lie?"
26,Hahaha üòÜ.  Right.  Well I did send this article off to the ACLU. Since they are trying to influence voting its time we tax them.
27,"I knew one creep who regretted it as he could have 'kept' the woman. 

Could have said 'stayed with her' and it would have been far less creepy, looking back he threw up more red flags than I noticed at the time."
28,I told my SO that all I felt after mine was relief.
29,Same here.
30,"My ex thought the same thing. As soon as I found out I was pregnant, the first words to come out of his mouth were ""No you can't leave me"". The fuck I couldn't. Packed my bags and high tailed it outta there the next week. Never looked back."
31,That's fucking disturbing.
