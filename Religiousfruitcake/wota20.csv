1,"Scary rhetoric for someone sitting in Congress to be saying. Every time people mock her, I think it lessens how frightening it is that she is in an elected representative."
2,Does she know many people lose their faith *after* reading the Bible critically?
3,"Will this test be for all religions, or does she once again assume only her religion exists?"
4,It took her 4 tries to pass her GED exam
5,"None of the religious people I know will ever argue with me actively.

  


I grew up in junior bible quiz and didn't stop learning once I realized it was all bs."
6,"Ok. How about if you want to become a German citizen, you have to learn Grimm's fairy tales.

It's pretty much the same in terms of education and morals."
7,"Everybody gets thrown out 

Not Theocracy for anyone"
8,"Me: Did you know that God once sent a bear to murder children for making fun of a bald guy?

Antiabortion fundy: Lies!

Me via the Bible: [Elisha and the Two Bears (2 Kings 2:23-25)](https://bible.org/seriespage/4-elisha-and-two-bears-2-kings-223-25)

Antiabortion fundy: User has blocked you"
9,Why on Earth did people vote this obviously mentaly ill woman to Congress?
10,I wanna laugh more. What are some details of this test?
11,"The best part is the test will have nothing to do with the actual text, but the cultural mythology that she and her followers exist in that has very little to do with the bible. A few words picked out of context surrounded by elitism."
12,The cool thing about 'literacy tests' is that the whole thing is a setup to give the tester full discretion over whether you pass or fail so they can decide if you should pass or fail...
13,https://twitter.com/telltaleatheist/status/1554605488544911360?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1555142520551751680%7Ctwgr%5E26d8f2173401affd3b9fd680c02fef3cdcfb0f83%7Ctwcon%5Es3\_&ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fboingboing.net%2F2022%2F08%2F04%2Flauren-boebert-calls-for-laws-to-enforce-biblical-citizenship-training-in-our-schools.html
14,"Conservatives, write down on this piece of paper what you actually stand for...

* ~~supporting law enforcement~~ (okay, wait no... not that)
* ~~family values~~ (oh shit, um... trump cheated on pregnant wife with the porn star and had those two divorces)
* ~~protecting confidential information~~ (ah damnit, ivanka had that private server, trump gave Israeli intelligence information to Russia, and now he stole nuclear security documents. Fuck.)
* ~~the president controls gas prices~~ (what? Prices keep going down? Well the president doesn't even control gas prices)
* ~~protect the children!!!~~ (wait, okay so actually no gun laws to reduce/end school shootings and of course we need to get matt gaetz, trump and these other [800+ convicted republican sex criminals who abuse children (often their own) re-elected...)](https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2018/10/23/1806673/-Republican-Sexual-Predators-Abusers-and-Enablers-Pt-1) 
* ~~personal freedom~~ (well no, you can't buy those condoms. What, you're pregnant? Well no you can't have an abortion actually.)
* ~~Elections are fraudulent and the results are not legitimate~~ (hey, shut the fuck up, our candidate just won a primary.)
* ~~Respect the constitution~~ (oh, so I guess there is actually something in there that says we're not supposed to tear gas/arrest reporters, kidnap people in unmarked rental vans during protests, violate the emoluments clause, mix church and state, obstruct Congress certifying election results and shit like that, so scratch this one too.)
* ~~Okay, okay... Well we can all agree that fundamentalist Christian nationalist mike pence is a great guy.~~ (nah bro, hang mike pence)"
15,"Fuck her. 

Actually, no. I wouldn't fuck her with Trumpy's dick."
16,They're going to end up banning the bible once they start looking through it to make up questions.
17,The first problem is that you need literacy in itself to take a test on any book.
18,"""The First Amendment contains two clauses that prescribe the government's relationship with religion. In the first instance, the Establishment Clause states that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" In the strictest reading, the Establishment Clause proscribes any adoption of an official religion by the federal government. More broadly, the phrase functions as a way of assuring that the federal government will not adopt any stance in favor of or against any religion. However, the Supreme Court has tolerated a certain degree of government involvement in religion. For instance, the Court has allowed government funding to go to private religious schools and prayers to begin certain legislative meetings, as in Town of Greece v. Galloway. In that case, the Court ruled that a town hall meeting that began with prayers, predominantly given by members of different denominations of Christianity, was not a violation of the Establishment Clause, in part because legislative prayers are for the legislators and not for the public.

The second clause of the First Amendment that deals with religion immediately follows the Establishment Clause: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the exercise thereof."" Where the first clause prohibits Congress from adopting any particular religion, the second clause prohibits Congress from interfering with an individual's exercise of religion. This second clause is called the Free Exercise Clause. The Free Exercise Clause protects an individual's right not only to believe what he or she would like but also to practice it. The clause protects individuals from laws that would expressly inhibit them from engaging in religious practices.""

religious people make me nuts."
19,"Jesuit Catholic school here. Bring it on. Atheist and headed to hell, can analyze biblical sources."
20,"Religion-related freedom, but not in that sense."
21,"I’m an American citizen, and I would fail. The Bible is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life."
22,The land of the free!
23,"Is she aware that even Christian sects disagree on what's in ""The Bible"""
24,"Problem is a Christian is making the test. So the ""correct"" answers are wrong."
25,Her version of a literacy test probably doesn't involve much literacy.
26,My three year general bible studies degree was the final nail in the coffin for my faith.
27,"When you read the Bible you're a Christian, when you understand the Bible, you're an atheist."
28,"""Complete the following phrase: Blessed are the...""

""Peacemakers, for they will be called the Sons of God.""

""I'm sorry, we were looking for 'Blessed are the warmongers for theirs is the kingdom of heaven'"""
29,LMAO at assuming they would reference anything from the actual bible in a bible literacy test.
30,Ha!  I’m descended from colonists who came to the US from England in the 1600’s and an atheist and literally don’t know shit about the Bible.  So I guess I need to go back to my country.
31,"It’s not like the test would even be biblically accurate, it would be created from the evangelical interpretation, so the only ones that can pass it would be the ones who have been thoroughly indoctrinated"
32,"Let’s be honest, Lauren Boebert would not pass a bible literacy test."
33,"This is the test:

Who is more Christ-like?

A. Donald J Trump


B. Jesus H Christ"
34,They will change the grading system so no atheist could ever pass
35,Atheist here but grew up son of a pastor lol. I've read the Bible 4 times cover to cover plus all the studying as a youth. I'd pass lol.
36,"I don't think Lauren Boebert should be calling for any sort of literacy test, it just will not end well for her"
37,I’d prefer she understand the constitution more
38,"So no need to honor that first amendment then, huh?"
39,Can Lauren even read??
40,"You first, Lauren."
41,You would think solely based on its physical location they would have stumbled upon the 1st amendment at some point in their rush to talk about the 2nd amendment.
42,Hopefully they get 3-4 chances like she needed for her GED.
43,"The so-called christians would claim test fraud, and that they actually won. Hugely and biggly."
44,"As someone from across the pon, even I can see how un-American that concept is. Its quite literally against what the founding father stated their aims to be."
45,Lol like she could even read and comprehend it
46,"I have no problem people being religious, but these nutters that want a Christian (read: evangelical) Theocracy need piping down. 

Insane"
47,I wouldn't mind it is it was a test about basic constitutional law.. but then again she too would fail at that as well
48,I take it but only if she takes it and passes
49,They’d just rewrite the book again. It hasn’t stopped the wealthy yet
50,"Of course all us atheists are going to fail, because it'll be people like Lauren Boebert that make the fucking test."
51,"then they shift the goalposts, duh"
52,How did this woman get elected? WTF Colorado?
53,"Hey, Boezo,

Here's the wager. We both take a Bible literacy test, and whoever gets the lower score has to leave the country. 

This isn't a joke. Pack your bags, loser."
54,They'll just rewrite the Bible.  It's been like 40 years since the last one.
55,"That's easy. They change the rules to try to fit only themselves, again."
56,"It's Christofascism. They will just say the atheists failed and gas them. 

You cannot ""gotcha"" them. They just want to rule over you to assert their nebulously defined in-group. They can and will change the rules on the fly to suit that purpose."
57,"They're juuuust smart/sinister enough to know this. The test would be about submission to the parts of the bible that support they're bullshit, not any actual knowledge. Of course they'd be dishonest about it.



Q: ""Which bible verse outlaws abortion?""



""Well, the bible never actually cites any case against abortion. In fact, it offers methods for...""




""Wrong! God said it's murder, so the whole book is anti-abortion! Kill the heretic!"""
58,"I've found the people who feverishly defend the Bible, are the ones that have never read one chapter."
59,"""College turns children librull""

\*anger*

""You need bible College to be in a murica""

\*smug*

""NO NOT LIKE THAT""

calling it now tmhoc aug 15th 2022"
60,Nazi Barbie failed her GED three times She is the LAST person who should be demanding any sort of test.
61,"Same thing that happened in the Jim Crow South when former slaves could recite the Constitution by heart, but poor whites could barely spell their names. Limited full citizenship for the ingroup, and lynchings for the outgroups 

The outcomes will remain the same if conservative theocrats control the process."
62,"If you want to stump a Christian, ask them to summarize the book of Obadiah.

None will be able to do it despite the fact that it's the shortest book with a single chapter consisting of only 21 verses .

You can memorize a summary easily and beat them at their own game."
63,Christian nationalism is taking over.  Bow down to your republican overlords america
64,"Plenty of Atheists regard the Bible in the same manner as any other classic literature, and have a decent amount of knowledge on the text. If it were taught in classrooms, that doesn't mean anyone has to believe it. It's certainly not something that's bad to study given the cultural, historical, and thematic significance it has held over centuries. I doubt Atheists would fail a Bible literacy test at a rate that's significanrlt higher than Christians if the test is at a high school level or beyond."
65,"Question 1:

It is easier for a camel to go through the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God

Atheists answer: eye of a needle

Christians answer: U.S. border"
66,"I hear she isn't a great test taker, so this is kind of a bold move."
67,This sounds like a Moral Orel episode
68,How did that asshat get elected?.  I pay taxes which pay teachers and I don’t want schools to indoctrinate my children.  Not religiously or politically.
69,She’s probably the last person to be asking for any kind of a literacy test.
70,"If you need an answer to that then maybe a logic test would be a good idea too, love."
71,How about an IQ test for political offices?
72,"Yep, this is exactly right. The vast majority of Christians have never read the bible, while most atheists have. Reading it and knowing what it actually says is exactly why we are atheists. And that is also exactly why the church did all it could, for as long as it could, to make sure the general public wasn't able or allowed to read to bible on their own. They knew exactly what it meant for people to be able to actually read it and compare it to reality and actual history. Nothing good for them. 

It is just like republicans and the constitution. Not a single one knows what it actually says. They've never bothered to read it. Just a few popular quotes, and what their dear leaders tell them they need to know is enough. Doesn't matter everything they think about it is wrong. I'd be all for this one honestly. Immigrants have to take a test to get citizenship, so I would be all for those of us born in America having to take a test about our history and the constitution before being allowed to vote. It would make sure we have informed voters. Of course, republicans, well they'd die out as a party, as not a single one would ever have any chance of passing that."
73,"Which is exactly what will happen. I’ll try and find it, but Pew Research or one of the polling orgs did a thing on knowledge of biblical and world religions. Not surprising, atheists were right at the very top, along with Jews and Mormons. evangelicals and Catholics were much lower on the list.

*SHOCKER: We know their fairytales better than they do.*"
74,"This isn't about actual literacy, this is just solicitation. She is advocating for her specific religion to be advertised to the youth, paid for by government resources."
75,“They understand the Bible yet still choose to reject it and follow satan. That makes them worse than non-believers. They are a danger to our society and should be killed or jailed.”
76,"This rings with me as a quote I saw basically said when you read the Bible you stop becoming a Christian.  
The hypocrisy is the church is unbelievable and can only be described as being controlled by people who haven't read the Bible. They use particular passages to push non Christian ideals. If you Rea dthe book, got the context you would realize half of the garbage ""christians"" are preaching isn't actually biblical."
77,"Why is Boebert even talking?

I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. (Timothy 2:12)

Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control. (Timothy 2:11-15)

For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. (Corinthians 11:8-9)"
78,"Bible literacy...to become an American citizen?  Just like this post implies, atheists would pass this bs test with flying colors.  90% of these fake christians just let their bibles collect dust.

What about the other cults/religions, Lauren?  For instance, if I study 'Dianetics' by L. Ron Hubbard and prove myself a knowledgeable, devout Scientologist, am I still patriotic enough for ya??"
79,That is why a lot of people reject religion---they actually read the texts.
80,Doesn't this go against the constitution? The first amendment is freedom of religion.
81,Oh shit! I still own a study Bible from high school. I'll crack that bitch open again to prove a point for sure. Some mad good horror stories in there iirc
82,As I recall the founding fathers were huge on the separation of church and state
83,"Politicians are like mega church preachers. I honestly don’t think they truly believe anything they say. It is the path to money and power so they will say whatever gets things going. 

Remember when that guy banished COVID through God?"
84,Lol cute she thinks Boebert and her ilk wouldn’t be writing the test
85,"Thata not a bad idea, get rid of all the crazy bible thumper and keep the sane people."
86,What about freedom of Religion?  Non-Christians may not have read the Bible.  Have you read the Koran? or the Talmud? or the Torah? or the Bhagavata Purana?  or the US Constitution for that matter?  What about separation of church and state?  Let's face it LB is an idiot.
87,"The ""Christians"" will still pass, because the questions will be like:

Jesus would.....

Select the correct answers

1. Defend your gun rights

2. Love the underprivileged people

3. Elect Trump as President

4. Promote equality

5. Love America.

Correct answers: 1, 3, 5"
88,You assume the written test will be on based actual bible radical progressive socialist jewish jesus and not capitalism jesus.
89,I wonder how many televangelists would fail the test.
90,"For someone who claims to love the country, she sure doesn't respect the constitution."
91,Didn't it take her several tries to pass the GED? What happens when it takes her several tries to pass a Christian literacy test? Lol
92,"Boebert:  Obviously they cheated, they need to take the test over again.......and again......and again"
93,Which bible?
94,Freedom of religion whaaat? Shes gonna go crazy when she hears about the supposed separation of church and state… oh wait. She already is
95,As an atheist that has read the Bible cover to cover twice and spoke to many “Christians” this is 100% accurate.
96,"That’s so cute coming from someone who didn’t even have a GED til 6 months ago. Aw.

Edit: I know she had to pass it before being elected."
97,Was going to say I enjoy tormenting uneducated christians but showing them the questionable bits of their myth. I can find the rule about no mixed fibers in Leviticus in seconds. Lots gang bang is a quick one too.
98,"Their ""book club"" sucks. It has the worst, and poorly educated people in it."
99,Every denomination would be up in arms too since there's no way to standardize what is a right/wrong answer if there are any questions that are based on interpretation.
100,Why the bible? There should be a Dune lore test
