2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"I always ask that question. If they believe that life is pre destined then why convict murderers? It was their gods plan and the murderer fulfilled it, why should man punish him?"
2,"Maybe God got the people to save them?  Or you can just sit on your collective religious asses and let people die, whatever.   You are fucking assholes, but hey! Just keep preaching!"
3,"Hey that's my country lmao

Sure was a shock to suddenly see Bulgarian on here tho unfortunately we still have fruitcakes a plenty"
4,"Look, religious people aren't *inherently* stupid, but religion does stifle development of critical thinking skills (especially evangelical religions). This is to say that the religious aren't exactly the best critical thinkers."
5,Wait Bulgaria? I really thought that was one of the areas along with Czechoslovakia and the DDR the Warsaw Pact managed to break the influence of the Church.
6,"Honestly it's kind of... weird because atheism is pretty common but idiots from the orthodox church are free to talk bullshit on tv 

I think most of the religious nonsense is among the older parts of the population so it woudlnt surprise me if the person who wrote this comment is 70+"
