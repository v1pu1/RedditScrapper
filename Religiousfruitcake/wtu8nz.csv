1,The sunlight we use has a creator. It's the Sun.
2,"“You tell me that everything has a Creator, but that creator itself doesn’t have one…? That’s a stupid thing bro”"
3,"Well the moment you can show evidence of stars being created we will listen. For evidence of light fixtures being created, I’m sure there more than one “How it’s Made” episode on the topic…"
4,"We can show you who made the lightbulb, the inventor of it is even well documented with verifiable evidence of his existence. Now, if only they could show us this supposed creator of the universe."
5,"Boom Roasted, Atheists!!!!!!!!!!

6,"You cannot argue with religious people. Everything they say is non-falsifiable, non-empirical, anecdotal bullshit and you will never move them from their fairy tale positions. 

When you reject empiricism your brain has fully rotted."
7,"I don't know who originally coined the question, but Aron Ra once asked; ""Why is it that God can create things we *can't* make, but he can't create the things we *can* make?""

I've yet to meet someone religious who can answer this question."
8,"Creator implies agency, the sun has none. No more so than a fire itself has agency."
9,creators all the way down
10,"http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/starform.htm
Literally has picture evidence and scientific data to show exactly how a stat is created
It’s gravity not god"
11,"I agree fully. I actually brought up falsifiability in my response to this guy, but he's since just ignored all my points, called my logic bad without any justification(rather common of theists, I suppose), then continued to present terribly thought out arguments."
12,"Also, you may or may not have seen it, but the Veritasium video titled ""The Most Common Cognitive Bias"" does a great job demonstrating why attempting to falsify claims is extremely important"
13,"I just need to clarify, based on your wording - you know the sun isn't a fire, right?"
14,"Created implies a creative agent. What you shared supports the formation of stars, not a god creating them."
15,I absolutely do. Just an analogy. I could have gone for a gigantic collection of mostly hydrogen that forms a nuclear fusion reactor. Yeah I know what the sun is ;)
16,"“Created” only implies an intelligent “creative agent” if the audience already believes an intelligent “creative agent” created everything and the idea conveyed is sufficiently vague to allow it. For those of us that don’t believe in intelligent design, it doesn’t have that connotation at all.

For example: “Natural selection created Homo sapiens” or “This iteration of the universe was created by the Big Bang” or “The Grand Canyon was created by erosion” are perfectly understandable, efficient, and complete thoughts, even to an intelligent design proponent.

This is pedantry - an attempt to control an opponent’s ability to convey their ideas efficiently through subjective and disingenuous limitations of “acceptable” language."
17,"OK, just checking.  A lot of faulty arguments are based on the idea that the sun is literally fire."
18,"I really wouldn’t use such language because it has that connotation for a shocking amount of people and leaves you open to “creation needs a creator” bullshit. Creation has implications you don’t believe in so why use that word when better ones exist? I’m not your opponent here. I’m trying to safeguard you from an argument. In the context that I used, it’s perfectly correct to say there is no evidence for the creation of stars… I’ve also never heard any biologist use create the way you did…"
19,Oh I know. It’s just a decent analogy for the point I was trying to make. Bringing in nuclear fusion only confuses matters.
20,"There is no “connotation” as demonstrated by my examples. 

Did you understand my meaning without being able to insert your connotative interpretation? Of course. I didn’t use any linguistic tricks. These were simple Subject-Verb-Object sentences.

There is no connotation - only cognitive bias unrelated to the language."
21,"…. Whatever. It most definitely has such a connotation, that’s what creationists dishonestly exploit. But have a good day."
22,"If a definitional vagueness is dishonestly exploited it’s not connotative - it’s pedantic.

The purpose of argument is to change minds. You can’t do that if you don’t challenge cognitive bias through it’s application to the signal system we use to debate - language. Changing perfectly understandable language to suit your interlocutor doesn’t change their mind - it passively reinforces their bias.

I am sure you were well-intentioned in your attempt to safeguard me though."
