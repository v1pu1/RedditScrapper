1,"They just admitted that god is human made fiction.
Wow indeed."
2,"This seems to be something a vocal atheist would say, completely incongruous being on a church sign."
3,"What happened to ""facts dont care about your feelings""?"
4,"Translation:

With enough money you can do whatever you want. Just look at how many politicians we can influence!"
5,Saying the quiet part out loud again.
6,Wow! Just wow!
7,r/selfawarewolves
8,"Through god all things are possible, so jot that down."
9,"This os so toxic. If you delusion yourself enough, facts and laws don't matter. Because, you must be right if you think you are hard enough. It literally tells people to just go ahead and do whatever you want, if you think it's okay hard enough, it won't matter what happens. A very dangerous mentality."
10,Wednesday is at 7:00
11,"So, get your lies, your red hot lies here!!!!"
12,"Exactly, you self-owning twats."
13,paoli indiana i’m assuming. my grandparents live there.
14,...which is a problem...
15,"Well, yes, if you actually read the bible. The fact is, you’ll sink in water but Jeebus was able to tapdance across that H2O sucker. Then he invites Pete for a quick wander over the side of the Galilean runabout, and Pete says yep, I am up for that. But his faith wasn’t strong enough to defeat the power of gravity and water density and mass and all that uncool sciency stuff, and so he started to sink. And he cried out to his mate Jeebus,”Oi mate, I ‘m bloody sinking here, pull out your finger and chuck us a rope.” And verily was Jeebus disa-bloody-pointed that his bestie didn’t have the faith to not sink in water. And once again physics won the day. From the Gospel of Bazza."
16,Technically true
17,Facts don’t care about your faith
18,"Nah these people think that they are Orks. 
“If I believez that tis ol’ god existz, then he mustz exist!”"
19,"Whose religion is it anyways?

Where everything's made up and the facts don't matter!"
20,"problematic, that's why we had trump, Fox, republiCons, Anti-vaxxers"
21,"Can you imagine thinking that's a good idea to put on a sign?    I mean, what has to be your situation where you're saying ""Oh boy!  I've got so much faith I can ignore reality!""?"
22,"How I read it is that they don't care if their beliefs are true or not. They don't want to hear the truth. They prefer to pretend their imaginary sky daddy is watching over them. It's a lot like believing in Santa Clause and putting your fingers in your ears when someone tells you he is not real.

And this is fine. They can believe whatever they want. I don't care. However, keep it to yourself and stop trying to force it on everyone else. Do you see us out there trying to teach the religious, facts? No. Do we picket churches? No. I will even fight for your right to believe in your imaginary friend. But I expect you to respect my right to non-belief."
23,"There's definitely some truth to this, if someone's faith is big enough they can easily be blinded to facts. Perhaps not what they were going for though."
24,"Faith, meet hard brick wall of reality."
25,I fully agree.
26,God created man allegedly and man created religion
27,"They all know that none of their religions have any proof of their wild claims.  They know it's fictional.  They are *choosing* to reject all reality and accept total fiction as reality. 

That's why religion is a sign that the person is disconnected from reality.  They can look at a fact and just discard it, while pretending it never existed, never had any significance.  That's important because it affects you.  You can't reason with someone that ignores reality and facts.  On anything.  Ever."
28,You’d be surprised by the thing religious people can say with a strait
29,Easier to spot the crazies now
30,A lot of religions.
31,Good Christian men have heavily calloused knees.
32,A lot of gods too
33,"But remember, only one of them is the ""right"" one to follow."
