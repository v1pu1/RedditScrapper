1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"When i was a muslim, this was hilarious. Now, even more so."
2,What tide?
3,"Every time I hear a Muslim ‚Äúevangelize‚Äù, it always makes 0 sense. Lots of words, nothing to say. I guess you could call that an ‚Äúunstoppable tide‚Äù. The Arabic world has fallen far since the days of it pushing the boundaries of math and science. Seems like that fall coincides with the rise of Islam ü§∑"
4,"If atheist arguments are baseless, then what are islamic arguments even? Believing, just like any other religion, to be the true religion, because some dude said he was the messenger of sky daddy, essentially a rip-off Jesus. A future dominated by religion isn't a bright one for the free world, just like any ideology of this category.

""GOD IS REAL!!!""
So prove it, to which the only response is ""No, he is real! Prove he doesn't exist!""

So thankfully it isn't an unstoppable tide as ite fairy tales cannot compete with logic"
5,The closet shows that muslims have even more baseless arguments
6,![gif](giphy|xUA7aM09ByyR1w5YWc)
7,"This subs for making fun of you, not for you to be a fruitcake.

There is r/antitheistcheesecake , a sub readily available for people like you."
8,why is that ... meme so wrongly applied?
9,"I see an empty shelf, still waiting for any good evidence a god of any sort exists."
10,If Islam or Evangelical Christians truly are an unstoppable tide it doesn't mean they're correct. It just means the world is fucked and a new dark age of fascism is coming.
11,"I know this post was created to antagonise people and all, but let's say you convinced me to leave Hellenism and convert to Islam. Then what?

You still would treat me as a piece of trash because I wasn't born from Muslim and I have no connections whatsoever to any of Arabic clans. Then here's question, why are you brigading if you won't achive anything?"
12,Why his? Are there no female atheists? Use they.
13,Out of all religions islam probably has the dumbest arguments based upon to follow lmao. Left that crap soon as I matured.
14,The only tide that matters is the tide of apostacy in Muslim countries
15,"...Oh, wait, you *unironically believe this?* Wrong sub, mate. Nobody's buying what you're selling."
16,Based meme lol
17,Same bro
18,Sure buddy.
19,"The rising tide of religious nationalism in the world. In some places it's evangelicals, in some it's Islam.

Hopefully it can be curbed and it's definitely not a good thing."
20,"Your logic is that the Islamic golden age had nothing to do with Islam,but the situation of current Muslim countries is 100% because of Islam. That just doesn't make any sense."
21,ü§ì
22,ü§ì
23,Still this sub is a gold mine for based memes
24,Then you're blind.
25,Not everything you don't like is Fascism.
26,I'm not even Arabic.
27,"Oh no,How could I be so mean."
28,Yeah this shit is funny
29,Fr
30,"It doesn‚Äôt? Islam seems to restrict science just as much as Christianity. And you certainly can‚Äôt say Islamic nations are scientifically thriving. 

Christians like to say that it was Christianity pushing the enlightenment, but that was blatantly false. One thing I‚Äôve noticed about you theists is that you all like to engage your biases with your own religion, but point out the flaws in a different religion when they use the exact same argument. I don‚Äôt know Islam that well (why should I, in all of your ‚Äúunstoppable tide‚Äù you have yet to provide evidence lol), but I think your biases are doing the talking here."
31,Neckbeard things
32,"""Look at the trees"" is not evidence, it's you simply not understanding trees."
33,"That is true, but also irrelevant. I never said everything I don't like is fascism.

For example, people who try to make a strawman out of things they disagree with by responding with something irrelevant aren't necessarily fascists."
34,So from which country are you out of curiosity?
35,You aren't mean. Most women are simply nothing but sex slaves in the eyes of momo and his followers. Nothing suprising.
36,You can't blame Islam for everything wrong with some countries.
37,"Says the brigaders, lol"
38,Bosnia.
39,"And I never did, lol. There are some Christian countries thriving, and Christianity is just as bad. If you‚Äôll take the time to read what I wrote, you‚Äôll see I said that Islam restricts scientific growth. That‚Äôs all. I have no idea why the ME is behind Europe in terms of democratic and technological progress, it‚Äôs probably very complicated."
40,"Bruh, are you being sarcastic? This is religiousfruitcake"
41,"Bruh, I can see your post history. You‚Äôre a Muslim troll brigading this sub. You‚Äôre a fruitcake, just like OP"
42,After all of the cross posts this sub make???
