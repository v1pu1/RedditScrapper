1,This is inaccurate.  No self-respecting cat would lower themselves to being lesser than a god.
2,"Sure cat's can be Christian, but we all know they choose to follow the Dark Lord out of respect for his craft."
3,"So let me just point out some questions I do have with this. I have looked over some of it and yeah the cat doesn't talk but it speaks in thought bubbles.

But it's still anthropomorphizing the cat by giving it a religious belief made for humans. I do also just wonder if the cat understands that according to its religion it doesn't have a soul.

I know books have been banned for having talking animals because it goes against Christian beliefs which is probably why they made sure it talks in a thought bubble to make it clear it doesn't actually talk."
4,The cat is near the rainbow. Is it going to turn the cat gay?
5,But pets don't go to heaven.
6,Awe come on man this isn’t even that nutty it’s a cartoon cat let them have their fun
7,"They really stole the name of a main protagonist of “Kitty Clussy”.

I hate life."
8,"When your whole belief system is made up, you get to go anywhere you want with it."
9,Right? We all know they are 5th dimensional eldritch beings.
10,Already has.
11,"That's what the church told us in grade school. Talk about some downers.

My dog was an Norwegian Elkhound so I like to imagine he'd be in Valhalla or Folkvangr if it were real."
12,"The pastor of my childhood told us that animals went to heaven because they did not commit sin. When a cat kills a bird, it acts as God intended it to be, so it is not a sin.
He also said that homosexuals are created by God, like everyone else. I really liked catechism with him!"
