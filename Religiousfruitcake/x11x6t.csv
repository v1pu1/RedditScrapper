1,"I never understood the ""jesus on the cross"" image.  I thought the important part was that he got off of it..."
2,Is Jesus hanging dong or is it just the shitty resolution?
3,![gif](giphy|D878w4pb4LzMI)
4,Star goat ftw
5,"It's a torture tool some dude died on! If he was stabbed to death, would Christians worship knives?"
6,There's so much to unpack in this post that you'd have to try hard to convince me it didn't just move into a new apartment.
7,I love arguing with christians so dumb they dont even remember that he was jewish
8,Hey guys! Let's use a torture method as a symbol for our religion!
9,we live in a society
10,"Shit I kinda like the crucifix, I collect them lol"
11,Just a thought. Maybe it's what the image represents to some people not the image itself?
12,Plus the goat and Star looks bad ass no matter context dead martyr dude not so much
13,I subbed to look at insane religious people not boomer level memes shitting on people's faith
14,Lowkey r/im14andthisisdeep material
15,Poor jesus lol
16,"I've always liked the idea of Jesus coming back and just being really annoyed that *that* was the symbol they chose. Like, what part of the stpry makes them think that he likes crosses. It was a horrible situation. He *died*. And these people put that symbol (sometimes with his corpse still attached) all over the place."
17,If we don't sin Jesus died for nothing
18,This is just a stupid argument my guy
19,"Pretty sure the focus is He suffered for our sins. The magic trick proved he was magic, but the Suffering is what we are supposed to have endured and will not because he made his sacrifice. That's the takeaway I always got."
20,"Imagine if the whole deal actually happened, I don't think Jesus would want to come back here when he sees people still wearing him on the cross 2000 years later, lol. Dude must be traumatized"
21,Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s to represent his sacrifice
22,"""Let's worship this dude for getting off."" honestly sounds like something I'd do."
23,"Christians keep changing their minds about what it all means.

That's one of the reasons why I left. If the Holy Spiritâ„¢ was real, it would have lead Christians to all have the same consistent interpretations."
24,Oh he hangs dong. Only reason I bought tickets
25,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
26,"If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten"
27,Thats what Im sayin though ðŸ¤£
28,"I mean, many see the Lance of Longinus as a holy relic, so it tracks..."
29,"He was stabbed. On the cross. With a spear. That spear is now a magical artifact. Some occultists believe Hitler found it, but that the spear was cursed so that whoever holds it will win their wars, but if they drop it they lose utterly."
30,But it is programming right ? If the roles was inverted everyone would demonize the cross.
31,"And what does the second image represent? A man tortured to death. Sure, he got better but that's not what Christianity focuses on all that much in it's symbolism.
I get why that is (so you never forget the sacrifice and feel guilty at everything you do that's not pious because you failed to live up to an impossible standard) but on some level you have to admit that every Christian has a depiction of a crucified corpse on their person or in their home. It's pretty weird if you look at it without Christian preconceptions."
32,It's not shitting on faith.
33,"Itâ€™s not an argument per se, itâ€™s an observation"
34,Genuine question. So why are there people today that still have suffered more than crucifixion? Or are suffering worse as we speak. Do they have an explanation as to why?
35,His sacrifice for us was giving up a weekend.
36,Im still suffering so we need to nail him to another cross
37,Yet we will suffer in hell if we donâ€™t worship him. So Jesus sacrificed himself to himself to save us from his eternal punishment that he will still inflict upon us.
38,Which was nullified after 3 days
39,Like that discount I gave ya'?
40,No man left behind!
41,"So if he was bludgeoned to death with, say, a chicken, they'd be worshipping the bones of that chicken?"
42,">Sure, he got better

Please, tell me I'm not the only idiot that thought of the ""she turned me into a newt"" scene of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, lol.

![gif](giphy|mpxQs0MCqWJKo)

Like:

Jesus: They tortured me to death!

The Apostles: to death?

Jesus: well, I got better..."
43,"Well my observation is that itâ€™s not the symbols themselves but what they represent.

I mean we see a snake going around a stick and assume thatâ€™s something to do with health?

Cross person died for sins. Yeah good symbolism, for anyone else itâ€™s just a man on a cross. Same thing with the satan symbol.

I called it stupid because the comparison is being made with the same group of people."
44,"He takes away the sin of mankind, it is believed that when the humans faced away from god several times that they loaded sin upon themselves and future generations (especially the Adam and Eve thing), and with his death he takes away this sin because he sacrifices himself and pays the price instead of ""us"". So basically he makes the way free for heaven and repairs the once broken bands with god. 

So they never claimed what you asked, at least the vanilla christian Catholic church not, I don't know about the others."
45,"Furthermore they kind of believe that God is allowing evil to be, because he wants us to have a free will and a choice. Which is kinda funny considering the whackos who don't even understand their own religion but are trying to tell you ll be damned for not following their god."
46,"mind of god, mysterious ways blah blah"
47,"It's religion, it isn't supposed to make sense with reality. It's just supposed to make them feel good about themselves and give them an excuse to act like assholes because they've been ""forgiven""."
48,"Exactly. They are kids getting explosives implanted inside them in Syria. And we're taught that crucifixion is the worst form of torture and way of death ever. I thought this as a kid. I even asked a pastor and he just mumbled and tried to walk away from me as fast as he could to avoid the question. 

Christianity is a meme. Man made religion to control masses. Part of the trap."
49,"[Arise, chicken.](https://youtu.be/zZ9dtZ8lYww?t=41)"
50,Literally what I had in mind writing that lol
51,"My god, how can you not see how much a meme Christianity is. They are so many plot holes and contradictions in the Bible. Nothing about the religion is consistently logical. He didn't die for anyone sins. They is still war, murder etc still going on in the world after this event. Even in the midst of it. He simply got crucified and missed out on a weekend. Nothing else"
52,Vanilla ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£top man
53,ðŸ¤£
54,Man I hate this world lol
55,Agreed
56,Dying for sins doesnâ€™t mean people wonâ€™t sin anymore. Ofc thereâ€™s a shit ton of hypocrisy in the bible. Just donâ€™t go arguing about something youâ€™re wrong about
57,I mean Christianity is like a rabbit hole and there are different routes and the Catholic one is one of the most known routes so I called it vanilla.
58,Yeah no I understand in relation to Minecraft LOL just made me laugh
