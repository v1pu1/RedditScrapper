1,"To be fair, if God did exist, I'd hate him for unjust actions and a lack of communication"
2,Nope we love the separation of church and state!
3,"No, dear.  They hate *you*."
4,"MTG has more shining white fake teeth than brain cells.
She doesn't like being attacked by the left - *attacks the left"
5,America would be so much better if they left religion out of politics.
6,I hate the idea of the Christian god. That guy is a dick.
7,"Yknow it‚Äôs funny; I hate her and everything politicians and braintrusts like her stand for

Yet the difference between us is I still want her to be able to live and thrive in a society that works to better each other, and provides basic and advanced needs and protections and healthcare  for its citizens, whereas she would celebrate me dropping dead tomorrow if she knew me"
8,"All those words, and yet only two things she said are true: 

""I'm a proud Christian Nationalist."" 

And

""They hate us."""
9,"We hate Nazis. You're a Nazi. We hate you for being a Nazi. Your supporters are Nazis. We hate them for being Nazis. If you all renounced Nazis, we wouldn't hate you. You won't, because you're all Nazis, so we hate you. We only hate the Americans who are Nazis. If you want us to stop hating you, stop being Nazis."
10,The writers of The Boys would reject this dialogue in the show satirizing right wing political rhetoric for being too on the nose. Marjorie is well and truly a fascist.
11,"Well, their god wouldn't be the first fictional character I've hated.  He's right up there with Umbridge."
12,"She is literally too dumb to know or understand the links between the phrase ""Christian Nationalism"" and ""Nazi"".

Where do they find these freaks?"
13,"We do hate you yes.
We dont hate God, we just acknowledge he might not be there.
And i love america, i just hate you and your squad"
14,How the fuck am I going to attack and dethrone God if he doesn't exist.
15,"No, no Marjorie. We just hate you."
16,"She claims that the left hates America, but she was the one saying that she doesn't care about the 1st Amendment of the constitution by having no separation of church and state, and trying to force her religion on others. 


> ""**Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion**, *or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.*"" - The First Amendment



Also, it's possible to hate someone that doesn't exist. A person can hate a character in a book or movie or tv show, for example. They can hate what a character represents if they are cruel and harmful toward others, even if it's just a story and they aren't real."
17,"You can hate the concept of something. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Christian nationalist‚Äù what an interesting way to say the most interesting things about you, you were born into."
18,"It‚Äôs true, I do hate her and her ilk."
19,"I don‚Äôt hate God. I don‚Äôt believe in any god or gods. I don‚Äôt even hate religious people. My parents are Christians and I love them to death. I do hate Christian Nationalism and forcing religion onto others, however."
20,She‚Äôs Ku Klux Karen.
21,Who wrote that last line for Marge? She's not that erudite.
22,"No, you are Nazi POS Marjorie Typhoid Gangrene"
23,"Afaik the very constitution this kind of people simply *loves* to quote pretty clearly marks the US as a secular democracy, where things like religious beliefs are left to individual concience.

Why then do they insist to much in treating it non-stop like a christian theocracy?"
24,"-they hate America

I don't, which is why I don't want it's people governed by lunatics 

-they hate God

Why would I spend time hating something I don't even think is real.

-they hate us

Yes, but not for any of the reasons you think I do"
25,Hate =/= pity
26,"I mean if people want to hate God that‚Äôs their constitutional right, that‚Äôs their freedom of religion. She‚Äôs so stupid."
27,People like this used to be put in stocks and humiliated back in the day.  We should go back to that.
28,Two out of three is pretty good for her.
29,"Look, We don‚Äôt call you a nazi because your a religious extremist who believes in the superiority of your race and specifically race and nationality not to mention you hating many marginalised groups like the LGBT, jewish and Islamic religious followers and socialists 

Oh wait, we do"
30,"Did Nazis not also claim to love their country and their god? It was who they hated we condemn them for.

You? Same, same."
31,"MTG is famous for hating Ilhan Omar, mostly because she worships God as a Muslim.  

So which is it Margie? You hate the left because they are godless or is that you just hate people that aren't just like you?"
32,Who the hell voted for this blithering idiot?
33,"No, Marge, they hate you because you're a sky-daddy loving hag disguised as a woman in Congress"
34,"We certainly hate you ,  reptile toes"
35,Yeah lets kill god! Yeah!
36,If God really says and condones all the shit they say he does then yeah I hate that mfer
37,Explain the high amounts of swastikas at republican based events then
38,"Well, I kinda do a little yeah ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
39,"To be fair, that last sentence is true for me."
40,Saying all the right things to the flock. They trigger easily.
41,"Nope, just you."
42,"You figured us out, we hate Nazis."
43,"No, it's pretty much just her I hate.

And Ted Cruz"
44,She is right one one count.
45,"‚ÄúThey hate America, they hate god and they hate us‚Äù 
I mean, she‚Äôs not wrong lmfao. But that‚Äôs not the reason why we hate those things."
46,"""they call me a nationalist (but in German) because I said I'm a proud nationalist!"""
47,Oh is it VictimDay again so soon?
48,"If she were a proud Muslim nationalist, or scientologist and was promoting the country become a Muslim or scientologist theocracy, I doubt this would have gone over well at all. This woman is so fucking dumb. Her brain mass is as shallow as Lake Meade."
49,Well she got 2 out of 3 right
50,"I don't hate America, I don't hate God, but I sure as fuck hate MTG."
51,"Homelander isn‚Äôt real, but I hate him nonetheless."
52,"I wish Majorly Traitor Greed didn't exist, but here I am hating her because she does."
53,The key word to take away from her tweet was 'my God'. That tells me all I need to know.
54,"No she's absolutely right, I do hate God, I do hate America, and I do hate the right.

I would just abandon ship, but unfortunately, although its not the ""best"" country in the world, the US is the most powerful country in the world. Everything we do affects and sets an example for the rest of the world. 

For better or worse, the state of this country will affect the fate of the entire planet.

So we need to fix this shit and stop letting these bible bashing neanderthals dictate other people's rights. 

You're 100% free to practice your religious freedoms. That in itself doesn't harm anyone. The other religions seem to do it with relative ease. 

But these Christians are ruining the country by making church and state the same, when we've known for centuries that such a thing is a totalitarian regime waiting to happen. 

Its happened before and again we're going to have to stop them, with force if necessary.

 If they pass ridiculous laws stripping us of our rights then we'll just have to rebel. No way out of that. But that's a worst case scenario, I suppose.

Look at any country where church and state are the same, like those Eastern Muslim countries, and you see some kind of hell on earth. We cannot allow that to happen in the US. Regardless of who tries, Christians, Muslims, Scientologists. This country must remain religiously neutral."
55,"True he does not exist at all also this woman is a crazy religious nut smh

Hail Satan!"
56,"Not far off, I hate the version of America where you and your kind hold power, I hate your version of god - which makes no damn sense, and I do hate y‚Äôall - all true"
57,She‚Äôs nearly right on one count. She is not loved so depending on who the ‚Äúus‚Äù is‚Ä¶.
58,I fucking hate being remember how realistic of a show the boys were
59,"Reap what ye sow, fascist bitch."
60,Spoken like a true fascist.
61,"Anyone who spent even just one day as part of humanity, should see how inherently human the invention of a ‚Äògod‚Äô is. It encapsulates every fear and lack of explanation that we, as humans, struggle with. If you apply any logic, that has to be the obvious conclusion imo."
62,"No Marge, we just hate you."
63,Oldest trick in the book. Equate yourself with God and then declare political opponents to be the devil.
64,This is the woman who made anti semitic comments?
65,She's not a religious fruitcake. She's a gun crazy nut with nothing but hate in her.
66,Fascism has come to America. And what do you know! It's wrapped itself in a flag and it carries a cross.
67,"Now,  - let us analyze that statement. 

1).  No.  Because,  I love America,  - actually. 

2). No. Because, - god does not exist. So, why whould I waste my time hating a non-existent diety ? 

3). Hate ""Them"" ??? 

 Well, -  I must say that they do make it rather difficult to love them, - right ?"
68,"Well, I just gotta say to the very last bit: it's hard to shake hands with someone holding a gun aimed at me."
69,"A true patriot calls out problems with their country because they want their country to be great. 

A nationalist just puts on horse blinders and pretends their country is great."
70,"‚ÄúGodless left‚Äù

Oh no, it‚Äôs almost like there is supposed to be a separation between church and state!"
71,"Bestie I don't hate god, I hate you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
72,"I mean, I hate Marie from breaking bad and Professor Umbridge from Harry Potter and they don't exist"
73,"They're calling you a nazi because you want to take other people's rights away and then you have the gall to cry about it when people aren't particularly happy with you about that.

I can't stand people who spend all their time demonizing LGBT people, calling us ""groomers"" and saying we shouldn't have rights, then start whining and crying when we're mean to them on the internet. Like we're supposed to worship you and kiss your feet when you're telling us we're evil just for existing? Like you're so above us that you deserve more rights than us? We shouldn't be protected from discrimination but you should be protected from mean comments on twitter? Go fuck yourself, bitch."
74,"I think people are missing the biggest red flag here. She clearly states she is a Christian NATIONALIST. This alone should tell you she's a very dangerous individual who wants to tear down the separation of Church and State. It's not that she believes in wacky stuff, but she literally wants a theocracy."
75,"Imma say it.

I actually hate god, even though I am an atheist.

Just like I hate this bitch

![gif](giphy|4X4WQnrDdOcOk)"
76, So what‚Äôs your problem
77,One out of three isn‚Äôt bad.
78,"Go back to licking peach tree dishes, Margery."
79,"Nope, just you."
80,"Oh yes. We hate America because, we don't want restricted freedom in a ""holy"" dictatorship."
81,"As a member of the godless left, you're damn right I'll attack people who proclaim themselves Christian nationalists!"
82,MTG is a Nat-C
83,November cant come quick enough
84,Bitch be crazy
85,"In her extremely tepid defense, I do not have positive feelings towards any of those things."
86,This title tipped its fedora to me and I feel dirty
87,"‚ÄúWhy do you hate God?‚Äù

‚ÄúBECAUSE HE TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!‚Äù

- God‚Äôs Not Dead (aka what every Christian thinks an atheist is like)"
88,There are a lot of fictional characters I hate.
89,We hate MTG because she is a treasonous snake who is actively ruining America.
90,"No, we just hate you and everything you stand for."
91,I hate anything & anybody the deplorable MTG believes in
92,"Christian nationalist? Call a spade a spade, theocratic dominionist."
93,Agreed on all accounts.
94,Because institutionalized religion =/= personal religion.
95,Rebuked from the monotheistic left.
96,"I think I‚Äôm supposed to be offended by this, but it all looks correct to me"
97,‚ÄúUs‚Äù yep sounds like a nationalist
98,"Every time someone says ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of gods plan‚Äù it sounds like Dutch from RDR2 with ‚ÄúI have a plan, trust the plan‚Äù, so yeah, I don‚Äôt trust gods plan"
99,"Thiests think that we believe there is a god but we deny him. They don't seem to comprehend that we are gullible enough to believe without evidence. For us to understand them we need to understand what they think and what they think we think, and vice versa. Unfortunately they just want to debate a point that has no evidence and we should just drop everything and agree"
100,"1.) Correlation does not equal causation

2.) Mutually *exclusive* ideas, by their very nature, are not the same 

3.) extrapolation of new ideas from the aforementioned *(1. & 2.)* is a dialectic commonly referred to as a *""strawman""*  and is therefore a logical fallacy 

4.) accepting your premise is a prerequisite placing undue conditions on any further dialogue *(we call this ""begging the question"")*

Bless your heart, no one hates America honey, no one hates your diety either, and as for the *""us""* you mentioned, you can bes' believe we do hate that darlin..."
