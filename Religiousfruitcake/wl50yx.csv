1,"They never understand that the argument of ""what started the big bang then?"" Can easily be turned around on them, ""where did God come from then?"""
2,"Something can't be created from nothing.

What?  No, that doesn't count for my god of course!"
3,"Science doesn't know everything.

Religion doesn't know anything."
4,"There are 2 types of humans: people who can admit when they don’t know something, and people with the mind of a child who find it easier to make up absurd stories about things they don’t understand"
5,"The big bang was not a dot of nothing.  It was the entirety of space compressed to a point, as far as we are aware.  It would be more accurate to call it a dot of everything.

As for the where, it was the entire known universe.

When? About 14 bya.

Where did it come from? We don't know.  There's no shame in not knowing.

How did life come from rocks? Well, it didn't  Unless you're talking about minerals and metabolisms, and in that case, the same way it does now.  Organic molecules (those being molecules containing carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen atoms) will form naturally on their own in nature. This has been demonstrated by sample analysis of extra-planetary objects.  In certain conditions, these molecules can come together to form more complex molecules, including nucleotides.  I'm not 100% on it off the top of my head but I believe RNA has been synthesized from such basic molecules without biological aid in a lab setting, although I could be misremembering.  Regardless, once RNA had formed, there now exists a molecule that is able to copy itself, and from there evolution may begin.  Those molecules best at copying themselves made more copies of themselves, eventually developing more and more complex reproduction strategies.

Why doesn't it happen now? It might and we might just not notice.  More likely though is just that modern life has a major head start and eats any new contenders. Or it could be a one time event because it needed just the right conditions.  We don't know.

God's existence has not been demonstrated.

God's ability to create reality has not been demonstrated.

God's timelessness, spacelessness, and nature outside of reality has not been demonstrated, or properly defined.

God stopping earth has not been demonstrated.

You do not adequately understand science, and it is very obvious."
6,"""where was the dot of nothing, when was the dot of nothing""

This Is so funny to me because the big bang was when all space and time started. Saying ""where was something?"" when the word 'where' wouldn't even make sense since there was not even space to have something be somewhere yet. Same with time, saying ""when was something?"" when time wasn't even a thing doesn't make any sense either.

No space = no 'where'

No time = no 'when'

These people don't even know how dumb they sound."
7,"Creation logic "" now im going to introduce this geniie that will take care of absolutely all of the explination as a distraction to my laziness"""
8,So did god make the other planets? Why doesn't the bible describe how they were made in detail?
9,If the earth stopped everything not nailed down would go flying including the people.
10,"If there are two system and one says ""I have the answers to every single thing"" and the other says ""I have tests and theories, and data that supports some of those theories, but there are strict rules for how I accept results, I don't know everything"" You'd be a fool to trust the one that says they know it all just because it's claiming more knowledge."
11,"Both the Big Bang and the rocks that created life came from beyond time, space, and matter.

This answer should be satisfactory to any creationist."
12,Logic and critical thinking have no place in a creationists life. Some of them believe the earth is flat despite all the evidence that it's a globe. You can't educate people who don't want to learn and live in the real world. They love their fantasy one better.
13,"Lazy people despise complexity as much as they despise effort. 

And few things are more contemptuous than asking “questions” designed to…stop questions being asked. 

It never ceases to amaze me that the most bad-faith arguments come from the “faithful”."
14,Ask them who created God and see if they see the comparison
15,"Creationists are dumb because being a Christian and believing in evolution are in no way mutually exclusive. Like when I used to believe in god I kinda just assumed that the story of creation was a metaphor and he created the universe/life through things like the Big Bang, evolution, etc,"
16,"Something can’t come from nothing. 

Where did god come from? Um… he always existed. (i.e from nothing) 

Therefore, something *can* come from nothing."
17,Soup ≠ Rocks stupid
18,"It's more like we don't have enough data or information to make reasonable assumptions on where the primordial atom was when it began expanding, that's outside of humanity's current knowledge, a creator may or masy not have been present, nobody can determine that

And life wasn't from rocks, it was from complicated biological processes we are trying to learn, leading theory being abiogenesis coupled with a few other occurrences"
19,"Using the logic of the fruitcake I might ask, “where did this god come from”?"
20,"Okay, so what was before God? Where did they come from? And what was before before God? 

These questions got me kicked out of Sunday school. Y'all can't explain that far back anymore than science can explain before the big bang."
21,"Here's an even crazier twist. It is more feasible, mathematically speaking, that we aren't even really alive. But this is entirely a simulation."
22,I like the post where gahd farted his own self out.
23,Arguing with cretins is how you become cretinous.
24,Creation realists...lmao
25,"If someone is asking these questions on Reddit rather than look up the different theories of the big bang, and what came before, if anything, on science sites on the internet, then they are just looking to validate their unscientific viewpoints by having unqualified people answer them and pointing out their ""errors""."
26,When did the earth stop rotating?
27,The best part for me is that the big bang theory was formulated by a Catholic priest.
28,"I always remember an episode of Star Trek where Data says ""The first question of science is, I do not know"".

Science is very rarely settled, there are always more questions and answers and sometimes those answers can supercede previous theories.  Science is flexible, new ideas and theories can take us in all sorts of directions, sometimes even backwards.  But we learn from those mistakes and move forward with better information and understanding.

Religion is fixed, rigid and inflexible.  It is closed or very very slow to change on any and all ideas that might contradict what was previously written."
29,"Believing in religion is a bit silly, but doesn't make you stupid. We can't prove there is no god, only that a god isn't needed in any way. But being a religious literalist, that IS stupid. And the worst possible position you can take. Because it means that if one single thing in your holy book can be proven to be wrong, the entire thing then must be discarded out right. And well, bad news for the abrahamic religions literalists, the number of provable mistakes and false things in your books, is near the same as the number of words in them."
30,"Checkmate, atheists!

Welp, I guess I'm no longer atheist."
31,*The Day the Earth Stood Still* was a movie.
32,I don't know therefore I know and it's God and don't you dare ask where God came from or who created him
33,"Why would God need to stop the Earth for a day? Also... Life from rocks? I've not heard this theory before, anyone have any credible links for that?"
34,">beyond time, space, and matter

Hey, there's an answer! It's possible to big bang started there."
35,"ahhh yes, the ol' *""prove to me with empirical evidence, but don't prove me wrong with empirical evidence""* bit... 

I hear ya dog, with you're *ex nihilo, nihilo fit* **but...** but you can't dish it out bruh, iffin' ya can't take it..."
36,The first part of this is dangerously close to science talk… almost like they actually are asking the questions we all are and are working towards answering without taking the lazy way out.
37,"""where is the explanation!!??""

""right here.""

""IM NOT READING THAT!!!"""
38,"O God. The whole thing with life came from rocks! Christ Almighty! No one is saying that except for creationists! 

There wasn't a dot of nothing! These people simply do not understand fundamental science in a way that can be applicable to their beliefs!"
39,"I love that they call science a ""rocks producing life fantasy"" when they literally believe mankind formed directly out of dust and magic."
40,"My favorite part of dealing with creationist bullshit is that they are just wrong. Scientists have centuries of research. They have one questionably sourced book. There is absolutely no physical evidence of their theory while evolution has a mountain of it, hell we have traced the phylogenies down to bacterias. They think that creationism means literally anything but it doesnt because it is just.. not relevant to any discussion worth having"
41,"Living in ignorance and superstition is a lifestyle, apparently. 

For example, it's actually a criminal offense here in Swaziland to accuse someone of witchcraft without ""proof"". Most people truly believe in magic, witches, hexes, curses, and demons. Sometimes people are killed for body parts to use in magic spells and potions, male albino children are the most useful in that regard. Funny thing is almost everyone is Christian. 

Does your pastor raise someone from the dead every Sunday?  If not you should come here, there are a few self-styled prophets who do that regularly.  One even has God's cell phone number and calls him during services to directly ask him for favors for parishioners who can afford it.

Your beliefs are just as nonsensical, but you're incapable of seeing that. Willful ignorance is powerful stuff."

43,"God dammit I really can't tell whether shit like this is genuine or satire.       
It looks exactly the same as satire would."
44,"Bam! You’re preggo!

Much better explanation ty."
45,"Where did god come from, how did god get created, why doesn't god make a 2nd earth for us?"
46,![gif](giphy|3o84U6421OOWegpQhq|downsized)
47,The fuck?
48,"Life can only come from very small rocks, sir."
49,"""creationist realists""
Oxymoron lesson of the day."
50,"Or maybe that of the start of the universe is a meaningless question. The fact that things have “beginnings” and “ends” can easily be just a human projection, because we want everything to agree with our limited local reality. Not everything needs a beginning. And the past century of physics thought us that reality is way more counterintuitive than we think. You’re used to dichotomies and non-contradiction? Well, particles can exist in multiple states at the same time. You think the flow of time is universal to all observers? …Nope. 

In general, it’s not a good idea to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) over poorly formulated questions and dogma-filled beliefs. Religious discourse is grounded in ambiguous semantics and, by definition, does not build on rationality. This is not necessarily a bad thing (rationality is not everything), but arguing against dogma is a complete waste of time."
51,In the year 2253 John Jarha creates an experiment in a newly recontinued Collider. It  literally creates the big bang.
52,"Atheists just remove the middleman.

Science: Whence the universe? We don’t know but we’re working on it.

Religion: God did it! Whence God? We don’t know and don’t care."
53,"“Well obviously we don’t know everything. Based on available evidence we make a best guess-“

“You don’t know? That means it was the Christian god without question.”"
54,I might not know what created the universe but I know d*mn well it wasn’t someone’s imaginary friend
55,This is the first I've heard that God stopped the earth's rotation for a day.  Why?
56,"Theist here. Stop making us look bad, please ."
57,Your willful ignorance or inability to understand science does not denote a lack of explanation by science. Almost everyone I've seen who argues that a particular theory of science is nonsense often has little to no proper understanding of what they're trying to refute.
58,"From personal experience, religious people approach this pre loaded with confidently incorrect answers. And then don’t listen or try to understand what they are told. 

If anyone wants the answers, we can’t yet extrapolate beyond the singularity of the “big bang” and the earth is so full of life right now that anything approaching life would get eaten immediately."
59,r/SelfAwarewolves
60,Science uses methods to prove or disprove any theory or logic and also provides critical analysis to illogical thoughts such as creationism.
61,"Who created GOD then? And why aren't you praying to him? 

Watch the meltdown."
62,Hahahahahah never thought I would see creationist and logic in the same sentence. You put them in the same box as flat earth group
63,This sounds a lot like he is saying that doing science is too hard so i'm going to take the easy way out and say God did everything and leave it at that.
64,Yet will happily believe their God can just always exist without an origin story or whatever.
65,"""Dot of nothing""

No...its a singularity, saying anything other than just it was a singularity that expanded at this time is pure dishonesty."
66,"thats the whole thing with science though, isn’t it? If we had all the answers there would be no need for it anymore. Plus, why deny people the joy of discovery? why do you cling to your old, disproven books?"
67,"Where did the “rotation stopped for a day” thing come from, that one was new to me."
68,"So asking when and where the nothing the universe came from is a nonsensical question, and clearly shows this person doesn't understand the subject well enough to be able to say it's wrong.  Time and space didn't exist until the Big Bang.  We don't have the capacity to visualise that, nor do we have the language, as the very sentence ""time and space didn't exist until the Big Bang"" implies there was a before.  It's like asking what's north of the North Pole.  The answer is nothing.  You've reached the end of everything you can measure by that metric, and can't go any further."
69,It is not half explained if they didn't read half of it!
70,"""I prefer my god fantasy not your life rocks fantasy."""
71,"post this to r/selfawarewolves too, this would be fitting there"
72,We have evidence of the big bang though... We find background radiation that came from it pretty much everywhere...
73,"""where"" it was just there, we don't know where, though we may be able to figure it out if we could get there reliably 
""when"" what the fuck? isn't that something you can just look up on google?
""where did it come from"" it was just a bunch of gas at the start, it wasn't already formed
""how does life come from rocks, why doesn't it happen now"" it probably does happen now! on other planets that can hold life, yes, but it's possible!"
74,Critical thinking out the window..
75,It doesn't matter that science can't explain those things yet. They will use mental gymnastics regardless. They are missing the point of science. Science tries to explain the world in a tangible way. They prefer magic.
76,"WTF is a dot of nothing? Where do they get this “Everything came from nothing” crap. They have to misrepresent the Big Bang theory, to make their god who somehow came from nothing plausible."
77,Creation and Realists in the same sentence. Hmmm
78,Science can fly you to the moon. Religion will fly you into the side of a skyscraper.
79,I trust the Big Bang more than “the man in the clouds spoke it into existence”
80,"Ah, the classic ""if science can't already deliver 100% fully formed explanations *for everything*, that meet my personal definition of ""proven"" and also make me feel special enough to accept them, then it's all invalid and you must accept my grand unified theory of everything: a wizard did it."""
81,"If nothing can exist without a creator, then who created god?"
82,"I had a running bit-joke I would do all the time because everyone always laughed at it, sometimes to the point of tears. I could never figure out why people laughed so hard every time, I just figured I told the joke really well. 

The joke would come out whenever the topic of egos would come up in conversation, I would pretend like I was holding  my head except it was massive as I stumbled around pretending to not be able to fit through the door, and proclaiming 'my head has so big due to my massive ''ego''

It was a very sad day when I realized people weren't laughing at the joke for the same reason I had been because up until the age of 25, I thought Ego and Libido meant the same thing. So at some point in front of my parents, friends, guest, and coworkers, I was walking around with my arms stretched out saying 'my head is so big due to my massive libido. 

It is also the same day I realized I'm a total dumbass."
83,"I think it's important with debates about the origins of the universe to delineate between religious evangelist fruit cakes that think the Earth is 10,000 years old, and people like me that believe in the idea that there is an infinite being that did in fact create initial matter. If you want to call that being god, call it god. 

No one can explain how something can always have existed, so the argument of an infinite being that created matter, or matter always existing, is pretty much the same in my view."
84,Did matt powell white this?
85,What a really long fucking way of saying they didnt pay attention in science class or any class for that matter
86,Something from nothing lmao
87,Creationists are deeply uncomfortable with the unknown so they make up a story to explain it.
88,"The first episode of Quark Science discusses the topic of ""nothing"" and the Big Bang. Not that this guy could be troubled to learn a thing or two."
89,"Logic is too kind, I would call it idiocy"
90,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
91,The same questions that they are asking their theory has no answer for
92,"Wait, why would god stop earth's rotation for a day? How could it be a day if a day is defined by one rotation of the earth and the earth was stopped rotating?"
93,"How does life came from rock why doesn't it happen now.
1. Man , study evolution please. Especially Abiogeneis.
2. It does , we still aren't technologically advance yet to see it in other planets/galaxy/universe. We still can produce them in labs. 
3. God doesn't heal wounds , medicine does. Why does god give cancer to 4 year old and even younger. Why is he against abortion and a guy loving another guy"
94,"The earth didn't stop rotating. There was a normal solar eclipse during the battle, recorded by Chinese civilization.

This means that the storytellers took a normal event and creatively edited it into a supernatural event.

The Bible is simply a record of nature edited for the purpose of manipulation and control."
95,Well tbf...scientific researches are often just models and many of them are guesses.
96,"In all fairness conceiving of the Big Bang as the beginning of everything not only lacks supporting evidence but would also require an external force to set everything in motion. There’s plenty of alternative theories, some of which align with our known data better than the Big Bang Hypothesis. The resit is just a ridiculous tirade against a field (science) which will implicitly be incomplete so long as it exists."
97,"The Big Bang Theory IS an explanation...creationists like this have little if any knowledge of the theories they rail against, and never even bother to apply ANY skepticism to their own beliefs...just everything that opposes those beliefs."
98,"I love how they try to crap all over the Big Bang, when in reality it was theorized by a devoutly religious Catholic priest, and the term ""big bang"" was originally a way of making fun of its religiously inspired origins. Poor dude just can't catch a break, can he?"
99,"Am I the only one laughing at the fact that these people really believe that god stopped earth’s rotation 😂😂 
They really don’t know the implications of that happening 🤣"
100,"I grew up Christian and as a kid I used to actually buy into this shit.

The idea of God creating the Big Bang was really neat and easy to digest.

But then it begs the question of who created God? 

When I asked about it, you know what people would tell me? He created himself. How does that make sense? ""Don't try to understand it, God is just so powerful that he's beyond human understanding.""

I can't believe I used to believe that. Its 'beyond' logic because there is no logic. It's just brainwashing."
