1,"Can someone break it to her, that she eats for Energy and what Electricity is?"
2,"JFC, it's a game for kids. If you don't understand it, fine, just say you don't get it and move on. Doesn't mean it is demonic."
3,I wonder if she paid attention to physics in school.... scratch that. If she teaches her kid physics while home schooling.
4,"Blatant denial of science is evil in MY religion, so let's make a deal:

They get no pokemon in McDonald's stuff

We get accurate, comprehensive science in all curriculums, public and private."
5,This is the exact thing my mom used to say about Pok√©mon when I was growing up. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to watch it. Let alone have any of the cards. I have an 8 year old son now and we have watched both old and new Pok√©mon together. All the movies. We are a Pok√©mon household now.
6,"\> won't allow anything that's not ""of God"" into their lives

\> literally just ate at McDonald's"
7,I wonder how many Energy Star products she owns.
8,"Her issue is that they capitalize Energy like how they capitalize God? Does she know how proper nouns work? Does Karen think she is a god if she writes her name with a K instead of a k? 

Also she‚Äôd have an aneurism learning German."
9,"Idiot Christians: gAy pEoPlE cAnT rAiSe cHiLdReN!! tHeY wIlL sCaR tHeM fOr lIFe!! 

Also Idiot Christians: CHILDREN NO!! THAT PIECE OF CARDBOARD SAID THE WORD ENERGY!! ITS DEMONIC!!"
10,"Monster Energy drink is also the devil

-her, maybe"
11,"Whenever the satanic scare guy came to our church every year, it meant the end of most cartoons, like The Smurfs (there was a sorcerer), Care Bears (the Care Bear stare is witchcraft that gets more powerful with more of them involved), He-Man (there‚Äôs only one ‚ÄúMaster of the Universe‚Äù), etc. as well as our Cabbage Patch Kids (named after demons), Teddy Ruxpin (possessed by demons), and other popular toys. 

This is nothing new and religious fruitcakes will always make themselves feel superior by pointing out the unholiness of things they avoid‚Ä¶ even when it‚Äôs all entirely imagined."
12,"‚ÄúEastern religion‚Äù. Buddhism is older than Christianity by at least half a century. Hinduism is twice as old as Christianity. But no, Karen and her cross have definitely got the only correct religion ever."
13,Pokemon clearly a new age eastern religion. Before we know it they will be controlling the govt and trying to impose their ways on the population.
14,"Not understanding that ""Energy,"" in this context is capitalized because it's a category of cards in the game, and not because it's being deified."
15,[deleted]
16,I have no words for this. How dumb can you be?
17,Christian fundie should read the OT with her eyes wide open to see for herself what imaginary monster üëø that she has been worshipping.
18,Cmon man don‚Äôt do this to smeargle
19,Have fun when your kids don‚Äôt ever talk to you again post 18 years of age lol.
20,Guess we can add proper nouns to the list of things weird Christians hate for incomprehensible reasons
21,"My mother was like this growing up. No Care Bears, demonic. No Rainbow Brite, demonic. No Smurfs, demonic. No trick or treating, demonic. No  comic books, Disney movies, secular music, My Little Ponies or Cabbage Patch kids dolls. Why? You guessed it. 

A visiting revival preacher said if you put a Cabbage Patch doll in a fire you could hear the screams of the demon exiting the toy. Like that doesn‚Äôt scar a child‚Ä¶"
22,"11.  Thou shalt not play Pokemon.  Their god must be very fragile to be threatened by Pikachu.

My mother was just like this with Dungeons & Dragons when I was a kid, my imaginary elf prayed to an imaginary god that wasn't Christian so the whole game was the work of Satan."
23,"It very well could be satire, but we had to deal with self-righteous nutjobs like this in the 80's with the ""Satanic panic"" over D & D and heavy metal albums."
24,No one gonna tell her Christianity is an Eastern religion?
25,"It is extremely sad how religion can get a sane, decent person to this point of delusion."
26,"I had an art teacher in highschool (parents sent me to a Christian private school) that had the same ideals about ‚Äúenergy‚Äù and eastern religion and what not. She also was a bit mental tbh, hard to have a normal conversation with her as she‚Äôd often start mumbling incoherent things occasionally."
27,It's 2022 and Pokemon is *still* demonized? At least the others weren't forgetting about literal basic physics...
28,Time is a flat circle
29,"These people who claim to be Christians are, in fact, Evangelicals-an offshoot of Christianity that is ideologically at odds with Jesus's message. Also Christianity IS an Eastern religion ffs, Jesus didn't come from Missouri- these people are psycho"
30,What is eastern religion?
31,"Love how the crazies come so close but then veer right off a cliff.  ""This crazy fake magic game is waaay to close to my totally real religion"" it must be the devil."
32,Has this nutcase ever been to a science class as a kid?
33,"Tbf, I would have sold my soul for some energy cards when I was 8. I had no idea how tf you were supposed to get enough to actually play with when you were lucky to get one energy card in a base pack."
34,"> capitalized like it's deified 

The same as her name is? And likely her child's name?

Blasphemers"
35,"Oh its pastor Jamie Morgan, she deleted the post, she has a website and posts insane shit constantly."
36,"*call me old school and fanatical*

At least she's self aware about being outdated and crazy"
37,I can't wait for their kids to rebel against Jesus and become witches enjoying all the energy they want
38,...but McDonald's is totally godly
39,Imagine only getting one life and spending it so joylessly.
40,ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
41,"I can just see her screaming at her meal replacement bar for telling her the amount of ""Calories (Energy)"" it has."
42,"I agree with her that capitalized keywords in card games should be kept at a minimum unless absolutely necessary, otherwise it‚Äôs too intimidating for new players."
43,"Pokemon is the thing that started my deconversion. I was in 8th grade, and one day my pastor told everyone that pokemon was demonic and a bunch of stuff like that. My mom bought it and threw away all my cards and games. It was the first time something came up in church that I knew for a fact wasn't true, and it's what made me start looking at other things through that new lens."
44,"My super religious mom threw away all of my Pok√©mon cards when I was younger claiming they were evil. 

She claimed I stopped having nightmares at night right after she threw them away too to confirm her bias. 

I‚Äôm a grown ass man now and I‚Äôm still mad about that."
45,"Ah this was the reason my mom tore up all of my Yu Gi Oh cards when I was thirteen (I had such a big collection too, it still upsets me). She replaced them with a little porcelain angel as an ""apology"". I like the angel, don't get me wrong, it's cute, but it doesn't replace that collection in the slightest."
46,The Vatican actually said that pokemon is cool bc its based on friendship
47,"Energy Attached huh? So devices with a built-in non removable battery are forbidden too? They do have a container of Energy Attached, surely that qualifies"
48,"This isn't the first time I've heard of this nonsense. I worked at burger King years ago when they had the pokemon mewtoo promotion (FYI go to snag a few of the gold cards with the stands, because of the cuteness üòç, and still have them in a display case with my sons Lego builds). Had a lady come in adamant that pocket monsters were the work of the devil and she needed something in the kids meal that wasn't devilish and she knew we didn't make the marketing decision but the higher upside should be ashamed of themselves. It was one of my more interesting days there to be sure. But tldr some people are just nucking futz."
49,I feel so sorry for the kid. Playing Pok√©mon with my friends was one of my good childhood memories.
50,Fast forward 20 years and same woman will be complaining on Facebook how her kids don't talk to her anymore and cut her out of their lives.
51,"Wow, where was that person in the 90s? Lol"
52,This was my parents
53,Poor kids.
54,I went out & got 3 happy meals because of this post
55,Better throw out your phone too than. Cause that's another thing she probably doesn't understand to the point of being magical.
56,I bet playtime at their house is a barrel of laughs.
57,**She looks like a Karen**
58,Here we go again‚Ä¶
59,bitch don‚Äôt throw those away give em to me
60,She certainly has a lot of energy for denying energy
61,Jesus Christ and his flip-flops. I can‚Äôt with people.
62,Idiot woman istg
63,Classic signs of hypoxia /s
64,Haven‚Äôt seen this one in a long time. Bringing back the classics I see
65,Always get riled up and ready to go to war on these posts then I remember it isn‚Äôt the person who said that asinine crap that will be reading this‚Ä¶
66,Wouldn‚Äôt overcoming temptation make you a better religious‚Ä¶ite than simply avoiding it? Why go through world on easy mode?
67,"Ok, for those who have a functioning brain, the reason ""Energy"" is capitalized is because in the game there are Energy cards. To ""attach"" an Energy is to take an Energu card from your hane and place it by a pokemon card you have in play"
68,This is the kind of belief system I was raised in. Fuckin' bonkers.
69,Someone should tell her that playing cards evolved from a divination technique. She'll never play Solitaire again!
70,My mom and dad said Pok√©mon was demonic. So I played at my friends house but couldn‚Äôt have cards of my own.
71,Photosynthesis scares the shit out of her
72,"She won't have ""Energy attached"" in her home.

Call the electricity company, let them know to drop by and cut her off."
73,She capitalizes McDonald's in the post. Is she deifing McDonald's?
74,She hit the nail on the head herself there. Fanatical seems the right descriptor
75,"...sorry, she thinks nouns are capitalised only if they're deified?  Has she really never heard of proper nouns?  Or does she think, say, London is a god?"
76,"You know, sad thing is that if she actually read what the rules mean and how they work instead of having a knee-jerk reaction to what she perceives as Eastern religion, I don't think she'd really object to this. There are specific cards that provide energy for performing certain actions. You attach them to the cards you've played so that you can attack your opponent, but there are limits to how much energy you can attach in a single turn, so there's a strategic element there ‚Äî use quick but light attacks, or try to build up to something more devastating.

I'm making the big assumption that she at least understands the concept of energy from a physics perspective, and that she has an inkling of how strategy works in games like chess or Monopoly. That's probably too generous of an assumption, but I want to believe Evangelicals aren't quite THIS idiotic."
77,"It's all relative.  She doesn't want anything that is not ""Of God,"" in her family's life, but she takes them to Macdonald's.   Macdonald's is ""Of God""?"
78,Does she know Christianity began in middle east?
79,Yawn!
80,What the fuck is the clown babbling about?
81,"Honestly I think people like this use religion as an excuse to be assholes to people. ""No! I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just telling you what I think Jesus would want."""
82,"Worked with a guy who told me a story about how he was watching Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid and someone on the show went ""These cards are your life!"" and his dad yelled ""You don't need those cards, you need Jesus!""

&#x200B;

And that was the last time his parents ever let him watch that show."
83,"When you believe your imaginary stuff is real, it makes other people's imaginary stuff worrisome.

Why, if my book is true, *any* book could be! Better hide Harry Potter and D&D from my kids."
84,This brought back a memory I had totally forgotten about. This was back in like 1982 and the neighbor kid's mom wouldn't let him listen to the radio or anything. He had to catch a ride with us to school 1 morning and my mom always played the radio and this fucker covered his ears the entire way to school because of AM radio. He also was walking home from the bus stop 1 day and covered his ears because we were listening to the Thriller album as he walked by.
85,PTSD
86,I work at McDonald's and it's just a deal to get kids back into playing Pokemon. Geez
87,McDonald's has pokemon?
88,"As a pokemon, the only thing demonic about the game is Cynthia.

Seriously, that woman will fuck you raw if you aren't prepared."
89,Wtaf. They got a tynamo card?? I wanted a tynamo fucking card. AND they threw it away?
90,"Religion and stupidity, find me a better duo. I‚Äôll wait."
91,Its a fucking typo LOL!!!!
92,Had a friend growing up who's grandpa went over to their house and took his Pok√©mon + Yu-Gi-Oh cards and tossed them in a bonfire for a similar reason.
93,So no Red Bull either then? It‚Äôs an ENERGY drink.
94,HaRRy PoTTeR iS WiTcHcraFT!
95,I hope this woman is sad most of the time
96,"Someone let her know that lights (including the sun) are energy attached, so she has to stay as far away from any source of heat or light possible. The only safe place for her is the cold, dark void of deep space."
97,"Wait until she finds out that christianity is an ""Eastern Religion"""
98,"I feel bad for the kid, I was in his position once."
99,Ugh. This sounds like something straight out of the Jack Chick tracts.
100,"Clearly the term ""fictional"" is untranslatable to people this stupid."
