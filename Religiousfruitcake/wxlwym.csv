1,"Even with hyper-""modest"" clothing and probably the values to go with that, you're still assumed to be leading men astray. (And of course, mingling with non-believers is even more proof of her faithless intentions.) It's baffling."
2,"Best case scenario, she gets the hell away from the rest of the magic sky-daddy gang and does what she wants for a change.

But they always do their best to drag people back in."
3,"I really thought for a second that he was trying to uwu when he put :3 

Whemen stay in hwome plz :3"
4,Conservative Christians have the same thoughts. Funny how go hand in hand.
5,"Good for her, that’s a big accomplishment"
6,This is exactly why we don't need religion.
7,"Yeah how dare she not be uneducated and easily controllable! 

&#x200B;

/s in case people on here don't understand sarcasm"
8,Good job for her for getting that degree
9,.... Yeah... That's what Islam teaches
10,Islam is ridiculous lol
11,I hope she finds a good career with her degree in Ninjitsu.  (and Microbiology)
12,Allah can suck deez nuts
13,Smart enough to get into and graduate from oxford .. not smart enough to take off that garb and leave that cult..
14,"Are you allowed to hand it to her?

Do you insert the diploma into the eye slit?"
15,"I do not agree with the ninja garb.

It appeases incels."
16,How do they know it's her when she sits an exam? Could be anyone under that bin liner.
17,"Honestly I have no empathy for Women who wear niqab “by choice” when they are attacked by their Muslim brothers like this. 

You chose to follow literally Islam by wearing niqab, then follow the other orders of God as well, including staying at home and becoming a baby maker."
18,"Real ""leopard ate my face"" material. Imagine letting someone convince you into hating yourself so much that the sight of your body is considered obscene and you voluntarily wear a full body veil, only to be told blatantly by the people you're trying to please that they hate you for contributing more to society than your organs"
19,Hopefully this is the first step towards independence for the young lady.
20,how do they know it was the same person who started the school?...
21,"A win for her,  a loss for logic and equality. 

The idea itself is stupid as hell."
22,The bachelor of civil law masters degree?
23,I'm more confused by the degree. A Bachelor's degree that is also a Master's? How? Someone please explain.
24,First time oxford has admitted a mailbox to it's program?
25,"And she's mixing with men without a male relative there with her everyday, so unislamic tsk tsk."
26,Not really. It’s bigotry of multiple types disguised as religious righteousness. Pretty standard reason for people to get into religion in the first place. Nothing justifies hate like: GOD WILLS IT!
27,"How did it go? Let's compromise, says the fascist, so you take a step towards him, but he steps back. Let's compromise, says the fascist.

She could be shackled to a kitchen sink and they'd still claim this and require her to give up warm water."
28,We must kiw the infadews uwu
29,"*notices your hadiths*

OwO what's this? :3"
30,Weaw hwijabb UwU
31,"Yea, but Muslims seems to be more loud and cavalier about it. Christians seem to say it in hush hush tones behind closed doors mostly."
32,"Christianity, too. Misogynistic bs is rampant in these religions."
33,that's not it Islam didn't straight up said women should stay at home and cook there's a lot and I mean a lot of Muslims who have their sister's and wife's work outside only people who don't let thers sister's or wife's etc go to work outside are the closed minded ones and the ones who changed the meaning of verses in Quran please understand that most Muslims let their wife's and sister's work outside.
34,I'm Muslim myself and no Islam didn't say to women to stay at their home and just work and cook only people who thinks that are the ones who thinks women as an objects there's a lot of Muslims who have their sisters wife's etc work too Islam didn't say women shouldn't work.
35,Maybe this will be the first step down a better path.
36,"Yeah this is the only thing i find weird here, how can you get into a prestigious school and be furthering yourself as a person but not realizing what youre doing is directly against your faith and not realizing you have the choice to leave it"
37,"To be fair, Christians cherry-pick rules to follow all the time too. Maybe she kept the niqab to showcase her Muslim identity and COVID got us used to cover our faces anyway."
38,Any woman on staff is allowed to see her face
39,"To be fair, some traditionally Christian countries became rich, democratic and secular enough not to follow Christianity to the letter. Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina are probably quite secular as well."
40,Come to rural Nebraska.
41,"You messed up on ""they let them..."", She isn't theirs to need permission."
42,"Whatever a woman does in Islam, she needs male permission. Wether it be the father, brother or husbando. Fuck that shit"
43,"You know as well as I do that Muslim Men don’t treat Muslim woman equally. 

Woman are objects in Islam."
44,Then why do you guys allow these people to ruin Islam if what you are saying is true?
45,[deleted]
46,👏👏👏
47,not All men don't treat women equally in Islam really
48,Sure. I agree with you but that’s not what Islam teaches correct?
49,"أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُوا النِّسَاءَ كَرْهًا وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا بِبَعْضِ مَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّـهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا}.[٣]
This verse is saying
O you who believe in god don't hate women and treat them good if you hate them at least you might hate something god made a lot of great things in 

مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِنْ ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ}.[٤]

In this verse god is saying he don't care if you are male or female as long you do good things in life and believe in him you will achieve heaven


إنَّ اللهَ يُوصِيكُم بالنساءِ خيرًا، إنَّ اللهَ يُوصِيكُم بالنساءِ خيرًا، فإنهنَّ أمهاتُكم وبناتُكم وخالاتُكم، إنَّ الرجلَ من أهلِ الكتابِ يتزوجُ المرأةَ وما تُعلَّقُ يداها الخيطَ، فما يرغبُ واحدٌ منهما عن صاحبِه حتّى يموتا هَرمًا).[٢]

That's not verse from Quran but that's the prophet words

He's saying god wants you men to protect women
Then the prophet say women are like your mother's sisters and daughters
As means he is saying you should respect them and treat them right like they are your sister or mother"
50,"God wants men to protect woman.

So the answer is to oppress them? That’s called abuse."
51,"Countries that have Islam as the state religion protect women very well in their freedom of movement, the right to drive, the right to work, the right to have access to healthcare, the right to choose a husband when they are ADULTS, etc. ..

/s of course."
52,"Can you quote these?? How do you know they’re the prophets words if it’s not in the koran?

Let’s all ignore the fact that men are allowed to beat women, women get less inheritance than men, a female witness is half that of a male one, a woman can’t say no to sex otherwise angels will curse her like wtf?

Also Islam sexualises everything about women. From their hair to their voices to their sole existence."
53,What country bestie I need receipts. I swear women weren’t allowed to drive in Saudi until recently? And in Dubai women can’t even open their own bank accounts without male permission. Muslim countries are garbage
54,"I should have added the /s at the end of my message, because I meant that they were protected, like excluded or prevent. I will edit to be clearer."
55,"Oh bro I’m sorry, I was fuming at the misogyny and didn’t read the adult part💀"
56,"I understand you, sometimes anger takes over and I may have misspoken too. 💜"
