1,"Read Genesis. Would make a non believer out of anyone. 

Every chapter contradiction to the one before it. Choose 4 , Cain Abel and later Seth. But others may attack Cain.

Chat 5, Seth, and many other daughters and sons, no Cain or Abel.

There are 2 creation storied in Genesis, one opposite from the other in order of creation. How did anyone ever believe this twaddle?"
2,"And then came the great flood, were only 8 humans survived, and 4 of them were direct blood relatives."
3,"Ah yes..bad genes and the risk of even worse genes is why pretty much everyone is against incest. 

I'm sure we're all thinking ""I'd definitely f*ck my brother/sister if only we had better and stronger genes"" right?....right?"
4,I wonder which one of Adam’s kids was Black and which one was Asian.
5,Adam and Eve were Spock and Number One?
6,The hell are “perfect genes”? And why are Adam and Eve white with brown hair???
7,"I am pretty sure that, if anyone asked Trump, he would also say:

""I have the best genes, perfect genes, nobody knew that genes could be to perfect!""

So that allows his leering at his daughter, in a way. ;)"
8,"Well, it's ok in current Republican morals as well."
9,Which group has groomer elements agian?
10,Did people take it literally at first or was it just moral stories (like I think maybe they’re supposed to be?).
11,this one makes sense actually
12,Were Adam and Eve perhaps from Alabama?
13,So you be sayin that morality is...subjective?
14,"""They had perfect genes then"" is one of my favorite creationist excuses that doesn't actually solve any problem. It's not the ""quality"" of the genes, it's the fact that God made one man out of dirt, then cloned a woman from him, and then literally the entire human population descended from them. There just aren't enough different genes to get what we see today in humanity. Making their genes extra-special does nothing!"
15,"But then Cain was expelled to the land of Nod? I guess there were already people there or something. I'm a recovering Christian, 24 years and counting"
16,"If they had perfect genes what happened in the meantime?

Did god do something about it?"
17,"Technically correct as depicted in the Bible

Still nonsense but canon"
18,God permitted incest simply because that was the only way of repopulating.
19,That’s because it was compiled from the works of four people who wrote their own accounts of the story and were later edited together.
20,"In Genesis 6:4, it talks about the sons of God having children with the daughters of man. The case has been made that this means that there were other humans living outside the Garden of Eden, and Adam’s children intermingled with them."
21,">How did anyone ever believe this twaddle?

Mushrooms.

They had some really, *really* good mushrooms."
22,The entire old testament is just a compilation of different stories from multiple different cultures lazily glued together into one book. They don't make sense together because they were never meant to be read together.
23,"remember, we established incest was okay back then."
24,"My neighborhood cats keep fucking each other, having liters before we can trap/fix them and they seem fine, one is kind of derpy but the rest are pretty cool."
25,[deleted]
26,"only thing keeping 95% of the Bible belt

shame really, you waste perfectly good siblings because an omniscient and omnipotent God couldn't have possibly made perfect genes that stayed perfect through unlimited incest over the ages."
27,"As the garden of Eden was most likely in Ethiopia, probably all his kids were black. God turned people white as a curse (exodus story of Miriam). Not sure when god made Asian people. But he must have blessed them with superior intelligence and wealth, as they were specifically referred to as “wisemen” in the New Testament and were able to freely give out expensive gifts."
28,"I think it's said that the split came with Noah's sons, not with Adam's."
29,"Every group of humans on earth probably, because we can all be awful creatures if we choose to."
30,Why didn't god just make more people? Sounds like bullshit to me.
31,"Yeah, if they had just taken just one of the accounts, it would have made a lot more sense.

/S"
32,"Although indeed there were different voices in the pentatuch,  the traditions were from totally different epochs and were amalgamated. No real history. 180% opposite stories. As folk lore it is interesting. As a reason to go to wars and abuse non-believers, it is just a fraud."
33,"Actually these are just stories of different universes in the multiverse. So they are all true at the same time.

Marvel is all part of Gods plan."
34,"Yep, exactly. And on top of that, the stories were passed down orally for a few hundred years before ever being written down. So lots of different versions existed, and were all crammed together. It is why there is so much contradiction in the bible. It is all over the place, and mixes views and stories from all kinds of other religions. I don't think there is one story in the entire bible unique to it. Even Jesus is ripped off of much older religions."
35,"Which, of.course, makes the whole story bogus of Adam and Eve as believed by  believers in a mythology which is totally inconsistent."
36,"Finally, an answer I can get behind!!!!!"
37,"Aesop's Fables
1001 Arabian Nights
Bible"
38,"I hear it's down to the perfect genes, but I'm not too sure which verse of Genesis tells us that. For all i know, the whole thing maybe made up."
39,"Modern humans have been around for at least 100,000 years. At a guess, population growth was more hindered by infant mortality rates than birth rates."
40,How did he *ehem* split them?
41,"Most kids wouldn't question this and the ones that would would probably get the Devil beaten out of them. Seems like an easy fix would have been Adam and Eve being his first chosen ones, and not the only people."
42,"It honestly probably would, since the earth would only be created once."
43,yeah it would have. bacause 0x10 is still 0.
44,"Sure, but there probably is some actual history in the Bible, heavily distorted history, but some of the stuff in it probably did happen, but it’s hard to tell which."
45,"nah, God totally made a dude, ripped his rib bone to make a gal.  have them bang and incest orgy.  

And then years later, totally told some guy to write that shit down."
46,Infant mortality would have had to have been massive compared to any point that we know of in history then.
47,"As someone born and raised in a religious cult, 100% agree. Questions are not encouraged. I habitually ""embarrassed"" my parents by asking questions and that really served as an eye-opener for me."
48,And 4 people were there to observe and write about it /s
49,"History is very incidental. Genesis is an amalgamation of a lot of other religions mythology,  And interesting for that."
50,Not really think about the magical parts compared to the parts where there just in there shed one time just doing something regular. Now go back to when Abraham or ed gein started hearing voices in their heads now that's actual magic. Actually it could've happened except it wasn't good it was actual scripts of mental illness.
51,Wait the rib has Adam's DNA so they would have the same DNA right?
52,no shit Sherlock
53,Ha ha ha.  Stories change in the telling.
54,True.
55,I believe that more than the bible itself.
56,"Sure, you can rule bits out, but we have no way to know from the text alone if a particular city was razed to the ground or if it was just largely destroyed or what.  If this battle actually occured etc."
57,You seem like a really great person
58,What battle?
59,A lot of the battles in the bible where israel is invading someone or other.
60,"Oh yea well i haven't read the bible myself  but I've heard the stories since I was a kid somewhat. What about those wars even if they did happen which were in the ordering of god then that reason is complete bullshit. Though they did take over they use god as a means to have control that's their only excuse, which is a fucked up, one because they didn't do good for anyone else but themselves."
61,"Jericho, where they killed all, even infants, raped then killed the women, except those they kept as sex slaves.
Exactly as their God commanded them to do, which amazingly is exactly what they wanted to do!!!"
62,"It obviously didn’t happen like they say, but there may have been a battle, which has been drastically distorted in the telling, just like how there was probably an actual trojan war but it didn’t happen like homer said it did."
63,"Totally agree..Just relating the story of the god of the old testament. As he says of himself, ""a jealous god""!

Which I find amusing."
