1,"He promises to come back, and never does."
2,"I'll believe it when I see it. It's been 2000 years and even though he's ""all powerful"" he hasn't won yet."
3,Spoiler alert for people who believe the bible:  Your god fucking HATES people.
4,"Christ wins.. what? The mere suggestion that the son of the universe's all-knowing, all-powerful creator ""wins"" at anything implies there was competition. So.. the all-knowing, all-powerful creator created atheists and other religions just to ""defeat"" them by pretending to be nonexistant and appealing to the biggest idiots on the planet?"
5,Fiction almost always ends in happy endings.
6,"Did he?

Last I looked, Satan was in charge of one of our two major political parties, and is able to coerce a whole lot of God's most devout followers into doing heinous acts they wouldn't do otherwise."
7,He lost to the Romans.
8,">SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BIBLE...

You mean Christians?"
9,Book report from the kid who never actually read the book.
10,"""Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!” When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number. And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."" 

Seems like he won here too! He just keeps winning, so much winning! Take that you unrule YOUTHS!"
11,Only thing that twat won was a free acupuncture.
12,Spoiler alert: The heat death of the universe
13,I've read it twice.  Least convincing stories ever told.
14,"He promised to come back within the lifetime of his own generation. 

He's a little overdue for that."
15,"He 'wins' like Ned Stark 'wins.' 

Gets murdered near the beginning, causes trouble for everyone else for years after."
16,Didn't get killed and then was called home by his daddy? Wouldn't call that a win
17,I hate how it just jumps the shark and has the character just be alive again and declare himself the victor.
18,"God made everything, even evil just to... Fight it and win. We're all extras on a board game he made himself with arbitrary rules for the sole purpose of him winning and not getting bored."
19,"No he doesn’t 

He fucking died lmao"
20,Not exactly a spoiler to find out that the protagonist wins in a work fo fiction.
21,"Spoiler alert, Snape kills jesus"
22,yea but as far as fiction books go i would say it sucks 1/10. Try lord of the rings or harry potter next time it is way better...
23,God sacrificed himself to himself to appease himself.
24,I hate it when the bad guy wins in the end.
25,... and they all lived happily ever after. The end.
26,Pretty sure he dies on the cross and never returns but sure...
27,"Yeah yeah, but who wins in Batman vs Superman? Never watched it."
28,"Spoiler for the Christians, who didn't read the bible, it says life starts at birth and never mentions gay people."
29,"Yeah, that nails it down once and for all."
30,"Christ dies, I’d hardly call that winning"
31,"That’s like being smug Harry Potter beats Voldemort. They wrote it, of course they wrote their protagonist to win."
32,"Atheists and members of every other religion for the past 2000 years: ""I'd like to see him try.""

Christians for the past 2000 years: ""Just you wait!""

Annnnnd crickets."
33,"Doubtful...he couldn't even hold his own against some Roman dbags....now, you think he's gonna cone back and take on the U.S. government? Good luck, buddy...see you in guantanamo"
34,🤣
35,"Even if he does come back, many of these people would find him standing opposite them and not with them..."
36,"didn't jesus fucking die, came back and left"
37,"If you think you're dumb, people thought Jesus would come back in the 1800s."
38,"Uuughh my mother says this all the time. “ I’m not afraid because I’ve read the end of the book and know who wins!” 😮‍💨🤦‍♀️

And yet when I call church ‘Worlds Biggest Bookclub’ I get all sorts of yelled at 😂"
39,"Frodo and Harry Potter also win, but I’m not gonna go scream about it with a Sandwich board on a street corner."
40,Cthulhu would like to have a word with this christ person.
41,"Actually, he croaks and then runs off to his daddy!"
42,He’s coming back any day now.
43,Doesn’t he die but then brings the ultimate cliche of spiritual revival?
44,"Good, you saved me from reading an overlong and dull book."
45,"If God is omniscient and omnipotent, and has chosen the winners before these events, why is this even going to happen? Asking for a friend"
46,"doesn't christ pretty unilaterally lose? Like, the earth is ruined despite any divine intervention and the best solution is to just beam all the believers like an evacuation, sounds like a massive loss"
47,As far as religious memes go this is pretty innocent
48,I wouldn't call it winning when you get nailed to two pieces of lumber....
49,Uhm.. that’s not at all how the Bible ends
50,Gets tortured to death though.
51,This saved me so much time.
52,"I always refer the book of revelation as ""the last season of the bible"""
53,He looses and fails to write the sequel where he actually liberates lsreal.
54,"It’s like the human version of an abandoned puppy waiting for its abusive family to come back for it, but it’s also kinda funny. 

Not ‘haha funny’, but ‘back away slowly’ funny"
55,So did Frodo.
56,Really?  I thought the seven headed dragon showed up with 11 swords and blew out the 19 candles and sat down on the white folding chair of Babylon.
57,That's just hearsay...
58,"And you loose because I’m pretty sure you eat bacon,sinner."
59,Funny way of winning
60,"Oh, that's so clever. /s"
61,"Doesn't Christ have a fight at the top of the volcano and drop the ring in, before returning home to the Shire?

It's been such a long time since I read it."
62,"(Directed to the meme, not op) cool, dont give a shit"
63,Woooooow
64,Looks more like Lawrence of Arabia.
65,Nah christ just left. We got some fast forward shots at armegeddon but in any movie ive seen with a fast forward shot it never actually ends up going down the way it did in the visions. These guys need to put down the bible and pick up minority report to learn a thing or two about prophecy.
66,"While apparently leading Muslims  , cat wait for that twist"
67,"Newsflash for anyone who hasn't read Superman, Superman wins! Now bow down and worship Superman."
68,The story is then over. Yey
69,So did Harry Potter. That’s doesn’t mean I want laws based on fucking Quidditch rules!
70,"Damn I was just starting the Bible… so it’s spoiled! Whew he wins, huh? Someone told me that he died (for me?!?) so I’m glad it all worked out for him"
71,Many people have been saying what many people have been saying to them.
72,The world ends with a fuckton of horses.
73,This looks like a Hindu religious scene.
74,Isn't this a scene from LotRs? Cause I think it is.
75,Irrelevant.... just because he got to live out his weird ass fetish doesn't mean he won.
76,Aye the part where they nailed him to a fucking tree was very heroic
77,"I do believe the horseman conquest wins, like he's ahead of the game when shit gets going and the best thing is he be the only fucking thing human about the Bible."
78,The body of Christ is the ultimate jilted lover
79,He's the dad who went to get milk
80,*The Bible 2: Cucked by Christ ....coming soon*
81,Dead people don't come back to life.  No matter how much they claim a fictional god will bring them back.  It's nonsensical gibberings of a madman.
82,"If I said: ""Spoiler alert for those who haven't seen Predator, Schwarzenegger wins,"" that would be just as relevant to reality. **But Predator is just a story someone made up so you would go to a place and sit in a row and pay them your money.** Hmm..."
83,"But he caaaamme Back.


so they banished him to another island."
84,The final chapter Revelation is just copium.

93,Spoiler alert: God is not real.
94,"That is the catch, he doesnt want ppl thinking so only those who shut down their neurons and blindly believe get to not even see him"
95,"He hasn't even beaten Satan yet, infact he is apparently still out there committing unspeakable acts like supporting LGBTQ people or something"
96,*laughs in 40k*
97,Laughs in >!Final Fantasy Type Zero!<
98,Which party?
99,He lost to a hammer and nails.
100,I mean the Romans disappeared. But so did he. Let's see who's back first.
