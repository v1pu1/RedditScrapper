1,Somebody is a little too into children here.
2,"This ad is from 1822, or am I missing something."
3,Sounds like he‚Äôs looking for live stock
4,"""child bearing age girl"" is creepy as fuck."
5,"And once the children are born he can go on to ignoring them, not helping around the house and complaining that his wife isn‚Äôt as attractive as she used to be and the kids are to loud."
6,And everyone woman he meets just falls for him ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
7,He's talking like he needs a guarantee that she can bear children. If she currently has no children how would anybody f****** know? Also why is he asking for a child-bearing girl and not a child bearing woman? I hope this is a troll.
8,People need to stop saying girl when they mean woman especially in contexts like this that make it sound like they're a pedophile
9,and what does he bring to the table: nothing
10,"Lookout everybody, child-bearing Casanova over here has the market cornered on all of the nice, good looking, child-bearing women!"
11,"Or, as one of our \*Congressmen\* called them, ""earthen vessels"".   

Because he did not know that the phrase refers to pottery."
12,"Pedophile looking for child to impregnate, and call it his God given right. 

There, fixed the headline for you :)"
13,How does he know he will be able to father children?
14,Shocked isn't the reaction you really want....
15,I mean.....my lap us wet now ü§Æ
16,">good looking

Well now you're just asking for too much. Be grateful with what you get."
17,"""need a silent, obedient child machine, because I'm so great I want more of me running around.""

""Baby machine must also do all of the household chores, including having a hot meal prepared for me on demand, because mommy won't do it for me anymore.""

""Baby machine must also raise the children solely by themselves, without complaining, while I enjoy them when I feel like it and it pleases me.""

""Baby machine must silently appreciate me, and comfort me when I come home tired and exhausted from my part time job, as long as I'm not already playing videogames.""

""Baby machine must supplement income if my parents decide to stop paying my bills."""
18,"How not romantic, she will be treated like a cow."
19,Imagine using the word ‚ÄúChristendom‚Äù lol
20,Seems like a reasonable request.

24,Chris Chan vibes
25,LMFAO ‚ò†Ô∏è
26,"""child bearing age girl""

27,"Yes, his side of the contract. Like looks, wages, temperament. 

If you want to make a bargain, you have to have something to offer. I would love to know how much this asshole thinks he‚Äôs worth."
28,"A broodmare, basically."
29,"Having gone through IVF 3 times, you can predict if a couple is likely to conceive by looking at the quality of the eggs and sperm. Running a dna marker test to assure you both don‚Äôt have matching disease markers which would manifest itself as a disease in the offspring. You also discuss family history. Nothing is guaranteed but, you use the tools available to make an informed decision."
30,"He's a upstanding righteous American with a sweet Harley, what more do you want?"
31,Pedo being honest.
32,Male? Check. Xtian? Check. That‚Äôs it.
33,I get that. Two people deciding to get testing done beforehand. But this guy was talking like he's on the market to purchase likestock so he could breed her. Dude was a real nut! Lol
34,Quiverfull‚Ä¶.
