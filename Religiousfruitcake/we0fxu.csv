1,Imagine a group where ‚Äúultra MAGA queen‚Äù is a good thing
2,‚ÄúNever had a racist bone‚Äù sorry but if you‚Äôve never had a racist bone then it won‚Äôt suddenly develop into your mid adulthood lol chick‚Äôs 40 talkin about ‚Äúsuddenly I learned racism‚Äù üòê
3,Purple cross emoji = dumb enough to drown in a rainstorm
4,"BLM started in 2020. I guess there was no such thing as racism before that, right?"
5,Yet you still have a black caucus within the baptist congregation‚Ä¶ amazing ability to somehow remain in the fold with such overwhelming evidence of racism
6,Praying these people get struck by lightning üôè
7,"These people be like BLM, holocaust, residential schools and confederacy don't matter anymore cos it was their ancestors that did it, not them. But then they will tell us with a straightface that we deserve hell and eternal damnation the moment we were born because of what their imaginary ""first man and woman"" did (which is just being tricked by a danger noodle to eat a fruit. Not slavery and genocide like their ancestors)"
8,Now I have a headache.
9,"Yes, what could be more racist than being sick to your soul of seeing unarmed black people brutally executed by representatives of the law. Might as well go out and buy a white sheet."
10,Well I was already heading there anyway
11,It doesn‚Äôt make you racist. It makes people like you confront your own racism.
12,The Bureau of Land Management did nothing wrong.
13,üôè
14,To be fair I defended BLM because I live in a red state and uh well people like this exists. But they stole money. The actual BLM organization ended up being a donation scam. Much like the Trump donation scams.
15,"This is a bit off topic but if I have to hear someone say ""all lives matter"" one more time, I might fucking lose it."
16,"People saying they don't have a racist bone in their body makes them, ironically enough, sound incredibly racist"
17,You know just because someone put a bunch of cross emojis in their post doesn't make them wrong.  I think the most radical side of BLM is racist. And she's probably right.
18,"Yeah, I don't trust her"
19,Wanna see if we can trick these people into getting struck by lightning
20,"As a social movement started in 2013 under that name.

Organizations with that name and ""founders"" came later.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter for the source of 2013, being a trending hashtag after the acquittal of Zimmerman."
21,BuT aDam AnD eVE WeRE EvIL ThEY dISResPecTeD mY imAginARY fRieND!
22,Care to elaborate how?
23,"Lightning is actually heaven rays, and the goverment plants fake dead bodys for the people struck by them to hide the fact that heaven rays are real, jesus is trying to get humans in heaven useing heaven rays, but the government is trying to fool us into thinking that god isnt real so that they can take away our rights and morals, but we can stop this, jesus is reaching for us, we just have to take his ray to freedom.
Their now post this on Facebook or whatever Christians find ""unsantanic"" and you can replace jesus with other words for other religions!"
24,It opens up the conversation for people. Someone might go their whole life thinking and acting a certain way without even knowing why. When people talk openly about these things people can either be open to what‚Äôs being said and look at themselves objectively or they see it as a personal criticism and end up getting defensive and doubling down blaming the speaker for saying what‚Äôs making them uncomfortable. Either way they are confronting their own potential racial bias or inherent racism whether they are aware or not. Changing the behavior however is another situation altogether.
25,What makes someone inherently racist?
26,"Nothing. usualy it's the envirement you're raised in. If a child is told for 20 years straight that Black people are inferior (both at home and in school), and then is further reinforced in their belief by their ,,Independent Envirement"" (Coworkers, friends, spouse) then it's no suprise that they basicly think that way themselves and force that belief onto their own kids."
27,Ah I see
