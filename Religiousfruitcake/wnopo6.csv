1,"“Artillery of heaven”

I fucking can’t


Also if god is all powerful, then how is his heavenly artillery deterred by metal rods?"
2,"look how far we've come

oh wait"
3,">tokens of his displeasure

Isn’t Yahweh supposed to be super loving?"
4,"You're telling me that no less than the Almighty was disarmed by some beer-chugging MILF-fancier with a kite and a Leyden jar?

I...I just can't."
5,Apparently metal rods are god's kryptonite.
6,"The Biblical God described by many strikes me as the product of an imagination that lacks  creativity and knowledge written for people who have even less imagination. 

Why is an omnipotent God limited to lightning bolts that a Germam people hating, perpetually drunk womanizing inventor can intercept without dying?

Why would this same God need 40 days to flood the earth and another 5 months to let the water recede? Why a flood in the first place?  Why not death not pull the pillar of salt gimmick, then blow it away? Why did Noah have to build a boat big enough to hold 2 of every clean and 7 of every unclean animal when the same God poofed everything in existence a few generations ago?"
7,Yahweh seems to have a cataclysmic way of expressing it. The allegedly divine devastations might even give off the wrong impression \^ \^ ' .
8,"What are you talking about? Of course he is super loving, god just works in mysterious ways /s"
9,There's no evidence in the Bible that God loves anyone but himself
10,"I mean, there's a bit in the bible where Yahweh apparently couldn't deal with iron chariots, so you might be on to something."
11,"An army he was backing, and modern religions don’t follow the in-universe theology, where every country has a god, and Yahweh is Israels one."
