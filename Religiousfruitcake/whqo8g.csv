1,"if prayers worked, nobody would die in this world. but of course every person likes to think they are so special god is the one who saved them."
2,"So they were giving her treatments and medications, and she got better. She 'lost all bodily function,' meaning they were literally keeping her alive. But the medications didn't do anything. It was all prayer. Sure."
3,"> she lost all body function. Obviously they gave her fluid and meds which didn't help because they didn't know what to do.

So long story short, they kept her alive until they figured out what the problem was, and how to treat it, but because mum didn't understand what was going on interpreted it as ""nothing being done"", and filled the gap in her understanding with God.

> she had sepsis from a uti but they didn't and still don't know why

Huh? If you have a UTI then sepsis is a possible complication that can occur as the infection progresses. there's not really a ""why"" to it beyond that being how the body can react if the infection isn't caught and treated quick enough.

> Nothing they did with meds helped her. But as we prayed she just recovered each day.

So two things were happening - she was receiving treatment, and you were praying. But it definitely wasn't the treatment that was helping her, it was only the prayer? 

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
4,"I have these religious fuckups in the family, as my SIL lay dying from lung cancer, they were rubbing her with essential oils to cure her,"
5,I hope these people stop clogging our emergency rooms. God isnâ€™t especially considerate.
6,I'm sure it was the praying and not the antibiotics that made her better. Sure of it...
7,It's always funny to think how before every sports confrontation religious people of the same belief pray for different sides to win. How does God decide who gets to win? The one who is more righteous? His divine plan?
8,"Yeah this is like those people who went ""COVID was awful but I just kept praying and after two weeks I was totally better, God is good!"" completely ignoring the fact that's just how long it takes for most people to get through it ðŸ¤¦"
9,Sweet universe that is awful.
10,Is she better now?
11,Passed away almost 2 years ago.
12,"I'm so sorry to hear that, so they never ended up taking them to the hospital at all?"
13,"They did, she was always looking for alternative cures, and should have gone to the doctor for her rheumatoid arthritis, maybe some doctor would have caught her cancer earlier. When they found it, it was already stage 4 and then it spread to her brain extremely fast."
