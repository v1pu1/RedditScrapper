1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Poor phrasing and design. “There’s no hate like Christian love” makes the point much more clearly and effectively — and the punchline shouldn’t be the smallest text on the shirt either. And why the atom?
2,"1. This is backwards, it’s “There is no hate like Christian love” 

2. This looks like shit"
3,I don’t get the atom. And agree that statement should be reversed.
4,How is this Religious Fruit Cake?
5,"It's supposed to be reversed, ""There is no hate like Christian love"".

It's supposed to mean that one of the most hateful things in the world is what is masquerading as ""love"", ""not wanting you to end up in hell"", ""just telling you about savior and sharing the good word"", ""hating the sin not the sinner"", etc."
6,I mean I hear it a lot so you could potentially sell it.
7,"idk, whatever one's opinion, theres something in poor taste about walking around with a shirt directly trashing a group of people"
8,"Good shirt, but not a good post for this subreddit"
9,Love it
10,I like it
11,If I saw someone wearing this shirt in public I would probably think it was a bit silly
12,"Lol you're right it's supposed to be reversed but then you put down the same thing they already had. Should be ""There's no hate like Christian Love"" and then your second paragraph works"
13,"yeah, I'm a dumbass, thanks"
