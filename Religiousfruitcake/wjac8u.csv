1,"God forbid women have the choice to leave a marriage‚Ä¶ gotta keep her trapped by financial dependence, because why else would she want to be with a man?"
2,"in other words, lori (ofc it‚Äôs her, i can tell immediately lol) over here says the quiet part out loud, that a lot of these religious marriages are only keep together because the woman financially depends on the man and doesn‚Äôt have a lot of other options

which honestly sounds like a terrible foundation to build marriages on, they‚Äôre not true relationships, you‚Äôre just with each other based off necessity and that‚Äôs it. no shit women in these kinds of situations tend to be miserable"
3,"It appears God wants women to be uneducated and totally dependent on men.  This way a man can abuse his wife and she has no choice but to put up with it.  Go God!
Seriously, men who have this philosophy are very weak and can simply not handle a woman with power and decision making ability.  This type of woman challenges their tiny egos and they simply can't handle that.  Marry them young.   Keep them covered and secluded, supervise their behavior carefully,  and they will never know just how weak and spineless their husbands really are.  This is the policy in many Muslim countries and the policy of many Christian groups as well."
4,Religion keeps women enslaved.
5,So Satan's plan is making women smart.
6,"Well in that case, hail Satan!"
7,His made up statistic is backwards too.  College-educated couples are LESS likely to divorce.  Divorce rates are higher when couples marry younger.
8,""" I have nothing to offer other than money. ""

FIFY"
9,I think 'The Transformed Wife' is half of the posts on this subreddit now.
10,"Alright, then. 

Hail Satan. 

My college-educated ass is happy to get my daughter a college degree as well...I've already said no marriage before a degree, since it gives you way more options down the road. 

GenX and I watched way too women put their husbands through college just to get shit on twenty years later when he runs off with the secretary. 

Fuck that shit."
11,"ngl they had me in the first have, seemed pretty inspirational"
12,"No need to censor it, we all know who that is"
13,College education is giving us the education to realize we are better off without worthless men. You had to keep us stupid so we wouldn't leave. Says more about you than us. I don't want to raise another child.
14,"God forbid she leaves him because \_gasp\_ he finally doesn't have a financial hold over her...

If you have to stay in a relationship because of literally no other reason besides money you don't have a relationship but a tragedy..."
15,"I've got 2 daughters so, hail Satan."
16,"It's long been known that the cure for ignorance is education.

However, the cure for stupidity has never been discovered, and remains a terminal illness."
17,This is dependence not need.
18,"What if...people got married based on if they love someone and want to be with them, rather than out of desperation because they will be homeless and starving otherwise? Nah that's crazy."
19,Didn‚Äôt know satan was chill like that
20,"Doesn't seem like that ""God glue"" is very strong."
21,"That's a lot of words just to say ""I'm mad that women don't like me"""
22,"LOL if your marriage depends on your wife being dumb and desperate, that is pretty pathetic and you probably shouldn't have a wife."
23,"Satan is pro-choice, pro-feminism, pro-freedom of/from religion, pro-education, pro-lgbtq+, and the list goes on. Are we sure Satan is the baddie?"
24,"""I'm am so unlikable women would only tolerate being with me if they literally had to do so or starve to death.""

This is some incel shit. I know the one saying it is the transfromed wife, but knowing her she is just parroting something someone, probably her husband, told her."
25,"So basically they admit that if they are not obligated to do so, women have no benefit in being housewives lol"
26,"How to tell everyone that you've never been in a healthy relationship with anyone, of any kind, without actually saying it..."
27,"Lol, it's so dumb that they cant even see how dumb that statement is. I'm now dumber for reading it."
28,Oh no not educated women AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
29,Good for them!
30,Yay Satan.
31,"Satan is responsible for more women being college educated in today's world?

Damn, Satan *really is* doing God's work!

Hail Satan!"
32,"Well, they don't need men like you, that's for sure."
33,Sometimes it's so hard to believe that some Christians truly think this way.
34,How are people this ignorant?ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
35,When the Taliban are nodding in agreement with you it‚Äôs a strong indicator you‚Äôre one of the bad guys.
36,"Women are obviously just pets and not real humans. How silly to waste time and money on education at all. If they didn‚Äôt need to read or understand math to cook recipes, we wouldn‚Äôt even send them to any schooling. s/"
37,">Satan's plan for women

...so that they'll burn in hell for eternity?"
38,What a horrible situation it is that women don't *need* men anymore.
39,I thought this was gonna be good
40,"We all know this is Lori and she‚Äôs the queen of fruitcakes. You‚Äôll never find a woman that hates women more than Lori. Her husband broke what little will she had for good on their honeymoon and it‚Äôs told as a proud story when it‚Äôs disgusting. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have zero pity for her as she is absolutely disgusting herself.
Edit: words"
41,Hail Satan!
42,I‚Äôm just happy this man won‚Äôt ever get a partner with this mindset
43,"My mom has a master's, my dad has an HS diploma. Happiest couple you'll ever see. But then again, he's also not a piece of shit so...."
44,She had me in the first half. I'm not gonna lie.
45,"And that's how they get out of bad marriages, while you are stuck."
46,I don't understand people like this. Do you really want to be in a long-term relationship with someone that stays with you only because they have no other options?
47,"It's almost like some of us don't need to rely on anyone to feel fulfilled and economically independent?
What a shocking revelation!, I'll allert the Nobel prize authority, this person needs the award in economics"
48,"Someone got rejected by his college-educated ""friend"""
49,Giga virgins complain about women doing normal shit like getting an education. Upset that women are smart enough to know what a shitty man looks like
50,"We already know her account's name, no need to censor."
51,"Need is ‚Äúglue‚Äù - Saying the quiet part out loud again, are we?"
52,"They are worried about Satan's plans for woman, what's about women's plan for Satan?"
53,You blurred the name but we all know who this is let‚Äôs be honest
54,This is the Transform Wife I can already tell.
55,r/selfawarewolves
56,"It's a sound argument. Look, it even uses the word ""thus."" /s"
57,As a man who is college educated and has been financially dependent on his also college educated wife and is currently separated this is bullshit.  Any one should be able to leave an unhealthy or abusive relationship.  Or even one that is simply unhappy.  The fact that my wifi and I are now able to financially support our selves allowed us to separate. And while I don't think that is a fix for the marriage it has allowed us to go through this while being supportive of each other and our kids.   Being dependant breeds resentment and ruins marriages.
58,But who will open their jars for them?
59,"I mean, they're not even trying to hide that they take issue strictly with women having autonomy or choice in itself.

Edit for pronoun"
60,Abuse club (religion) doing what they do best. Pushing for their victims to be as powerless as possible.
61,"Of course! That explains why my wife is divorcing me in May when she gets her doctorate! /s 

In all honesty though, I'm pretty excited to have a dual income household. Money can be glue too!"
62,"Well looking at Lori's past tweet history, she believes that love is conditional and that we shouldn't depend on emotions, especially for marriage. It's quite sad and gross."
63,"I'm half convinced Lori is just playing 4D chess and using reverse psychology to drive people away from fundamentalism. 

At least, I can't imagine anyone with a functioning brain looking at her posts and thinking ""Yup, this is convincing, I will live my life like this now""."
64,The Christian groups are envious. Wait till those incels get what they want with SCOTUS. You‚Äôll truly understand gawd.
65,"Sounds like Satan is better for women than God, then."
66,"Yep, goes back to Eve"
67,Everything they say makes Satan look better. üòé
68,"The older you get, the more you know about yourself and what you want in life and a partner. What the fuck does a teenager or someone in their early 20s know about themselves or life?"
69,College educated couples have a responsible number of children. They want women to pop out 5+ babies for the church.
70,Yep no need to cover up her info.
71,It's not originally mine
72,Or maybe it's the husband pretending to be his wife to tweet out this stuff.
73,It's not originally mine
74,I didn't blur it myself. The screenshot isn't mine originally
75,"I found [this post](/r/SelfAwarewolves/comments/wicu15/not_really_sure_if_this_fits_or_not_but_i_think/) in r/selfawarewolves with the same content as the current post.

76,"Been there,done that"
77,"Hence the reality that the religious overwhelmingly are rabidly antichoice even in cases of incest, rape or the health of the woman. Gotta make sure women know they have no rights and are lesser then a man's seed and he is the one who gets to decide who his kids mother is going to be if she wants to or not"
78,Too many people don't have functioning brains and that's how we ended up in this situation.
79,"I know you're using incel in the colloquial sense, but the amount of 100% unironic, self-identified incels who have taken the ""God pill"" is truly terrifying. It's extremely obvious from the way they talk about it that their hatred and the hatred that birthed religion as we know it today are one and the same. 

It's all a mix of power lust, literal lust, shame, ego, a pathological need for control, misplaced anger, and material self-interest. Always has been."
80,"He (or she) seems pretty cool tbh,more tolerant than ""Christians"""
81,"Okey, okei."
82,"That‚Äôs not true, religious EXTREMISTS are rabidly anti choice.  I ain‚Äôt Christian by any stretch of the imagination but I know plenty of them who are good people and aghast at the current choices of our government.  The decisions of the US Supreme Court don‚Äôt reflect the desires of the majority.  We live in a republic, not a democracy."
83,"If you have 1 bad cop and 9 good cops who just kinda let him do whatever, then what you actually have are 10 bad cops.

A bad apple spoils the bunch. If they're so aghast, the ball is in their court to, I dunno, do something about it I guess."
84,"And yet the overwhelming majority of christians voted for trump and the gop and continue to vote for them all while trying to eat their cake and eat it too by saying ""but we don't agree with them"" 

Yeah no, that convenient excuse no longer flies"
85,"Exactly, so tired of that convenient excuse as well as their other one that they are ""not real christians"""
86,"Yeah, yeah, ACAB and all that, I‚Äôm an anarchist myself.  I don‚Äôt think that comparison holds much water here.  A cop is someone who specifically seeks out a position of brutal physical and legal power over others.  Most Christians are working class people who are just as victimized by the system as everyone else.  It‚Äôs hard to be politically literate when you have to work 2 jobs to support your family. 

The responsibility to ‚Äúdo something about it‚Äù is EVERYONES.  We should all be doing everything in our power to build strong communities and build a new way of life independent of hierarchy.   Throwing stones, talking trash and generalizing people I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have much exposure to isn‚Äôt part of that."
87,"In my experience they‚Äôre usually ignorant, not evil.  They just get sucked in by sound bytes that sound good to them, that‚Äôs why the GOP uses easy to digest and emotionally charged catchphrases to lure in voters.  They‚Äôre catering to people who don‚Äôt understand politics, which is a tragedy of the working class; the people getting fucked are trapped in a cycle of ignorance and poverty because they don‚Äôt have the time or energy to dedicate to learning or furthering themselves."
88,">generalizing people I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have much exposure to

Just nearly every member of my family, nearly every professional contact I've ever had, and about 50% of all the friends I've ever had. I guess I probably should make a point to meet more Christians."
89,"I'd wager that it has been exposure to the average Christian that has everyone ""throwing stones"" though. You can only be around so many people that think you are going to hell for x reason or another before you start to dislike them as a whole. So you will have to forgive people treating them like spoiled children, at least until they start behaving like adults that don't feel the need to type/say ""not all christians"" in response to every minor criticism of their belief."
90,"Yeah no, the evidence is right in their face, the gop and trump literally says what they are going to do to hurt women, minorities, gay people, children etc etc and they cheer it on.

It is willful deliberate evil and their mealy-mouthed excuses that they ""didn't know"" when confronted with the consequences of their deliberate actions because they dont want to suffer any consequences for being nasty a\*\*holes, not good enough, shun, blame, and paint them with the scarlet letter of their evil

Done being nice"
91,"Has anything gotten better under a Democratic president?  The people in office right now are still increasing funding for the police and haven‚Äôt done shit to actually protect the causes they claim to care about.  Biden could do something about abortion and he just DOESNT.  AOC is a traitor.  I don‚Äôt think anyone who voted for him can claim moral superiority.  If you believe in upholding the status quo and doing anything short of obliterating capitalism, you‚Äôre still engaging in state violence."
92,"Wow, you literally defending trump voters and the gop and claiming they are the same as democrats. there simply is not any shred of reality or fact to cure that sort of nasty hateful entitled deliberate enjoyment of evil"
