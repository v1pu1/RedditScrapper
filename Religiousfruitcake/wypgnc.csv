1,"Well if the spouses really own each other’s bodies, can’t the woman direct the man’s body to leave her alone?"
2,Seems like someone's in the doghouse.
3,I'm not justifying thing I just endorsed
4,Saying “but I’m not justifying marital rape!” doesn’t cleanse the fact that you are *literally justifying marital rape.*
5,"Huh, so that means I can kill my husband and then feed him to the pigs. That's what I'd do to a human if I owned them."
6,Fuck off. Pray tell wtf are you going to do of you can't have sex because your partner develops a medical condition that makes it impossible?
7,I had to change the wording of the post cuz I cant use the letter R
8,I'm pretty sure weaponizing sex literally means rape
9,"Hey honey, can you take a piss for me? Not feeling up to walking all the way over there atm."
10,"***""In marriage your body doesn't belong to you anymore. It is your spouse's""***   
Oh! Ok so that means my husband's body will be mine too? Cool! I will make sure to fuck his ass everyday with the largest strapon in existence. His body is mine right? He has no say over it so I will do whatever the fuck I want with it!"
11,I hate this “argument” cause soon as you flip it back on men it’s suddenly “women have to be submissive to men and not tell them what to do!” They pretend it’s equal but it’s so obviously not.
12,"In marriage, you both share your bodies, but they don't turn necessarily into objects that you decide when it's time to use it

If the wife doesn't wanna make sex, just respect it

If the husband doesn't wanna make sex, just respect it too

It's not that hard to understand"
13,"I mean, that's at the end of their usefulness though, right? Because there's probably other things that I would have a human do before killing them. For instance - my dryer is broken."
14,"Dear hubby, cause your body is mine I decided to buy that nice tiny peen cage for you. Say goodbye to your little friend you won't see him in a while."
15,I can repair my own dryers. ;)
16,"Well, La Di Dah, Look at Ms. FANCY who has pigs and can fix dryers."
17,"Thus why I'm not married. Now, if I owned the person I married, there would be incentive to get a husband. :P"
