1,Who is saying ‚Äúlove is love‚Äù for pedophiles ü§Æ
2,"hmm

yes

the floor here is made out of jesus"
3,"Well if god defined marriage as a thing between a man and a woman, why did he gave us the ability to love the same gender?"
4,"At my public junior high school (this was grade 9), our English teacher asked the class for synonyms for ""love"".  Several kids called out suggestions.  I put my hand up and said ""adore"".  The teacher said this was wrong because ""adore"" meant only love of God (or some shit like that. It was a long time ago).  So I said, ""but it's still love, right?""  I got ignored and after class he called me up and asked me if I believed in god.   I told him ""no"" and he shook his head.  What the fuck wasche even asking that shit for?  This was a public school!"
5,"For gay marriage, people that weren't ignorant bigots said ""Love is love"".

For pedophilia, the only people saying ""Love is love"" are pedophiles.

It's a subtle, yet distinct difference, you plank."
6,"Nobody is saying that about pedophilia. Let's get that one sorted out right now.

And which version of what God says love is? Because the Bible has some kings who were beloved by God and had several wives and concubines. Did the all-knowing, unchanging God change his mind somewhere along the way?"
7,"Man and man technically, as eve was supposed to be his rib."
8,they should let the catholic priests know all that and tell them to stop abusing boys.
9,"For subjugation and opression they said its gods' descision.

For pedophilia in church they said its gods' descision and fault of the victim.

For hate speech they said its gods' word.

For love they will say its satans' work and doing,"
10,"Are we going to just forget all god's chosen leaders having tons of concubines? Think that's a lot more than one on one. Then again trinitarians believe 3=1, so I guess it'd be about a third."
11,"I'm confused by all of those guys equalling gay rights to peadophilia, I thought peadophilia was a catholic tradition"
12,no one ever said that pedophilia is love if not the actual pedophiles themselves... what is this degenerated christian woman talking about
13,How stupid do you have to be to think anyone (left/democrats) are pro pedophilia?‚Ä¶I have an aunt and uncle that believe this and I think it‚Äôs a more broadly held belief than we‚Äôd like to think
14,Bitch; who said pedophilia was ‚Äúlove is love‚Äù?
15,"The last sentence is incomplete

Shouldn't it be one man and one woman plus hundreds of concubines."
16,"God also said don‚Äôt eat shellfish Karen, but you at Red Lobster twice a week."
17,"The bible: gay marriage is a sin

Also the bible: doin‚Äô it in the butt doesn‚Äôt count, you‚Äôre still a virgin"
18,The people who saylove is love to support gay marriage are not the ones saying it to support pedophilia....thats priests.
19,"This argument is a red herring. It‚Äôs a distraction. It doesn‚Äôt matter. 

This is all based on a theological belief and if that is the theology that someone accepts as truth, that‚Äôs great, but not everyone believes that. 

Forcing theological beliefs onto others is literally part of the definition of religious persecution (look it up)."
20,No he didn‚Äôt people did. The Bible is the worlds longest game of telephone. Also who tf said love is love about pedos
21,Perps aside....who the *everloving fuck* says pedophilia is love?!
22,Someone needs to brush up on their Bible knowledge. Perhaps Betty Bowers could help her
23,"""For pedophilia they're saying...""

No, no they are not.

""Thou shalt not lie, bitch."" --God."
24,"""God""'s definition of ""marriage"" is actually a lot more flexible:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkeKKszXTw"
25,"One man and one woman sound more pedophilic than love is love.

You aren't really specifying an age limit with one man and one woman it sounds more like you care that it's just a man and a woman.

Also, Christians use to have child marriages as well. And if you know the story of Romeo and Juliet where Juliet was meant to marry a 25-year-old at 15. Back in Shakespeare's time, there was no age of consent laws so this was actually acceptable. And who are the people trying to promote traditional marriage?"
26,Tell that to the Catholic Church lmao
27,Remember the flood? Not that one. The one that killed all the egyptians for preventing their slave population to flee
28,"Yeah but then he also said incest, since adam and eve were ""breeding""? Like, otherwise that would not have happened? or am I missing something here? I mean, he also said rape in case of Deuteronomy 22:28‚Äì29 aka saying it's ok if he pays for and marries the victim, so there's that..."
29,[Have a video defining biblical marriage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkeKKszXTw)
30,so the all powerful and all knowing God that chooses to let millions of people suffer and die every year defines what love is? i‚Äôd sure love to hear his definition cause it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs the same as mine.
31,‚ÄúLove your fellow man NOT LIKE THAT!‚Äù
32,The only pedos I know that are openly being supported is the Catholic Church
33,I think god was okay with slamming children though so love is love in this case.
34,Funny how their argument against pedophilia doesnt argue against pedophilia. One man one girl still fits their barbaric definiition. Even in their argument they cant even define mariage as an adult agreement.
35,"I mean, if they cared maybe they would be advocating for a federal minimum age of 18 to get married at in the US. And yet I think Ive seen one religion in common for most US politicians who vote down raising the minimum age to marry....

Oh and why arent they also fighting for children to be able to divorce thier own spouse? Last I checked the parents who search around for a judge to approve thier childs wedding dont tend to sign off on divorce papers..."
36,Do these people ever get tired of blatantly lying all the time for their religion? You'd think they'd get tired of it after a while from the cognitive dissonance.
37,Except Adam and eve. They weren't married. But hey! Crack on.
38,Also god is a HE for some reason and women are just ok with that and all the misogyny in the Bible.
39,Only the religous justify love is love for pedophiles. I dont see any atheist organizations like the freedom from religon foundation paying the lawyer fees for pedophile priests. Then sending them to other churches to repeat the cycle.
40,"Pretty sure humans define what marriage is (and love for that matter), but if God wants to give me a call from the offices of whatever dictionary he works for I'll recant that statement."
41,"Ah the old ""gays are pedos"" argument. Some classics never die. Even when they most definitely should be rotting in the ground."
42,"Sometimes I'm glad that I'm neurodivergent so I can just say ""Nah"" to societal pressure."
43,"If we followed Gods idea of marriage, i would have 700 wives and 800 hoes."
44,Oooh unless you‚Äôre Mormon. Then god defines love between 1 man and dozens of women. ;)
45,"There's a lot of hate going out to pedophiles but nobody taking about the pedophilephiles.

These people who find pedophiles sexually attractive have got to stop. They're normalizing pedophilia."
46,"Yeah, but I don't believe in god, so this doesn't apply to me.  If you want self impose ridiculous constraint on yourself, have it and enjoy, but leave me and my friends out of your masochism."
47,"God doesn‚Äôt allow someone to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù, so the concept of a ‚Äúfree country‚Äù is completely foreign to these fundamentalists‚Ä¶"
48,Love is love as long as it's between consenting living adult humans.
49,Why did he make them gay then?
50,God is love. So their god is nothing more than a human emotion. Which makes sense why there is no consistent definition of both god and love. It's all relative to an individual's emotions. They really do show gods are made in the image of men.
51,"Literally noone is saying love is love for pedophiles, I'll shoot them alongside any fascist, mainly because their venn diagram is almost a circle, but even the ones who aren't."
52,"Lmao don‚Äôt care what god says 

I didn‚Äôt vote for him"
53,"I despise it when people speak in tautologies. The sentence x = x contains no useful info.

But this lady has taken it one step further. She has concluded that x ‚â† x. How in the fuck."
54,"Excuse me who the actual fuck is using love is love for pedophiles we already have told them numerous times they are NOT welcome in the community and this would just make more ammunition for queerphobes to use in the
 pedo bad = gay bad argument"
55,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHold on just a sec there‚Ä¶uh-huh‚Ä¶oh really? Yeah, I just checked with God, and he says you *do* love me. Just like I thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn, I guess you got me there.‚Äù"
56,"No... 'they' are not saying about pedophilia that ""love is love""... Except maybe that Republican senator that thinks it's ok to marry 14 year olds."
57,"One man, one woman, a concubine, his brother's widow, and sprinkle some slave of indeterminate age. That's a biblically valid mariage"
58,"""lemme imply gay marriage and pedophilia are equally worse so that people buy into my bigoted agenda"""
59,Does someone want to tell them about the altar boys?
60,"I once saw someone say that ‚Äòlove‚Äô in the Bible translates more closely to ‚Äòself sacrifice‚Äô
Yeah, Jessica, you‚Äôre definitely sacrificing yourself to love your man-child husband who plays Valorant all night"
61,"So marriage is between a man, a woman and a hundred sex slaves then?"
62,"God also doesn't have a problem with killing babies, he's quite well known for it in fact...

Your move."
63,Bit of a sick Joke a priest calling gay people pedophiles
64,"Pedophilia may not be a sexuality or kink that one can help having (there are debates about where sexual desires and orientations arise from), but it is absolutely one that should not include acting on one‚Äôs desires. Also, there have been many cases where people attracted to children have sought out help and been denied by psychiatric professionals out of liability concerns. Pedophilia should NEVER be considered part of a healthy sexuality, and I doubt very much that anyone is saying ‚Äúlove is love,‚Äù about adult/child sexual relationships beyond offending pedophiles, themselves. I think that society is, at least in part, responsible for the monsters it creates, whether it‚Äôs biologically or socially. Including these ultra Christian societies who seem to churn them out a fairly high rates. Take responsibility for your own house, Chloe."
65,Do tell me where in the Bible it says marriage between 1 man and 1 woman? Cause everywhere I look it seems to be 1 man and however many women that man wants.
66,God is love and he defines love and he also defines the love between the children and his priests
67,"I can accept it, god does determines what love is. So, when is he coming to teach us? Like, Himself, multiplying things and you know, opening the sea? When something with the bright of a star, the power to change the laws of physics comes to teach me, I will gladly obey."
68,Their God isn‚Äôt love. Their God is selfish. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWorship me or go to hell‚Äù
69,"For evangelical pastors they said
""love is love‚Äù.

Weird how so many pastors get caught out kiddy fiddling, abusing their congregation, stealing from their church, and sleeping around. 

Such hypocritical crap."
70,No hate like xian love.
71,"No one is saying that for pedophilia‚Ä¶. 

‚ÄúLove is not love‚Äù second most moronic statement I‚Äôve read today. 

‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù third most moronic statement I‚Äôve read today.  

All three have come from America, my homeland. Usually there‚Äôs a Russian in there somewhere."
72,How does she know what people are saying about pedophiles?
73,[removed]
74,So if love is without god it's what then?
75,"Imagine thinking ""love is not love"" is a sane thing to say and think"
76,"Sorry but i dont take serious people who use ""woke"" unironicaly"
77,Search Chloe Nicole on Pornhub. You will ‚Äúlove is love‚Äù the results
78,So pedophilia is god? Church thinks so
79,"That person missed a single important fact, gays don't hurt anyone, while pedophiles hurt children."
80,"Person thinks she is ‚Äúgod‚Äù with final say on everything she sees.

This is what ‚Äúgod‚Äù is to a fundamentalist. 

‚ÄúI‚Äù am ‚Äúgod‚Äù.

Now everyone must clap!"
81,Love in all caps is not love in lower case letters?
82,"Pedophilia is ""Love is Love"" ... ??? wtf"
83,"fascists call people racist too, doesn't make them right"
84,So gods not real therefore god defines nothing
85,So fucking persecuted smh
86,Nope. Nope on the pedophilia. Liar.
87,"My Little Red Book **is** godlike, I'll give you that. But I never trust anyone with two first names anyhow .../s."
88,"No one is saying that except for the pedos. 

Can‚Äôt these people go crawl back under their rock?"
89,"I would love for them to point to where these pedophiles masquerading as gay people actually are, and I would love to know why the rest of us have to be punished for their existence"
90,"Your god appoints a lot of pedophiles.. you would rather a priest LOVE your son, than a man you don‚Äôt know love a man you don‚Äôt know?"
91,It's such a wild coincidence that all of God's wishes fall right in line with your ideology!
92,"Me to her: I mean, the dictionaries say otherwise. :D"
93,"""GOD"" made Mary pregnant when she was a teenager according to the holy book of fables. With that, wouldn't ""GOD"" be a pedophile then and threfore not able to define what love is since pedophilia is not love like homosexuality is? Is ""GOD"" and his pedophilia an exception to the rule?"
94,"Pedophiles.


That‚Äôs it, nobody else says that."
95,Yeah that's fucking off.
96,"Church priest defenders and rape of children in church deniers, probably."
97,Catholic priests and Muhammed (piss be upon him) perhaps?
98,christians themselves since that's what their church is all about anyways
99,Republicans
100,Republicans in states like Texas where it's legal to marry a 14 yo as a adult if the parents give permission.
