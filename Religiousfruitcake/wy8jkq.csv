1,what having no sex ed does to people
2,"I'd love to believe that this was satire, but... probably not. What I want doesn't matter though. What matters is where the evidence leads and in this case, it points towards rape and not a fucking miracle. 

How could anyone ever suggest to turn a blind eye to this? Like, how strong is your desire for validation that you'd be willing to disregard the facts just to comfort yourself?"
3,"""Perhaps she had a dream of having a sexual encounter with her husband that her body thought it was real enough to produce a pregnancy"" 

Grow up. Did the rapist post this ridiculous suggestion?"
4,"Poor woman, I don‚Äôt know what her chances look like as far as recovery, but can you imagine waking up from a coma and finding out you have a BABY because you got raped by the janitor or something"
5,or perhaps...  she got raped.
6,I think we know who to start that round of DNA testing on...
7,Found the rapist‚Ä¶
8,"A crime was committed but let‚Äôs pretend it was a miracle and not look for any evidence.

Hopefully this person will never serve on jury duty."
9,Definitely posted by a Christian fundie.
10,">Or is man too intelligent to believe

r/SelfAwarewolves"
11,or perhaps..... you don't understand simple fucking biology.
12,"Not sure if an excellent troll or just yet another rapey Christian.

Probably a rapey Christian though."
13,Why are Christians so pro rape?
14,https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/wy36js/immaculate_conception/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf link to original
15,"If they don't investigate something tells me there will be at least one more ""immaculate conception"""
16,Um. Was that comment perhaps written by a guy who works in that facility?
17,Totally not posted by the guy who knocked her up
18,"This is what happens when a 2000 year old book of scripture meets 21st century standards of evidence. 

Historically speaking, it it quite scary what people used to believe. Political leaders all around the world would mix divinity/holiness with their political actions, some elevating themselves to divine beings. Citizens would truly believe these claims because the world around them was explained with magic and religion in everything. 

It is hard to conceptualize how obvious some of these ridiculous lies from leaders and religious people are now with the scientific information and methods we have, but this scam by rich, powerful people worked very well for them."
19,I would DNA test red first.
20,This happened where I live a few years ago. It turned out to be a male nurse that was raping her. He claimed it was consensual although she is in a vegetative state. He went to prison. The family of the victim is raising the baby and have successfully sued.
21,I hate religious nut jobs more than racist. I swear I do. I know how to deal with a bigot. I have zero clue how to deal with a religious nut job. Most of the time I just stare at them in disbelief when they say stupid off the wall shit to me.
22,Sanest facebook user
23,I‚Ä¶I hate people‚Ä¶this makes me so depressed‚Ä¶
24,I used to work with the victim‚Äôs mom. She‚Äôs the kindest woman. This whole thing just makes me sick.
25,"There is a very, VERY good chance the rapist posted this. This person should absolutely be DNA tested."
26,Well test from any workers there 10 months ago
27,‚Ä¶Poe's law. This sounds a little more like an antitheist taking the piss out of theists.
28,‚ÄúLet‚Äôs receive it as a miracle like we have the virgin Mar-‚Äú shut your goofy ass up she was raped
29,That‚Äôs some kill bill shit right there.
30,People like this can vote
31,We need better sex education in this country.
32,"Day by day, I lose more of my faith in humanity"
33,"Did this person just admit Mary cheated or was raped and lied about it?

Some miracle"
34,Spoken like a true sexual predator.
35,"Tell me you shouldn't be left unsupervised around vulnerable people, without telling me you shouldn't be left unsupervised with vulnerable people."
36,"This is why we need STEM held in high tegard in our schools. America, we are dumb and getting dumber. Let‚Äôs try to change this."
37,"Men raping women, a tale as old as sexual biology and anatomy have ever existed."
38,"Ah yes, the woman who's been in a vegetative state since early childhood is dreaming about her husband. That has to be it."
39,"Honestly, what really concerns me is the fact that the entire facility seemed to either not notice or cover up a *comatose panient* getting pregnant. I very much hope APS made an extremely thorough investigation."
40,I did my clinical rotations there twice - one of my old classmates was the one who saw the patient going into labor and she had to help deliver the baby. No one there was prepared for that or even noticed the patient was pregnant. It's so sad and disgusting.
41,"For the sake of what's left of my mental stability, I'm going to just assume they are mocking crazy religious folks."
42,Someone want to explain to this dumb duck she was raped while in a coma?
43,I want to read the comments under hers. The ones absolutely ripping her to shreds.
44,Attitudes like this is how the church gets away with raping children.
45,Mmmmm dream sperm
46,virgin mary or kill Bill?
47,"If she just spontaneously got pregnant by no one's fault then there shouldn't be any issue doing a DNA test because it'll only be herself, right? üôÇ"
48,This is obvious satire.
49,Poe‚Äôs law?
50,"was going to ask why this person would want to skip a DNA test if they think it's a miracle, since tests would confirm that, but then I remembered that this is crazy nonsense"
51,"The ""virgin"" birth is one woman's cover story blown totally out of proportion. Using it to cover for a rapist is a bit of a stretch."
52,That‚Äôs what the mf who did it would say
53,Let's just pretend the whole miracle thing was completely true. Wouldn't a DNA test just further prove that?
54,"Oh no sweety, mankind has believed all sorts of shit, but this time it's just a lityle bit sus"
55,DNA test That guy
56,"> Or is man too intelligent to ever believe in something so extraordinary that new life somehow produced itself while this woman was in a coma

(Raises hand) I am.  I'm too intelligent to believe that."
57,That guy works there for sure.
58,"I don't understand their point of view, and I don't think I want to."
59,yah someone should probably check into the person who wrote that.  he's most likely the one who got her pregnant üòÇ
60,"I don't think DNA tests should be done, either. They would be a waste since the person who was obviously the rapist was considerate enough to post that below the story."

62,"This reminded me of a child who had experienced this exact thing. When I looked to see if it was real, I discovered how often this happens and I don't wish to dig anymore."

64,"Hang on, how did you crosspost from a banned sub?"
65,"If you ever come across a similar asshat against abortion, kindly ask them to adopt the ""baby"" themselves. 

If they cannot, mind their own business."
66,Long story short‚Ä¶a man was convicted of rape
67,Don't test miracles or you'll prove they don't exist.
68,That comment need to read a human anatomy textbook
69,Found the father...
70,The fuck???
71,They need to check that persons DNA first!
72,Can we just give a dna test to red poster? Bet they‚Äôre the rapist.
73,"Spontaneous parthenogenetic and androgenetic events occur in humans, but they result in tumours: the ovarian teratoma and the hydatidiform mole, respectively. [source ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987717302694)

In other words, humans cannot produce viable embryos asexually.  Unfortunately this doesn't stop the world from being populated by idiots."
74,"If it makes anyone feel better, the scumbag was already found, convicted, and sentenced."
75,Enter the sandman intensifies
76,"""or is man too intelligent...""
 
Yes."

82,I hate it here
83,"The thing is if it was a virgin birth somehow, flying in the face of all known science, the DNA test would show that too. If somehow for the first time recorded history human pathogenesis happened, the baby would be a genetic clone of the mother and whoever discovered it would be famous"
84,The person making the reply is either the rapist or someone who knows the rapist.
85,I'd be willing to concede that it's probably exactly that miraculous.
86,Duke Lacrosse all over again. You can't just force a person to get dna tests.
87,"If there's anyone there named Buck, check them first."
88,Instantly pictured the coma pt as Beatrix Kiddo in the opening scene of Kill Bill.
89,Test that persons dna first
90,This guy is suspect number 1
91,this person thinks the matrix was a documentary
92,I say that they investigate the queef who left that comment.
93,I think we‚Äôve found the culprit.
94,Someone should drive over this guy with a heavy truck and then say ‚Äúit most of been god‚Äôs will to let it happen‚Äù.
95,I think they should test that person's DNA against coma babies...
96,Just how fucking stupid are some people?
97,Or perhaps some POS raped a poor Woman in a coma.  Which is the most likely scenario.
98,Doesn't extra  ordinary mean the opposite of extraordinary?
99,Posted by Bob the night nurse
100,Quick someone test this man!
