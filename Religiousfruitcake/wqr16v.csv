1,Nothing fails like end-of-world predictions. How many times has the world not going to end and their beliefs are wrong until people stop believing this crap?
2,"Mohammed has been saying that it's near and look... it's been 14 hundred years.

It's spinning like 1.4 milliseconds faster and following an article that I read it's temporary. (I'll try to find it)"
3,"Actually, Islam is a totalitarian ideology that controls everything from clipping your nails to how to manage a state and invade other countries or reach a peace treaty with them.

So leaving islam out of anything even mathematics is leaving Islam of itself.

Yeah you can't make that shit up."

5,The end of the world has been just around the corner dozens of not hundreds of times in the last few centuries alone.
6,So why is it spinner faster?
7,"Unlikely to ever happen. Someone will just say it was ""misinterpreted"" and give you a fresh date."
8,"End of the world theories dont even make sense

9,No one knows for sure but one leading theory has to do with ice and snow on mountains melting.
10,"True, but for the non-gullible among us, at least we can point and laugh."
