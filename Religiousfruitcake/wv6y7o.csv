1,"""Don't ever correct my wrong information again!"""
2,"Once again demonstrating that ignorance can be cured with knowledge, but stupidity remains an incurable terminal illness."
3,![gif](giphy|VVgRNcBKp64NO)
4,That’s all cool and stuff but don’t correct me !
5,Ten feet? Ten WHOLE feet??
6,Fun fact I don’t like facts!
7,The best way to prevent your fragile beliefs from being criticized is by keeping them to yourself.
8,I heard this shit growing up. Accepted it as gospel and never gave it a second thought. Completely forgot about it until reading this. And my parents wonder why I’m an atheist lol
9,TBH I am kind of disappointed they switched between kilometers and miles.
10,Especially since they start the post with “Fact”
11,The venn diagram of people who regurgitate incorrect “science” and those crying about being “censored” on facebook is a circle.
12,Dumb sh\*t doubling down demanding he gets to maintain his stupid so he can continue pretending there is a god.
13,Better not climb to the roof of your house! You might spontaneously combust!
14,"See , they make up their own science"
15,A thought occurred to me. If you don't want legit criticism of things you post. Maybe don't post them online for everyone to see. Especially if it's something that your way beyond wrong about. Then you won't get criticism . When you decide to post on a public forum you invite criticism regardless of whether you want it or not. So grow up and deal with it.
16,"I took an elevator to 8th floor, which is about 60ft high and I didn't burn up. I wonder why."
17,"While this level of ignorance is scary, it is promising that the correcting comment got more than three times as many likes as the original post."
18,What a baby lol
19,I've always thought that that is how they define 'facts'.
20,"What's funny is, even if that was the case, that doesn't mean ANYTHING. You could've said we were lucky instead of ""god did it."""
21,"""Don't make me look like an idiot""

""You don't need me to do that"""
22,Ignorance is their strongest weapon
23,"If the Earth was too close or too far away from the sun, then life wouldn't have arisen or survived here, and intelligent beings would have been having this discussion on another planet suitable for life instead."
24,"It's basically, ""fuck you for teaching me something factual over some bronze age craps I believe in."""
25,What a wyney POS
26,The correcting comment isn’t 100% true either. How could an earthquake knock earth out of the habitable zone by even ten feet? Doesn’t make any sense. Earthquakes are tiny vibrations on planetary scales not to mention that even an arbitrarily large earthquake couldn’t change the planet’s trajectory. You need an external force to affect an orbit it can’t come from the object itself without exhausting something like a rocket does
27,They didn't need to bring up the earthquake thing: if being 10ft closer to the sun would put you out of the habitable zone then you could kill yourself by climbing a ladder at noon
28,"If that were true, we'd all die if we went up a 10-foot hill."
29,"Humanity is doomed.

It's so sad that there are people in 2022 that don't know how seasons work."
30,"This is beyond stupid. 


She realizes the Earth rotates right? 


So every day her position to the sun changes a lot more than 10 ft."
31,how were people thought when we don't know much about solar system.
32,"This cannot be an actual conversation, can it?"
33,Love that she got ratiod
34,DONT POP MY BUBBLE!!
35,"Thank Gawd where I live happens to be at sea level! Also, measuring in feet on a celestial scale is fucking hilarious."
36,"But your religious post isn't even remotely true . 

""SHUT UP I DONT CARE ABOUT FACTS THATS DEMONIC"""
37,They are talking about space feet.
38,How did it get 2 likes?
39,Don't interrupt me spouting off nonsense to rile my ingroup!
40,Couldn't have said it better myself

42,"I feel like crying every time I see that piece of shit  


EDIT: For you people downvoting me, here's why...  
Watch some of his debates on youtube and look at his Twitter account...  
You'll see what I mean.   
Whenever someone has a good point, he doesn't let them speak, he will talk over them until they stop talking. He gets very angry when he's proven wrong.  
On Twitter sometimes he'll spew nonsensical rants about things like UFOs.  
He's a disgrace to science, he ignores the scientific method and acts like a typical religious person to boost his ego.  
Science is about discovery, not fame and selfishness."
43,"ten feet, a few million miles

it is all the same right?"
44,Yep. Better not walk up those stairs!!
45,Our orbit ranges millions of miles on over the year
46,Yeah imagine burning up because you climbed a ladder when it was noon.
47,"Its like that ""Dont tread on me"" meme but says ""Dont read to me"""
48,Same. It’s strange how blatant misinformation like this used to strengthen my faith when a quick google search is enough to disprove it
49,I like to think they purposely did it because Miss doublethink probably thinks Kilometer is a measurement of weight.
50,"""*Skiense*"""
51,"You're*

Sorry, I had to.."
52,^^
53,"Changing the center of mass could achieve this, i.e. Earth's center wouldn't move at all, and the trajectory would stay the same, so you don't need an external force.

Earthquakes depend on landmasses suddenly shifting, which does change COM, but you're right they're tiny at the given scale.

But of course, just... walking 10 ft could bring you closer or farther from the Sun. It's ludicrously short."
54,Looks like I'll be burning up soon (i have to go upstairs in a few minutes)
55,"Seasons don't happen because of Earth's elliptical orbit.

Seasons happen because the axis of rotation of Earth is tilted relative to the sun. When it's winter in the northern hemisphere it's summer in the southern hemisphere."
56,"You can like your own comments, and then maybe their mom added a like."
57,"This has to be curated, right? How are the random gifs always appropriate to the topic of the first gif?"
58,"lol, why?"
59,"Seriously, WHY?"
60,"He stated an (do agree on that part) insensitive fact. It remains to be a fact. You hating him on that is just showing that you are immature. And what he said wasn't wrong, Gun Violence is bad, but the other causes of death are just as bad, if not even worse."
61,"I live on the second floor, what do I do?!"
62,So not ten feet? I’m shocked by this revelation!
63,*Yro'ue
64,"But the center of mass, wherever it now lays will always stay on its current orbit, overall there will be no translation"
65,Jokes on you my mom isn’t support of me.
66,Or they have two Facebook profiles.
67,"He's a stuck up jerk, fame ruined him. He views anyone with differing opinions inferior and like trash."

70,"you don't even know why I hate him... stop making assumptions.

71,"Climb on the outside walls like Spiderman, presumably."
72,[Allow me to illustrate](https://i.imgur.com/nzEg3Go.png)
73,Ok didn’t know and never heard about that
74,"Who cares if he is stuck up?  I'm not a fan of him for his sparkling personality, I care about his contributions.  Imagine getting upset because a scientist is ""stuck up"", or they let the ""fame get to them"".  Like, good.  I'm glad he's stuck up.  Tons of people walk around with an undeserved inflated sense of self, nevermind one of our most well known scientists.  Why not cry about that."
75,"Unhelpful, insensitive tweet. Meh"
76,Thank god for spider people.

79,Average twitter user
80,isnt that just every tweet though
81,"Okay.. okay, I looked at his [Twitter](https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/5dmkgz/neil-degrasse-tysons-tweets-are-so-bad-and-he-needs-to-go-away) and yeah, he's more of a troll than I realized (where the heck did that comment about painful sex come from?!) And yeah, my opinion of him is definitely brought down a peg, but I mean... (Edit. Oops, hit send without meaning to) ... we had a president of the United States who said and did far worse. My threshold for celebrities that act like idiots and upset me is very very high these days.  Is it the behavior I'd hope from a famous astrophysicist? Nope.  Does it make me like him less? A little, yeah.  Am I going to avoid his programming if I catch it on TV?  Honestly, probably not.  

But yeah, I see your point. I personally don't think it's worth getting upset over or actively boycotting him, but I get why someone would dislike him."
