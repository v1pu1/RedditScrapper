1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,Make the Inquisition Great Again?
2,Once again the line between religion and psychosis gets smeared. How is thinking like this not symptomatic of some sort of mental illness?
3,"Here's one of the biggest problems with religion: when a figure of authority in a religion says something, claiming it came from God or whatever, followers have to accept it. Even if it would otherwise go against their morals, or would be disgusting to them, they must twist their minds to accept it in this case. Anything ordered by God or his mouthpieces automatically becomes moral. Which is why so many people can be convinced to commit atrocities. 

This person might truly believe that non catholics should be burned. They might not have believed it before this quite was shown to them. But they have to double down. Or else their entire religion can be questioned."
4,"There probably are other religions that feel the same, if you don't believe their ""god"", you'll be burned or killed in some way. I guess no matter which belief you maintain, you'll just be burned to death regardless."

7,The pope's quote isn't actually a quote and is taken from a paragraph about the Albigensian Crusade in Tompkins'Â The Magic of ObelisksÂ (1981).

11,I would say their actual actions were proof enough that they would definitely burn people for such nonsense.
