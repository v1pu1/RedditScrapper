1,Fittest refers to those living organisms that are most successful at reproducing. They are best adapted to their environment.
2,Who thinks Darwin's theory was a proposal?  How is anyone this ignorant in today's world when they are in front of a keyboard with the ability to read just about anything they choose?
3,"Is that why both the Soviet Union and NAZI Germany discredited evolutionary biology in favour of their own pseudoscientific ideas? 

Hitler was a creationist, he was quite clear about that. And Stalin favoured Lysenkoism. An equally crazy idea. Also pretending Marxism and fascism are compatible is adorable."
4,"One day they'll learn that ""fit"" isn't a synonym of ""strength""."
5,I would think its the relogions that tell the followeres that there are categorily better and worse groups of people. That probably had 150%more to do with it.
6,"So, evolution is causing Christofascism. Who knew?"
7,"Evolutionary theory is a description, not a prescription. This is like accusing meteorologists of saying that it's morally good to destroy people's homes because they study hurricanes."
8,"Totally accurate. 

Marxism was definitely inspired by a book published 11 yrs **after** The Manifesto of the Communist Party, because thats how time works ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
9,Why should we feel responsible for anything if it doesn't exist?   This is backwards thinking.
10,"I'd say the number of wars fought in the name of religion, and today's extremist christian fervor contributed a lot simply by setting a bad example for others."
11,Tell me you don‚Äôt understand the meaning of the phrase: ‚Äú Survival of the fittest.‚Äù Without telling me you don‚Äôt understand the meaning of the phrase: ‚ÄúSurvival of the fittest!!!!
12,"""Survival of the fittest,"" is literally the definition of capitalism.   This guy is an idiot."
13,Then whats the excuse for the catholic church sucking up to every faciast dictator in the christian world?
14,As a Darwinist I am offended
15,"I'm sorry doesn't their fucking book center around a ""chosen people"" ?

A chosen people who then committed ethnic genocide in the name of their god, because they claimed he promised them land that was already occupied?

Then once these ""chosen people"" stole the land from the original occupants that were there first, they refer to everyone else outside of their community as gentiles? 

You know the ""evil uncircumcised others"" that they claimed their god said they could take captives from and enslave for life. Or do they not know what gentile means?

I assume the moron who wrote that doesn't realize the whole first two thirds of the bible are pro-fascist. 
The last third is a retro fitting the bullshit Messiah story mixed in with apocalyptic poetry and early religious schisms between Paul and Peter.


I had planned to write something completely different while reading this guy's post. Then I saw the hashtag at the bottom. my comment is relevant to that hijacked #. Everyone else thoroughly addressed everything above that."
16,"""Survival of the fittest"" isn't quite so literal as ""only the strongest survive"" - it's in refrence to adaptation, specifically, how desirable traits in a species that ""fit"" their environment are passed on genetically. Organisms who survive long enough to pass on their genes are ones whose traits best ""fit"" their environment - Darwin wasn't talking about individuals being the very best and beating all the competition, he was talking about the very slow evolutionary process of species developing genetic traits that suit their survival needs.

Humanity didn't make it this far by being physically dominating species, but by forming mutually benefical social collectives."
17,"That's not what survival of the fittest means and Darwin is not to blame for (primarily) the right misinterpreting what his phrase means. 

And Stalin didn't even believe in genes? Wdym Marxism?"
18,"Yes, how do you know I get my political and historical knowledge from Facebook memes?

-that person"
19,"1) the heck does any of that have to do with Marxism? To each according to their need is the opposite.

2) many people tried to apply ""social darwinism"" and have been condemned for years. Evolution is the theory of how organisms evolve. It is not a concept regarding societies and political systems."
20,"Meanwhile, the actual source material for nazism was Martin Luther's writings. Projection, as always."
21,I propose that fairies and unicorns conspired to give us the herpes virus.
22,Ah yes because it's not like the bible was ever used to justify slavery or anything. No sir. It's the scientific theory that explains how skin colour came about by completely natural processes that causes racism.
23,"Is it just me, or do a lot of these cringe apologists have creepily happy profile pics? Like this much stupidity should not be symbolized by such an unreasonably happy smiley face."
24,I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. Have sat during sermons where the pastor blames racism on Darwin and those that believe in evolution.
25,"Bold talk from a religious person, to blame death and suffering on atheism. Last I checked, most religions could have millions of bodies laid directly at their feet, and countless years of suffering for countless millions more. And last I checked, atheism has a body count of zero. Not that no atheist has killed or caused harm. But none have done it en mass for the sake of atheism. Athesim doesn't get people together to hate on entire other groups of people. Only religion does that."
26,"Yes, nazis do actually misinterpret this purposefully to support their narratives. But I have yet to find a single marxist who uses this statement for their hate against certain groups of people.

Also, why the # ? I'm so confused."
27,"Marxism isn‚Äôt really fascism, instead authoritarian socialism. But pretty much what this idiot is trying to say."
28,Trying to sound intelligent is pretty difficult when you're an idiot.
29,"Sometimes you see so many inaccuracies you just open your mouth, let out a small defeated noise and then close it"
30,No greedy horrible people are responsible for fascism same people who bring you church‚Äôs
31,"These are the same people who scream about the ""free market"" and imply survival of the fittest and apathy is a capitalist ideal"
32,"Mutual aid is also a factor of evolution, and not just ruthless competition, Mutual aid is the backbone of anarchism.

Survival of the fittest was used by totalitarians and robber barrons to justify their plundering of the poor, and they had been doing it before Darwin‚Äôs theory had been conceived."
33,Before Darwin we had peace on earth
34,"* ""Survival of the fittest"" was coined by Herbert Spencer, not Darwin.

* On The Origin Of Species was published in 1859. The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848.

* Fascists were definitely inspired by Social Darwinism, but scientific racism predates Origin Of Species by over 200 years so blaming Darwin for that is silly."
35,Technically... Evolution on Earth did result in one particular variant of life that uses fascism quite a bit
36,"That's some mental gymnastics if I ever saw an example of that. How do you get from ""being the best at breeding and making sure your genes go on in the future"" to fascism?
Fuck religious people are just becoming more stupid by the minute."
37,"It was actually Herbert Spencer that posited ""survival of the fittest"""
38,"Survival of the fittest also is incorrectly attributed to Darwin when it was Herbert Spencer who coined the term to describe his views on capitalism and the economy. Darwin would write his Origin of Species eight years later where he would quote the term ""Survival of the fittest."""
39,"To be completely fair, if evolution did not happen, we would all still be singe celled microorganisms floating in the sea. Not some arrogant apes making up crazy ideologies or religions and whatnot. So yeah, down with monkeys"
40,"Makes perfect sense. When Darwin first visited the Galapagos he noted that the various bird species were in the middle of a proletariat revolt against a select few of their bird oligarchs. By them time he left, the Marxist birds had established a fascist communist dictatorship, as birds are wont to do."
41,"Let's see, the Soviets rejected Darwin in favor of Lysenko, and Hitler banned Darwin's books because he believed it was impossible for humans to be related to other primates, but sure, let's blame evolution for Marxism and fascism."
42,"Actually I always thought of evolution and natural selection as more akin to capitalism while us grouping together and helping each other out (sharing resources) was more socialist. The very idea of helping the week is spitting in the face of natural selection and I am ok with that. We are humans, we are better than our nature."
43,Darwin never used the term survival of the fittest. Evolution is actually the process of traits that became dominant because they were best suited for survival.
44,"Isn't ""survival of the fittest"" quite a capitalist idea? The company who is most fit in the market is the one that survives while the other ones get out competed and go bankrupt (i.e. extinct)."
45,Bundling Marxism and fascism is already a pretty good red flag for the idiocracy
46,"Marxism is the opposite of survival of the fittest

This guy is talking out of his ass

He doesn‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs saying"
47,"I can see how survival of the fittest, misunderstood, could justify fascism, but marxism? I would have like them to develop on that one... let's push the craziness to the limit..."
48,"How many times do these dumbasses need to be told: a statement of fact can't prescribe how we behave. (You can't get an ""ought"" from an ""is"")"
49,**Laughs in markets producing the best outcomes** as capitalism slowly wipes out all the species on üåç
50,"I mean, the mental gymnastics are immeasurable but the logic is there, if humans never evolved we would never have committed all the atrocities that we have under our belts currently."
51,"Umm, if fascism is caused by the left's marxist agenda, why do we find so many Nat-Cs?"
52,"the theory of evolution was first published in 1859.

Karl marx wrote the communist manifesto in 1848"
53,Which is why we use natural selection. Less confusing to some.
54,"In reality Hitler was a Creationist, in his book he made that super clear and said Darwinian evolution was impossible. Plus Darwin's books were banned in Nazi Germany.

Oh Putin is not ""Godless"" either, he's a hardcore Christian. 

Why do these Christian Fascists always become ""Godless"" once they do terrible things?"
55,There‚Äôs no need to even try to reason with them.
56,I guess if you were to make the argument that [social darwinism ](https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/social-darwinism) led to nazis then there is some kind of connection there. But it's kind of like blaming cyber-bullying on Edison and Tesla
57,"Because even those which are ‚Äúfittest‚Äù in terms of having an adaptation that makes them more suited to an environment still can and do die.

The most adaptable tend to survive, and the most successful at reproducing drive evolution from that side of things"
58,Bold move assuming these mouth breathers can read
59,"Survival of the fittest is not the core of evolution, and fittest is often, and almost certainly in the case of this nut, misunderstood‚Ä¶"
60,"They're basically the flat-earthers of the 21st century.

... oh wait, we still have those idiots around too."
61,But for that they would need to actually read a biology text book
62,Eugenics moment
63,"True. Denying human nature, which developed during the process of evolution, is not going to change human nature. Religions are a result of evolution. They are mainly the result of the fear of death and desire for domination in own social group as well as domination over other social groups."
64,It all started when Darwin came across a blue police box....
65,Too often these people have a vested interest in confusing others.
66,He and the Russian Orthodox Church blame the death of Prince Alexie and Princess Anastasia on roving Jews. I shit you not.
67,"Here's the thing social Darwinism means that the best of them are the best at society- justified by their position in society.  The reality is as soon as ""social darwinism"" happens it shifts to artificial selection."
68,"It‚Äôs an attempt to make evolution about individuals, when it‚Äôs about species-level groups"
69,Propagandaaaaaaa...
70,Yeah I know. Social darwinism only makes an iota of sense if everyone starts with the same circumstances.
71,"It‚Äôs not even just that, fittest is often thought to be synonymous with strongest, when fittest can mean less strong in certain contexts‚Ä¶"
72,Indeed!
