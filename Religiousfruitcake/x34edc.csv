1,Sort of like Solomon. 700 wives and 300 sex slaves.
2,"Go figure, a rampant problem in the history of organized religion is pedophilia... And the founder of one of the most prominent religions on earth was in fact, a pedophile. Color me fucking shocked."
3,"There are many interesting things in their ""holy book"" about these kind of matters. One of them is about forbidding anyone from marrying Mohammad's wives after his death. I mean unless you write this as a human being in the name of an imaginary god who would include such a thing as a ""word of god""? 

Source: Al-Ahzab-53"
4,I genuinely don't understand Muslim women who argue that Islam is not a misogynistic religion when all they have to do is read their holy book and see what a mess this is.
5,"Muhammed had hundreds of sex slaves.

But also, women must cover themselves from head to toe because they might tempt men.

DA FUQ?

And yes, this is in the Quran as well as accompanying hadith. Now, if you do a quick google, you will find many Islamic websites and discussions which openly deny this fact. As with many Christians, Muslims like to claim that you're reading what it plainly says wrong. The words don't actually mean what they literally mean. Somehow, they actually mean the opposite."
6,"Ah, they really want everyone to idolise and respect the life of someone who literally owned sex slaves?"
7,"I wasn't aware of the last 10, but there is a fair amount of evidence that this is true according to Islamic primary sources. Refer to the Wikipedia articles for [Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_al-Qibtiyya) and [Rayhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayhana_bint_Zayd). Maria has the unique distinction of having bore Muhammed a son, Ibrahim, who died shortly after birth. In Islamic custom, a female slave is freed if she gives birth to her ""master's"" child."
8,Religion is a made up horror story to giving meaning after death and to cause terror and fear to those with different beliefs and ways of life
9,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry dudes Aisha wasn‚Äôt a sex slave, she was just a nine year old child in an arranged marriage with a highly powerful man who had sex with her. Just because Muhammad had other sex slaves doesn‚Äôt mean every child forced into a relationship with him was a sex slave, okay? Get it right.‚Äù"
10,"As well as dropping the text to an illiterate war mongering arse about how the universe was created and everything else, this god also sanctioned sex slaves? Sounds truly cosmic and not at all a crock of shit to allow middle eastern men to use women as pleasure toys and property - as long as they were useful."
11,Why they are calling him Prophet then ?!!?
12,"Ha, the well groomed ones were allowed to have there name recorded for history.  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Ok only 12 of you will be remembered in history.  So let the sex games begin."
13,The power of imagery. I cant see how anyone could defend these men as godly.
14,How dare you say the truth. We will be head you... right after I abuse this slave.
15,"If I was a sex slave, I would perform my job terribly, just lay there dead to the world, maybe they would transfer me to pyramid building or something if I'm a lousy lay"
16,"Muhammad was a good man! When he wasn't fucking children and raping sex slaves, he was writing down holy scripture and praying. Such a godly man PBUH"
17,The women look scared. I don't how someone can look past this stuff and think they're a good person
18,The guy that tweeted this got suspended from Twitter because of this tweet
19,Is Khalid Murad dead? Cause the religion of peace might share him with their gift for tell the truth. / s
20,"American Christians like to point to stuff like this as a way to justify that Christianity is the good religion. A better reaction would be to realize that both religions suck, and Islam just sucks marginally more"
21,"Yes, but it was a different time, back then.

/s"
22,All the riots that happened because someone mentioned their prophet marrying a child. Wonder how many more riots of someone quotes this guy. They seem to object when it‚Äôs someone who isn‚Äôt a Muslim saying it. Weird.
23,Cults will cult.
24,They are really not helping their argument at all. Imagine idolizing someone who had sex slaves and prepubecent wives. This dude looks as proud as a new parent about this shit...
25,Pale women and brown men??
26,"I bet they were all underage, too."
27,What a hero...
28,[removed]
29,"King David owned several as well, and when the prophet Nathan called him out, he jailed them all for life, because, you know, they should suffer, not him."
30,Two Maymunas? Talk about unoriginal names.
31,PBUH üôå
32,Which ones Mo in that drawing then?
33,"Abrahamic religions, on one hand, our guys fucked. One the other hand, you can't."
34,Just go read what prop-hate did to mariya kibtiya
35,what does Umm mean?
36,Lol well there's 11 names and one is a duplicate. Sounds like bible info to me üò∏ See virgins exhausted back then too. They wrote these bibles. Super frustrated they can't get none
37,"I couldn't find much information on these names. All sources seem to come from social media or non Muslim sources. 

Best not to use unverifiable meme type posts because it degrades the quality of this sub. 


(Just so people know, I am an agnostic)."
38,"To be fair, that was pretty common back then.

Dont get me wrong, slavery is bad. They just hadnt figured that out yet 2000 years ago.

Yes, he was wrong for having sex slaves....but everyone else back then did too. It was actually kinda expected if you were a man of..any...standing.

Again...slavery bad, but this was before we ALL agreed on that.

&#x200B;

*Now over to slavery in the Bible......*"
39,[deleted]
40,Sometimes it's hard to not hate men for all they did to us.
41,Source??? I dare you
42,It's he saying this is a good thing?
43,"Especially when they stem from the same base religion/ promise. 

Abraham was promised descendants that outnumbered the stars in the sky. He and his wife were worried as she was old and she said to take her servant and have a child by her and that‚Äôll be gods promised child. 
The servant Hagar gave birth to Ishmael not the promised son and Sarah hated her. 
Abraham‚Äôs wife Sarah later in really old age got pregnant and gave birth to the promised son Isaac who had 12 sons who became the 12 tribes of Israel. 

‚ÄúAnd as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year‚Äù(Genesis 17:20-21).

So Christianity came from Isaac and Islam came from Ishmael."
44,Proof where it's written down or else I call bs
45,Well I'm and this is totally fake
46,"Yes islam is bad , im gonna go fuck my friend because its ok üíÖüèª im smart cuz i dont belive in god , lets go queen ?"
47,Based
48,Hot
49,But he was so wise! /s
50,But I thought the bibble said marriage was between one man and one woman.
51,"I was watching a documentary last night about FLDS and I don‚Äôt understand how having that many wives does anything for you? The current ‚Äúprophet‚Äù of the FLDS has so many!! I can‚Äôt remeber the count but it was over 50 I think. Then he has his favourite.  Like what are you doing with all them? Do you just ignore half of them? A good chunk of them came from his dads set of wives after he died.  

Like what?! 


Thankfully he‚Äôs living his life in jail on counts of rape and helping people rape and underage marriages.  Yet he‚Äôs still running his ‚Äúchurch‚Äù from jail.  It‚Äôs wild."
52,The pie shall be cut in two‚Ä¶and the men to receive‚Ä¶DEATH! I shall eat the pie.
53,"Early islam is anything but organized though. It was one of the main problems the first khalifs faced. No unified scripture, no codified practices and a lot of heresy! And no single figure to guide (thus the fate of the first khalifs)

So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs religions period. You don‚Äôt need it to be organized."
54,"To everyone who says, ""but it occurs in all organizations, like sports clubs, schools etc"" well yeah, but the men of religion are supposed to be God's representatives on Earth. There is a higher level of trust than in secular organizations. And often the churches cover up the cases/perpetrators, because they have a holy image to protect. It's all kinda special to religion."
55,"That‚Äôs actually very interesting considering the practice of having multiple wives is said to be put in place as a way to support women after their breadwinner has passed away

Not in this case it seems lol"
56,There's also a verse saying people shouldn't overstay in Muhammad's house after a meal.
57,"This surprises me because many cultures often require a woman to marry after her husband dies, if only because that reflects badly on her socially if she doesn‚Äôt. It can be waved if she‚Äôs old, but if she‚Äôs young? She usually needs to be married for other practical concerns like not being able to work and this still needing income or something. If she‚Äôs not married, she‚Äôs under the guardianship of the next man on her life - like her brother or her husband‚Äôs brother until she is. Or she married _him_ instead. Very interesting."
58,"Probably something the FLDS would do, and the leader of that cult's also a human claiming to be God"
59,I mean in Islam you can't marry when you already have married when you're a woman so I see nothing of this as wrong
60,"It's because they cherry pick verses which give women rights/respect

Example:  beneath mothers feet lies paradise

women have shares in property from both their father and husband 

Women are not obligated to spend their money in a marriage.

Women receive money on their nikah(wedding day) as gift

These are just a few from top of my head,but the cons outweigh the pros significantly.
Islam is not a feminist religion AT ALL and i say this being from a muslim household.

The objectification and misogyny is rampant. My mom didn't let me wear perfume,pants above my ankles because it would 'attract' men.
She didn't let me roam around the house without wearing a shawl.

Needless to say I don't talk to my mother anymore and i'm as good as dead to her. She even threatened to kill me because i didn't pray.

Religion is poison"
61,Because all of them are treated like queens! /s
62,they probably got the kuran memorised but don't understand arabic?
63,Guys who you really think cares about your atheist shit ?
64,DOUBLETHINK (literally 1984)
65,Don‚Äôt forget that this guy married a little girl Aisha and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old. Truly somebody to worship.
66,They‚Äôll usually say ‚Äúoh it was a different time‚Äù and then in the next breath say the words of prophets are eternal and apply to all people of all times. Same for Christianity. We have to go easy on holy books for being written ling ago but also they deserve to be the basis of all morality and (if they get their way) law.
67,"Their version of heaven is 72 virgins anyway.

[9] ""Each time we sleep with a Houri we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [i.e. Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetizing vaginas."" - Al-Suyuti, Al-Itqan fi Ulum al-Qur'an, p. 351"
68,"I don‚Äôt think the person who posted it is idolizing Muhammad. In another thread, he said he was an ex-Muslim who got banned from Twitter for this."
69,No she isn‚Äôt freed. She is freed after the death of her master‚Äôs if she gives him a kid.
70,i had never known about these women. incredible what they don't teach you in Islamic weekend school. I'll ask my imams and teachers about this when classes start again and report back!!
71,Because prophets are never wrong or bad according to Islam. They‚Äôre supposed to be the ideal human beings destined to lead the world for better.
72,so he basically got off* scot free. going by muslims' reputation this man should consider hiring bodyguards. that is his real name in the twitter handle
73,"Should've provided a source and then maybe his account wouldn't have been deleted.

Imagine me claiming that Dr Richard Dawkins likes little girls and when asked to provide a source, my response would be, ""Google it"". Lmao."
74,"You completely misinterpreted their intentions. This person is an ex-Muslim. If they were a proud Muslim, they wouldn‚Äôt be posting images of Muhammad."
75,"I don't understand how you could have thought the tweet was supporting it.

Even the most hardcore supporters will try to dismiss it by saying it was a different time period"
76,üòáüëèüëè
77,Doesn't your religion have rapist gods?
78,"In Arabic, Umm means mother. In that time, women were sometimes referred to as Umm-‚Äòname of firstborn child‚Äô instead of their actual name"
79,">Best not to use unverifiable meme type posts because it degrades the quality of this sub.

Too late. This sub has turned to shit and most comments here are exactly what atheists hate in religious people.

People on this sub and religious folks are 2 sides of the same coin lmfao."
80,"But if Mohammed was getting revelations from God, surely he out of everyone would know slavery was wrong? I‚Äôm sure God would've told him right?"
81,"idk why you are being downvoted, you are totally correct"
82,"Except this happened. The Ottomans loved their white sex slaves and white janissaries (slave soldiers).

The Ottomans trades over 1 million white European slaves. The word slave even comes from the word Slav, the people who live in the Balkans that was part of the Ottoman empire. 

Barbary pirates abducted people for this purpose as well. It only ended around 10 years before WW1 andonly started to be enforced when Turkey became Turkey."
83,Women were a commodity back then. They might just as well be Slavic or other ethnicity. You‚Äôre interpreting it wrong way.
84,Nice try lol. Not going to get shit here lmao. I see so many comments of people copy pasting from anti Islamic websites. It's the same stuff over and over again. Starting to get boring . Zero creativity in this sub.
85,You are literally too lazy to Google the Quran yourself?
86,"Yeah, so wise that his story ends with him being a complete idiot"
87,I mean‚Ä¶how dumb does a population have to be to consider not murdering a baby a wise decision.
88,i was wondering if it actually says in Bible that the marriage is between one man and woman. so many of prophets and biblical figures have multiple wives.
89,"Everyone know's, that a marriage is between a man and a man's rib."
90,Bibble ü§¨üò°ü§¨
91,you question the words of the MIGHTY JIMMY!?
92,"It's about control, the women are bound to him and not allowed to do as they wish,"
93,It‚Äôs for breeding
94,"Did you see the photo of all his (76) wives in long dresses who are gathered around the photo of Warren smiling towards the camera? It's so creepy! It has color groups: pinks, blues, pastel greens. It's as if they were part of teams of wives (the young ones, those of his father, those who already have children?)."
95,It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúchurch‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a regular Church. Like all the others.
96,"Was that the new one on Netflix? I have watched some other docs, and this one was absolutely chilling."
97,">ankles because it would 'attract' men

We are not wasps!"
98,"I can only say from my own experience about the ‚Äúpros and cons‚Äù that I experienced having a Muslim boyfriend for two years. He was extremely protective of me, and was hard core against partners lying and cheating, and against domestic violence. As someone who had just been in a physically abusive relationship prior, I felt this new relation was safe (and I am also against all of those things and am extremely loyal). However, the cons appeared soon after: not letting me wear shorts or makeup, being extremely controlling, cutting off my contact with my male friends and vetting potential female friends, making me tell him all of my passwords. And telling me that in any decision, we both had a right to say our part, but if there is still disagreement in the end, he got the final say because ‚Äúhe was the man‚Äù. In a way to convince myself that this was ok, I said ‚Äúwell, I agree to your terms but only because I trust your judgement more than mine‚Äî not because you are the man‚Äù. It was just more Stockholm syndrome after the first guy, except without the physical violence."
99,"Does your mom live in the US? I hear these crazy stories about parents threatening to murder or actually murdering their daughters in places like Pakistan, and it makes me wonder how common those kinds of beliefs are among American Muslims. Any thoughts?"
100,You apparently.
