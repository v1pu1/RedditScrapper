1,"You gotta understand something about this woman.  She is deeply insecure, probably because her whole purpose in life was raising her children and being the perfect wife.  Now her children are grown and have moved away.  Her purpose in life no longer exists.  On top of that, her husband cheated on her with a younger woman.  The only way she can live with herself is by advocating this type of philosophy.   If it's what God wants, it must be okay, right?  Right?"
2,I can see why Lilith defected from the Garden of Eden...god sounds like an assclown
3,God loves everyone but take every chance to piss on women to even right wing women need to stop being blind with hate and drop religion. Why serve a god that only loves white men if we going by the drawings the Romans made centuries ago.
4,She'll be happy with practicing Roman Catholic Joe Biden as president then i'd guess.
5,"Conservative logic : fathers are indispensable in a child's life if a child doesn't have one, they might grow up to become criminals but at the same time ¬†mothers are the only ones who can raise and care for children. Fathers need to be at work providing for their family. It is not their job to raise children."
6,FFS ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ This shit is hard to believe sometimes. Fucking religion breeds foolishness and ignorance. ü§Æ
7,Huh. Fascinating insight. Thank you. I despise this woman for her tweets as they are so negative towards younger folks.
8,"She has a masters degree in teaching, she also has a brsin tumour."
9,I really think that some sort of neurosis or psychosis is responsible for most people with these kinds of beliefs.
10,Agreed
11,"The The Transformed Woman has a proven brain tumor, I don't speculate (God will heal her, blah blah). I prefer to believe that all her religious delirium comes from there and that she could be a decent human, without her pathology. Otherwise, she is worse than a human turd floating in the filthy sewers."
12,"I human turd in the sewers is exactly where it should be, and it's not hurting anybody.  So ya, she's worse."
