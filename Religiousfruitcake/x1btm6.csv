1,It hurt itself in its confusion!
2,The Bible is the mark of the beast? Okay.
3,The crazy is truly omnidirectional.
4,"“Christ in you” Excuse me, he entered me without consent and scared the poor demon I have been housing, kindly get out Jesus before I call the cops."
5,"I clicked on this ad.

It wasn't as fun as I was hoping."
6,I saw these ads too and was so fucking confused as to what the hell they meant lmao
7,When EVERYTHING is The Mark of the Beast™ and it reaches critical mass and collapses in on itself  like a dying star.
8,They've come full circle and now they're pagan again
9,Oroboros
10,I love this ad. Absolute insanity
11,"Idk, they might be on to something"
12,"I kind of understand thinking that the Bible has become an idol, but something tells me my thinking and their thinking is very very different. A whole lot of people seem to almost worship the bible and the church more than they do God/Jesus. They hyper fixate on what the Bible does and doesn't directly say instead of the actual teachings of Jesus. It's part of how we end up with conservative christians (assuming they've even read the Bible, though they can idolize it without reading it). It's also a huge part of why I've left the church and am not really particularly Christian anymore. Jesus sounds like a really great dude with some pretty good teachings. He usually chose love and kindness and I respect the hell out of that. Yet so many people somehow manage to hate people and judge people and claim it's because the Bible says so. Quite frankly I don't care if that's what the Bible says, this Jesus dude probably wouldn't have chosen to hate or judge people. He might have married a prostitute for God's sake (it's complicated), I don't really think he would hate someone for being gay or something."
13,Is that Bonnie Nettles and Marshall Applewhite?
14,"I've heard about iconoclasts, but...err...bibkeclasts?"
15,"If the moon landing is fake, explain this"
16,would be such a fun idea to make anti-bible bible club shirts
17,Exposure to the vacuum of space can have impacts
18,The spirit of god in my lungs? No wonder I cough so much! 🤣
19,"Fellas, is it demonic to be Christian?"
20,They’re probably right in some weird way.
21,For once I agree. For evangelicals the bible is an idol.
22,I see the Cathars are still running strong.
23,This feels like the snake is starting to eat it’s tail
24,"Probably AI generated. Advertisers often use tools that throw together random words and images. Whatever words and images get more clicks are more likely to be reused. Over time, we should expect to see more and more strange advertisements because the crazier it is, the more likely someone is to click. In this case, even confused nonbelievers might be interested enough to click just bc it looks so ludicrous"
25,"This follows in *some* eastern Christian churches that view the Bible as a diminution, and do not use a textual basis for their theology... *(i.e. like Islam, Judaism, or Protestant/Sectarians in the west)* 

I don't have the quote in front of me, but I think it was Athanasius that stated that the Bible was a dumbing-down of Orthodox Theology, and wasn't really needed for doctrine... hence the theology of *Holy Writ within Holy Tradition*"
26,Earth is round ?
27,"Religious wackos who want to become religious leaders have to stand out among the millions of other religious churches and groups so they come up with something that would make someone stop and say ""wtf the fuck?!"" And then they fool themselves into making it an actual belief. And that's how it becomes a thing."
28,what
29,I kind of want one
30,biBleiSmaRkofBeAst
31,Slay??
32,Talk about swallowing the wrong way.
33,Why are they on the moon?
34,I remember these people~~ it’s a weird group some believe the kjv is the mark while others believe it’s the Bible in general.  Non of the ideas make aense
35,*It hurt itself in the confusion*
36,No wonder why creationists are stupid!
37,Friendly fire will not be tolerated
38,"**Spirit of god enters your lungs?**

So weed?"
39,"This one I buy. If there was an antichrist, the Bible would be a strong argument in their direction."
40,*jubilee*….Jubilee…. Jubilee!!!…. JUBILEE!!!!!…. JUBILEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
41,"So, I listen to a podcast about a girl who escaped from a fundamentalist Christian cult, and she came to the same conclusion about the way the cult treated the KJV bible. She explained why and how very well and it all made sense. But idk who these 2 people are, or what angle they're using to make this point so they could just be whack jobs."
42,I agree
43,"Is this **meta**, **based**, or did we just come full circle?"
44,"I would assume their platform is nuts, but consider that followers of the bible (Torah or both testaments) are valuing the word of man as divine and committing heresy to God.

Biblers are heretics."
45,Old guy is right.
46,"This channel is legendary, I’ve been on it few times and I swear it’s the weirdest shit, and reading the fucking comments is even funnier."
47,I guess it depends on what you’re smoking…
48,"god has entered my body, as a body, same size"
49,They finally did it. They’ve come full circle. The Bible is now a sin
50,I thought Marshall Applewhite was dead
51,white serifed text against red. where have i seen that before
52,"I want that Bible beast shirt, the confusion it would bring!"
53,Friendly fire
54,Ha! I'm assuming they derived the idea that the bible is the mark of the beast from the Bible itself. If this is real then we have witnessed the descent into full blown cuckoo.
55,Repost. Why? I posted this exact thing like a week or so ago.
56,Actually I posted this a little over half a month ago. Repost
57,This entire image is yet again an example of the sheer stupidity that is religion
58,That’s a new one 🧐
59,"reminds me of an ad i got: ""meet the man who invented the greek language"" for someone advocating for smth called ""predestinationalism"" i think"
60,The religions are fracturing so much these hybrid cults are going to become more common.
61,Tucker Carlson has died. See Fox News.
62,Wow... That's a new one. 🤦
63,This is interesting coz I incidentally read the same thing about Quran. Apparently there are satanic verses in Quran and all the bad parts of Islam comes from those satanic verses. It is fun to watch religious people recognise the inconsistencies in their belief systems.
64,"Oh shit I actually saw this pop up as an ad on YouTube, it's certified fruitcakery"
65,I REMEMBER SEEING SHIT LIKE THIS LIKE SEVEN YEARS AGO HOLY SHIT. How is that shit is still taking up ad space on YouTube?
66,"Not sure why the bible is a mark of the beast, but there are several Christian sects that believe many Christians worship the bible rather than god or Jesus. That would be idolatry."
67,Is this Pokemon? I feel like that's something a Pokemon game would say
68,"More likely this is a response to people on the left quoting specific parts of the Bible that invalidate their ideology of ""steal from the poor, kill people who disagree with you, be anti-abortion, ect"". 

It's only a matter of time before the Christian-right in the US turn their backs on and renounce the Bible because the literal Bible is too progressive for right wing christo-fascists."
69,"There's a surprising amount of people who think Satan wrote the new testament to deceive people, or something like that"
70,it's a license to make up even more bs.
71,That's where people got the idea from
72,"Well Mark is in it, so maybe they're on to something."
73,"It's so obvious I can't believe I didn't realize it myself!

This is like when it turned out Smokey was the Bandit!"
74,Except the right direction known as scientific method 😂
75,Please tell.
76,"They were always pagan at heart, they just didn't realize it as they lit the Yule log."
77,"It's paganism all the way down, I've been saying it for years!!"
78,Semitic neopaganism baby!
79,THIS.
80,"> ""*A whole lot of people seem to almost worship the bible and the church more than they do God/Jesus. They hyper fixate on what the Bible does and doesn't directly say instead of the actual teachings of Jesus.*""


How else would you know about Jesus except through the bible (*or Quran or book of Mormon which seems to some have influences from the bible*)?"
81,looks vaguely like them but it’s not. the woman that’s in this ad is still alive last time i checked (nettles died in 85 iirc) and the man died only recently. none of the theology lines up either so there’s no connection.
82,NFTs of this idea are definitely a thing
83,yeah I was gonna say that I had learned a lot about these kind of sects back in college and found them very interesting. not the kind of followers I'd typically expect though
84,"To be completely fair, ancient Judaic traditions didn't distinguish between the written Torah and God..... but that only makes these kooks seem kookier."
85,They're right in that sense.
86,"Which, yeah.  That's what American Christianity is.

Supply Side Jesus (white guy with long hair, white smock, brown strap thing, sandals) a cross, the bible, a few other such things are really just badges at this point.  Things to proclaim membership in the hate camp.  I've seen a church that had a Jesus Praying To The Cross display set up.  Because \*the clergy\* doesn't know or care much about the character's lore.

Reminds me of the idea cancer part of Youtube.  ""Hitler Spiderman Kills Pregnant Frozen Elsa"" just cram together a bunch of SEO keywords into a sentence that parses and then depict that thing to collect ad revenue from viewers that don't think too much."
87,I used to believe this when I was a Christian
88,It is
89,"Gotta catch 'em all (the demons, of course)"
90,"Well... Looking at it from a certain point of view, they could be correct. For one thing, Jesus couldn't have been *the* Messiah. That guy needs to be a direct descendant of David on the *paternal side*. Therefore Jesus cannot be the messiah. If he is, he can't also be the son of god.

If he isn't the messiah, that means his fulfilment of the prophecy is false and he is a false prophet. And who would be the major false prophet in the bible? Yes, the antichrist. A disciple of Satan. Of course Christ himself being the antichrist is weird as fuck. But it *would* be the ultimate disguise.."
91,"So, they are jews?"
92,Salman Rushdie has entered the chat...
93,"Satan wrote the New Testament? So, they agree with Jews now? Lol"
94,"Wait, what? The mark of the beast is introduced and found ONLY in the new testament"
95,"I had a Christian friend who believed Paul was the anti-Christ, therefore all of Paul's books in the New Testament were invalid and evil. It was an improvement to the religion honestly since the homophobia and misogyny in the New Testament comes from Paul."
96,He could've just invented social media and fake news a few centuries earlier if he really want to mess us up.
97,Honestly that’s the least insane take I’ve seen in a while.
98,"There are some Jewish people who believe that Christianity is just a way to get people to accept the god of Israel, but it's also a test for the Jewish people since it involves idolatry (*worshiping Jesus as a divine son of the biblical god*).            


If a christian believes that satan wrote the new testament, then I'm not sure how they're still christian."
99,"Oh shit, I once said that as a joke, and look what I manifested. 

I pointed out once that if I was a being trying to lead mankind astray, I'd pose as the prophecised saviour of the faith and make declarations about the old law being either invalid or reformed while spreading teachings that contradict prior scripture, then have some fake prophecies spread so that when the *real* Messiah shows up, they'd be branded a false prophet by my faithful."
100,"More like the satantific method amirite!
