1,Hail Satan!
2,So what I'm getting from this is education is a creation of the Devil?  Why is it that the devil seems like an actually decent being.  Having opportunity in life is pretty awesome honestly.
3,WhatðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²... who would've known that women being able to walk away from a shitty situation without fear of being tossed into poverty would end up increasing women's sense of self-worth.
4,God wants to chain Women and Satan wants to free them.
5,Satan sounds like a cool guy maybe women should look to him over the other one then
6,"And satan is the *bad* guy?
He seems tolerating and nurturing,and a whole lot more fun.."
7,Powerful? Yes. God-given? Donâ€™t blaspheme.
8,Quick! Ban the math textbooks! Education makes people independent!!
9,"There are plenty of women who have careers, who are with men because THEY LIKE THE PERSON. Not based on some stupid laws written by men 2000 years ago, not based on the sense of ""duty"" to give up their independence to serve as a house servant with benefits for some man who needs someone to care for him and drop crotch goblins.

These ultra-religious fundies must really hate it that women can actually have lives independent of the men's wants and needs.

And if the choice is between their religion's views of women as servants, caretakers and chattel and the odd notion of independent women living fulfilling lives without serving, I'm on Satan's side every time."
10,Marriage as a DIY project...where did I put the glue....or was it chains I am looking for?
11,Satans such a bro
12,Pretty much saying women should Stay in the kitchen.
13,Whatever keeps my pp from having a vv must be Satanâ€™s plan.
14,They certainly don't need male dinosaurs like you.
15,"People (especially women) like this.. Ugh, I know them. They're awful. Just pathetic, cruel, insecure, stupid and jealous people. One woman I know in particular, she grew up in a trashy, poor family. She came out somewhat ok and functional though, I think the one blessing bestowed on her was a kind of innate work ethic. Anyway, she is always tearing down other women, always. It is only exacerbated by the fact her loser son has two kids with different women and both refuse to talk to him. So, of course, it is these bitches destroying her beautiful sons' life. 

Ive heard her saying the exact same sorts of stuff. Like if women just obeyed their husbands more often there would happier families, working women are selfish, women being dependent on men helps men stay focused and confident etc etc.

Who knows, maybe she is speaking truthfully for a certain percentage of the population. I bet there are millions of people who actually would be happier living like that, I dont know. Some of us are probably just wired like that."
16,"It's not often modern Christians admit their god is a tyrant who coerces compliance by force and by necessity rather than promoting free choice, but there you go I guess."
17,Didnâ€™t even need the pic and handle to know who this was ðŸ˜…
18,"Wait, you mean women who don't have a life or death need for someone else to provide for them don't want to put up with abuse, disrespect, or guys who want to take away their rights and freedoms?

Maybe instead of blaming the women, these men need to improve themselves. If you can be replaced by an electric massager and an animal that shits in a box, what does that say about you?"
19,But what if I have a need for speed
20,Soâ€¦ Eve didnâ€™t need knowledge because Adam had a good paying job?
21,"Satan supporting women, love to see itðŸ™Œ"
22,Making shit up 101
23,"Education for women is EEEEVVVVIIIIILLLLLL!  They learn that they don't have to put up with being treated like shit, and their only purpose is to satisfy men and have babies!!!!"
24,"Good on Satan, take can of yourself. If you find someone who loves you, they would want that for you too."
25,"My lack of need for a man is from my gayness, not my degree lol."
26,Satan wants you to have the ability to live on your own work so you aren't reliant on a potentially abusive husband.
27,"Once again, we meet here to thank satan for their support for humans. Hail Satan!"
28,"Louder bro.

HAIL SATAN!"
29,Is there a good guy Satan meme?
30,I thought the handcuffs were for something else ðŸ‘€
31,Pretty sure itâ€™s actually a woman suffering severe internalised misogyny.
32,"Ugh, she needs to follow the rest of that holy book and shut the fuck up. ðŸ™„"
33,RAIN SATAN
34,"If I remember correctly, there is a set of beliefs that the god in the Bible is actually Satan, and that the real God lost the biblical war.

So basically that Christianity's God is actually the bad guy.

So there should be."
