1,What movie? For ehh research!
2,\*No Jesuses were harmed in the making of this film\*
3,Wonder if he goes on porn sites and does the same thing
4,"If he died for our sins, then it's okay to sin, right?

Then again, it was just for three days, so does that mean he took it back? Are we all going to Hell regardless? 

Maybe, by giving up his weekend for us, Jesus was just putting a down payment on our sins?"
5,Thatâ€™s a bot
6,Not sure if I can say it out directly but it stars Tamatoa's voice actor. Just look at his recent filmography.
7,"He's probably too ""holy"" to go to porn sites ðŸ’€"
8,"I'm assuming it's Nude Tuesday. It doesn't have a great rating but it says written by Julia Davis, and she is just great. If anyone ever wants an incredibly dark British sitcom I highly recommend Nighty Night that she wrote and starred in."
