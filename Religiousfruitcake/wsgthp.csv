1,Sound logic from OP.  And it's backed up by the Bible!  As you can see by the fact that the Bible contains no murders and God always forgives and never causes death. (Some exceptions may apply)
2,">We should do everything we can to support 
mothers who were rape victims

""Until the baby comes out. After that, we won't give a shit about the baby or the mother and look for other rape victims and repeat the whole process""

Very pro-life indeed."
3,You cant get that abortion but we can stone a gay man to death. TOTALLY Different.
4,"Forcing anyone to go through life changing, body changing experiences to bring into the world a child they don't want and will always resent is bad for everyone involved... especially a 14 year old. She's a child. Must a child sacrifice her entire future just for some arsehole paedophile?"
5,That fucking human being doesn't exist on any level. Also this isn't anyone's fucking business other than the victim.
6,"Their God disagrees with them.


Does that person think he knows better then his God?"
7,"Really? In the bible, there’s a SHIT ton of genocide committed by people who felt wronged or were wronged, and that gets a pass huh?



Or does the book of “absolute morality” only dictate morality when it lines up with your beliefs, that sure as shit don’t stem from
The bible"
8,"Unless it happens to them, then its ""different""

The only moral abortion is my abortion."
9,"It is not a surprising position though, if one believes a fertilized egg has the same rights as a born human.  

That position gives zero credence to mental and emotional states of rape survivors and how that can impact the quality of  their lives, partly because they push their religious beliefs  upon everyone that survivors will simply be OK if the survivors too believe in their religion. 

Quality of life has zero meaning other than they and families hopefully get it.  This seen in the euthanasia  debate.  


This isn't euthanasia, but similar. It is all about their blind best guess that only God should make life of death decisions.  There was a TX case in last couple years a baby's whose lungs kept collapsing. Nurses would be torn up reinflating them because of the pain it caused the child.  

The hospital decided they no longer treat the baby and of course the parents went to court with the idea a miracle could still happen.  When it finally cleared the courts and baby was taken off life support she of course died soon after.

It is simply people pushing their individual religious beliefs and not recognizing not all people believe God is the determiner of life and death."
10,Conservatives get a hard-on over rape and rape babies. It gives them hope they can procreate with any girl.
11,The kicker for these folks is that they would then support child visitation rights for the rapist.
12,20$ says she can defend the death penalty in the next breathe.
13,">Do I have the right to kill someone if I was harmed by another? No I don't.

**Arent these the same people that support stand-your-ground gun laws?**"
14,"Honestly I hope these people make themselves the loudest voices in the GQP. Shout from the rooftops about how you want to force people's daughters (of any age, no age is too young) to carry their rapist's babies. Proudly declare yourself the party of Rape for all the voters to see and hear."
15,Aren't these the same people that reserve the right to shoot people that trespass?
16,">We should do absolutely everything....

Great, they'll leave the baby with you then?"
17,"They do realize that self defense laws are a thing, right?... Right?"
18,">If someone breaks into my house imma kill em with my gawd given right to own a firearm 
  
-Same Guy"
19,https://youtu.be/ebBelcvWXks this is the video where I found the comment. You’ll see plenty more bat shit insane comments too.
20,Ultra religious people try not to be rape sympathizers (impossible)
21,So the death penalty should be outlawed.
22,Conveniently forgets about the death penalty and right to defend yourself
23,Plot twist is that they support the death penalty.
24,\*they would then proceed to go out and call people evil and physically assault and emotionally abuse them\*
25,Don't these people also love war?
26,Because they are sociopaths that honestly are just upset that they arent allowed to murder people they want so are retaliating. Because they are OBVIOUSLY not coming from a place of compassion.
27,"As someone who will do zero work to help a 14 year old raise a rape baby that's a pretty worthless opinion to have.

You aren't brave for sharing opinions like this, just a self-important asshole"
28,"Never mind about the “when life begins” debate, it’s the hypocrisy of the argument that is so nonsensical. How many conservative positions are antithetical to the sanctity of life? At every turn they seek to threaten life - the environment, economic policies, healthcare, caring for vets, social security and on and on. The hypocrisy alone discredits their position. This bullshit is exhausting."
29,"I think what’s lacking is comprehensive education. If you believe that conception = life, then of course abortion seems egregious and evil. But when you understand the nuance of the progression from conception to actual life (and everything in between), then you see it differently. But they’ve shut off the part of their brain that can reason this out."
30,"You absolutely have the right to kill a human being for harming you. For example if someone were to come at you with a knife, even the intent is enough to declare self defense and shoot that person dead in many places.

But that’s not even relevant as an unborn clump of cells isn’t a “person” anyhow."
31,Meanwhile if this fucking gremlin was attacked in such a way they would want to kill the fucker who did it to them. Hypocrisy at its finest.
32,"But apparently the fetus has the right to harm the mother, with zero consequences and no recourse available to prevent it. Disgusting."
33,"I'm sure this person will 100% care about trans suicide rates heavily impacted by Christian hate then, right, because his morals are sure to be consistent and not at all dependent on who he wants to subjugate to purge."
34,">Killing a human being is not the solution

Remind me how Christian Conservatives and support for the death penalty correlate."
35,">Do have the right to kill someone if I was wronged by another? No don't.

You do if your life is in danger."
36,"Aren't there american states that have a law that you can kill people that are on your property without permission? 


If your uterus is not your property then I don't know what is."
37,"The GOP sure love advocating for the Rapist fathers, don't they?

Rapists in red states are free to forcibly impregnate their victims while the GOP ensures that victim carries the pregnancy to term."
38,People like this deserved to be put on a watchlist and never allowed to be left alone with a child because clearly they can't be fucking assed to protect a child from traumatic situations
39,And how do we do that? By calling traumatized women whores outside of planned Parenthood. What a solid plan to help assault victims.
40,"i saw i believe it was an interview of activist Jane Elliot where she explains why the destruction on planned parenthood and outlawing abortions is because white people are scared to become a minority. 

A man named Ben Wattenburg wrote a book called The Birth Dearth in i think 1987 that said white people are in danger of becoming a minority. To counteract this they first thought to pay women to get pregnant like they do/did in Western European nations, but that would mean paying women of all races, so can’t do that. 

The next idea was to allow more immigrants into the country but most immigrants coming into the US are not white, so that’s a no. 

Third option is to make abortions illegal, because 60% of aborted fetuses are white babies and if they could keep that 60% that would solve their “birth dearth”

They are taking control of women’s bodies to keep those rich white men in control and secure more generations of white children to take their places. 

I’m also disturbed that the US is where people came for religious freedom but our government bases their ideals on a religion. What a time to be alive."
41,A lump of cells with no organs or a brain is not a fucking a human being
42,"The thing is, one absolutely DOES have the right to use deadly force to remove someone from their body. It is a legally recognised right to use appropriate force, including deadly, when in self-defence. He’s pretending that pregnancy is just just a cute little inconvenience but it is dangerous and life-altering and can turn deadly at any moment. Guess what. Yeah, we literally do have the right to stop someone from causing that harm even if it results in their death."
43,$100 says they also support the death penalty
44,"""Babies are just physical evidence that the whore partook in sex."" -pro life Christians"
45,"So we should be allowed to kill the kid so that the baby maybe has a chance to maybe be born? And then what? Obviously, once the baby is born, we don't give a shit about it or the mother right? TaXaTiOn Is ThEfT! WhY dO yOu WaNt HaNdOuTs? PuLl YoUrSeLf By ThE bOoTsTrApS, tHiS iS nOt CoMmUnIsT sOcIaLiSt RuSsIa ChInA"
46,We’re being blamed for Adam and Eve’s sins so why not the unborn for the sins of their fathers?
47,"I wonder if they support the death penalty, or cops killing potential criminals?  Based under this logic, they should absolutely be ridiculously against it, yet somehow, I get the feeling they actively rail for it 🤔"
48,">Killing a human being is not the solution.

Hard disagree. If a rapist put a human in me I'd want it out ASAP. I'm a guy, but still."
49,"“If you don’t want to be pregnant, don’t have sex. But also If you don’t have sex but have sex forced upon you (rape) you’re also expected to remain pregnant and carry to term”

So I just have zero control over whether I get pregnant or not, ever, great!

Edit: if someone violates my bodily integrity they’re getting murked. fetus, rapist, killer, doctor, or secret government organ collector"
50,"“We should do everything we can to support mothers that are rape victims”

Cool so we should let them have abortions?

“No!”

Okay but we’ll at least provide complete prenatal care, right?

“No!”

Okay but if they keep the child then we’ll pay for the cost of raising the child, right?

“No!”

Daycare?

“No!”

…Diapers?

“No!”"
51,"And will they help take care of that baby once it's born????   Absolutely not, as long as the baby is in the womb, we care for it.  Once it is born then your on your own."
52,">Just because something evil happens to you it does not give you the right to harm someone else.

Says the guy wanting to force little girls to have babies for their rapists because mummy and daddy didn't hug him enough when he was a kid."
53,"""Do I have the right to kill someone because they wronged me? No""

Erm, yes, depending on circumstances.

It's called self defence.

Look me in the eye and tell me you wouldn't shoot a man attempting to stab you; you definitely have the right to hurt someone if they do wrong to you, in the right situation.

There guys see everything in black and white with, without acknowledging the inherent grey in life. 

Killing someone in self-defence and ""killing"" a fetus because someone put you at harm are perfectly acceptable."
54,"Here’s my opinion: If I was unfortunate enough to be in that situation, I’d carry the fetus to term, no questions asked. 

However, it is not at all my place to tell others to do the same. They are in charge of their own bodies, and I have no authority over their lives. This whole debate is about choices after all, and I say let us all have the choice, whether we choose to keep the fetus or not. I can’t, and quite frankly shouldn’t, be the one in charge of other people’s lives and bodies. The option should be there."
55,"Every argument they make falls apart when one acknowledges that undeveloped fetuses are not sentient. They are not yet a, ""someone else."""
56,It completely falls apart with the last sentence and reveals who these ChristoFascist really are. Help the mother? Yeah right.
57,A fetus is not a person. Period. Even the Bible says so.
58,"By that logic, why is the death penalty a thing?"
59,These people lack basic empathy
60,"They’re Christians, they already don’t think"
61,Yet these same people will advocate for outright murder in the name of “self defense.”
62,"These are the same people who call themselves ""Christian Nationalists"" and who are ACTIVELY working to take basic human rights away from people. They're not done yet, they're still going."
63,My 2nd amendment and castle doctrine law would disagree sir.
64,"I mean, if they do something bad enough (like rape) it is legal to kill the person in self defense, so their argument really makes 0 sense"
65,"It shouldn't be up to *them* what anyone else does.

If they're OK with their 14yr old daughters being mama's via rape... that's their problem.

*Why TF is it our problem?*

**religious nutjobs is why**"
66,">Do I have the right to kill someone if I was wronged by another? No I don't

Now ask them what they will do if someone breaks into their house"
67,"These people: ""Being wronged doesn't give you the right to take another human being's life."" 

Same people: ""I'll shoot anyone who tries to take my guns away."""
68,Remember when God murdered a whole city's worth of first born children? Apparently God was wrong to that according to this high IQ Christian
69,"yeah guys this clump of cells is worth more than the well being of this underage “mother.” the emotional turmoil of carrying her rapists “child,” the potential physical damage and chance of death.. apparently the “child” is worth all that, at least till it’s born. at that point, they don’t give a shit anymore."
70,Sure but what kind of family support do they support after the forced birth? Zero!
71,And yet they are so pro-Castle doctrine... such hypocrites.
72,It’s so easy for men to sit back and spew this shit when they would never have to experience it themselves.
73,"![gif](giphy|pcoa9GfYAkJvS7exrl|downsized)

WTF 0.0"
74,So then they must be against the death penalty?
75,"These are the same people who engrave bible verses on bullets.

Luke 22:36, anyone? Anyone? Hypocrites?"
76,Why do they think they’re everybody’s shitty parent?
77,"Isn't this just fundamentally untrue? Like, these are the same people who support the death penalty, whose own religious text regularly supports the maiming and murder of those who have wronged you?"
78,"Actually, depending on how bad someone wrongs me I have an absolute right to blow them away. It's called ""Stand Your Ground"" and I'll bet money you support that."
79,"Wait until that baby grows up and comes out as trans or gay or a yoga instructor whatever that they dislike, then they will want to kill them again..."
80,"Fine. I’ll bite. A blastocyst is a human being. Why does this human being have the right to leach nutrients from my body, which for nine months, is the only place it can be housed? There are many people who depend on others for survival, but they don’t have a right to that other person’s bodily sustenance and functions. Their care givers have the right to find new work if the care becomes too taxing. Parents are allowed (if they can even afford it) to outsource child care. Why are fetuses and pregnant people exceptions?"
81,"But you presumably do have a right to decline donating your organs to save another human, so that's a thing."
82,And yet so many of them are pro death penalty…
83,"Everything you can...?

Yeah, fuck off with that. You people aren't even willing to adopt."
84,"I feel like if you think believe a 14 yo child should be forced to carry her rapists baby that you’re pretty much as bad as the rapist himself. 

That shits evil."
85,...but of course the whole part about helping victims of rape was a total \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* lie.
86,But they still support capital punishment and want to execute people involved with abortions.
87,"But think about who you're ""hurting"". Unless you have the same emotional capability as a fetus, you have no right saying things like this"
88,"these people have zero issue with the usa doing endless wars in the middle east

&#x200B;

and they practically worship the military"
89,"So it's the fallacy of everything happens for a reason. God's plan for this child is to maybe be killed by birthing the rape baby. This is the bullshit they use to excuse it. 

This is also the excuse the rapist uses sometimes for the act of raping. If God didn't want it to happen it wouldn't. They're the same people who refuse to understand why this in turn makes atheists out of survivors. They're the Bad Thing. They don't have the empathy required to both see that victim of rape as a person or to see why this argument is vomit inducing horror. 

Take it as a sign they're not someone to trust with your children or your life (if you didn't end up unable to have children due to the complications of rape and childbirth at that age)"
90,"But praying to God for a miscarriage with the priest is the biblically canonical version. 

""Christian"" nationalist right winger freak"
91,Because they care more about pushing their ideals than they do about thinking for two seconds
92,It’s totally fine to shoot an adult who stepped on my lawn though.
93,now ask them about the 2nd amendment 🥴
94,"Mother Mary, in her early teens, was impregnated by god without her consent. Unexpected pregnancy and forced birth sit at the very heart of Christianity."
95,At least in that JRE episode joe actually had the balls to fight the point the guy was making but only because it affected some he loved.
96,"I agree to the extend that if you were raped you can't just kill someone. 



BUT this fetus is not someone. 



This fetus is not a person yet, so you can abort it so you don't have to give birth to your rapist' child."
97,But shooting a dude for standing in your yard is okay?
98,"They actually think a fetus is a baby. This is why they shouldn't be allowed to make medical decisions for another person. By their logic, from now on if anyone needs an organ transplant they should just take it from someone else."
99,"Well it's really nice hearing that coming from the rapists mouth, but the rest if us don't give a shit.

<edit> the rape babies can be harvested for stem cells. Maybe then they'll be useful"
100,Kill the fucking guy and his offspring.
