1,"Ah yes, political correctness, thy great ancient concern of yore, plaguing the blonde-haired blue-eyed white men of the Middle East thousands of years ago.

But worry not, because the last laugh was had by getting publicly and painstakingly murdered and tossed in a cave."
2,"Ah yes, white, blonde hair blue eyes, definitely not brown, shirt with curly black hair and brown eyes, nooo Jesus was so special he wouldn't have looked like anyone else from his time period"
3,Jesus was a Christian? So he believed in himself?
4,Who can forget that passage in the New Testament when Jesus cheats on his wife with a porn star.
5,Wait...so Jesus also had sexy fun times with sex workers while his wife was pregnant and then paid hush money to sex workers? Well...I suspected Jesus was a bit of a strumpet.
6,"Lol Jesus

They keep using that name but I donâ€™t think they know what it means"
7,why does the eyes looks like they did spice...
8,Satire?
9,"Sermon on the mount Maralago 
#1. Thou shall grabâ€™em by the pu**y"
10,Not white. Not blue eyes. WAS Jewish. So also not a Christian.
11,That photo on the right looks more like Michael Jackson than Trump.
12,"Can you imagine the size of the crane to hoist him to the cross, though? No way you can do that without machinery...

(That's where the comparison stops...)"
13,"That's not Jesus, that's Micah Bell"
14,Woah! Who knew Jesus + Trump = Thom Yorke
15,Blonde hair and blue eyes. Yeah thatâ€™s very common in the middle east at that time.
16,"Jesus white chirstian? He came from palestine, he was definitly dark skinned, and he wasn't christian but jew since chirstianity is the religion born from the following his teaching but still he prayed in the temple, had the jew festivity. Blond same as before it's very unlikely that a man from palestine was blond 2000 years ago."
17,"To continued the comparison: 

Got punished for our sins and disappeared for an undisclosed amount if time, but at least 2000 years...

I think people can get behind that."
18,Can't wait for Trump to die for all our sins.
19,"You can argue over Jesus' ethnicity and hair colour but what cannot be argued with is the fact he wasn't Christian. He was a Jew.

As a Brit, looking at all these right winged Christian posts from America it is both funny and scary. Pre-Trump these would have been ridiculed as obvious satire based on lazy stereotypes but now this is what those people are literally saying..."
20,Jesus from middle east
21,Jesus wasn't white and Trump is about as Christian as Aleister Crowley.
22,"Jesus wasn't ""white""

Mother's name was *Mariam*

Don't know his eye or hair color, but I can guarantee you it wasn't *blone and blue*

Political Correctness is a post-modern term (ideology)

There was no *""jewish elite""* in post-Macedonian, or Roman territories

Jesus never laughed, that we know of..."
23,obvious satire
24,How can they still think jesus was white ?
25,Trump is white? I thought he was orange
26,"They forgot:
-	Hangs out with criminals and prostitutes"
27,"Okay, who forgot to crucify Trump at the age of 33?"
28,Think its satire
29,If Jesus was white then Ancient Greece was straight
30,I still havenâ€™t got further than â€˜white Christianâ€™â€¦
31,"Yeah, thinking about it, i distinctly remember Ronald MacDonald Trump laughing hysterically when he got kicked out of the whitehouse."
32,Parody right?
33,Blond hair blue eyes? From the middle east? Really?
34,These idiots who actually think Jesus had blond hair and blue eyes are hilarious.
35,"More like:

- Both talk a great line of bullshit
- Have an insufferable fan base and a weird personality cult
- Have books written about them by biased third-parties who like to embellish their alleged accomplishments in order to further their own agenda
- Wouldn't have amounted to anything without their family resources"
36,Jesus is less likely to have blue eyes and white skin. This may be unsettling to Americans but it is what it is.
37,[these guys need to watch this](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/v3wp5b/why_racist_when_you_can_be_american/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
38,Oh boy. Lot to unpack here.
39,"blonde hair blue eyes lol, lmao even"
40,"1. No, early depictions have quite dark skin

2. Sure?

3. It was fucking black hair in the oldest colour depiction.

4. Whaâ€”

Also, he had a [donkey head](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexorig.jpg) like [his father.](https://www.deviantart.com/thomasp3864/art/The-God-of-Alexamenos-917785995)"
41,I'm pretty sure Jesus would've busted out a whip and whipped trumps ass if he were around today
42,But Jesus was not a crook.
43,C.. CHRIstian.. BLOND HAIR BLUE E-asdfl;kj\*\*FOUGHTPOLITICALCORRECTNESS\*\*!?@#?!@
44,Should we tell them jesus wasnt whiteâ€¦
45,Aryan Jesus
46,Greatest DERP ever.
47,"None of these are true. The closest is the mothers name, which at least derives from the same name."
48,What jesus is that?
49,How did CHRIST become CHRISTian? I wonder how stupid they will feel when they go to church to discuss how Jewish ole JC was.
50,"\>white  
\>blond hair, blue eyes

Mother of all historical revisionism."
51,Wasnt Jesus jewish? AND he was from the middle east
52,literally only one of these things is true about jesus lmao
53,"> - Had the last laugh

*Hysterical laughing and hammering*"
54,I mean it's litterally blasphemy at this stage o.O
55,Jesus was a jew and the son of god... doesn't that technically make him the jewish elite
56,Jewish - Christianity comes after his/her death. Definitely not white nor would have computer enhanced blue eyes. Not sure either are/were much of a laugh. Jesus had more original hair - the one thing in common is neither would be/are blonde
57,"1. Jesus was Jewish, Christianity did not exist yet
2. OK, they got one thing right
3. He was middle eastern, more likely to have had black hair, brown eyes and brown skin
4. Fought *for what would one day be called* political correctness. FTFY
5. ...didn't the Romans give him the nickname ""King of Jews""? that sounds very persecuted /s
6. So is Trump gonna be put to death for our sins, then?"
58,"> Mother called Mary

These are the kind of people that thought the plotline of Batman versus Superman was fantastic."
59,"They stopped with throwing the money lenders out then?

Forgot Jesus was a carpenter?"
60,">Fought political correctness

I mean, technically that's true. Only Jesus probably fought FOR political correctness, while Trump fought against it."
61,I thought Jesus's last words were more of a cry. Or pleading
62,What's with the Jeopardy-styled formatting?
63,Jesus was middle eastern so would have had brown hair/eyes. Jesus believed in giving to the poor and healing the sick for no cost - he believed in Universal Healthcare. Bible jesus would hate capitalism all things considered.
64,"Does this mean the Golgotha part is coming up? 
At least as many would attend as came to the inauguration. The biggest crowds. 
Might be his best ratings ever."
65,"""Hung around with prostitutes"" is about the only similarity I can think of"
66,"ðŸ“£ðŸ“£ Jesus, who didn't exist, was a middle eastern Jewish man and looks exactly like the people who fill you with hatred on a 
daily basis ðŸ“£ðŸ“£"
67,Jesus literally died on the cross in a horrifying murder. Trump literally just Tweets and eats cheeseburgers. The fucking audacity to compare.
68,Since from when was Jesus white?
69,Jesus LITERALLY CANT BE CHRISTIAN HE FUCKING DIED BEFORE IT WAS INVENTED HES A JEEEEEEEW
70,How do these people who believe this shit actually function as adults in the world?
71,I hope this is satire....
72,"How could Jesus possibly be a Christian, the religion literally started when he died?"
73,I canâ€™t imagine Trump dying in a public BDSM scene.
74,This is going to be a legitimate religion once that dude kicks the bucket
75,JesÃºs was Jewish. And the only god trump has ever bowed down before is money.
76,If you think this isnâ€™t satire your blinded by hate
77,"Trump supporters aka maga aka the base of the Republican Party, conservative movement, are lunatics."
78,That picture though. Eyes photoshopped so blue don must be high on that sandworm spice
79,"White Christian? Blonde hair, blue eyes? This is satire right?"
80,Christ was from the Middle East and had blue eyes and blond hear. Suuuuuure.
81,"JÃ©sus was Jewish by his mother, probably not white, and probably not had blue eyes nor blond hair."
82,# Jesus was Arab
83,Jesus wasnâ€™t Christian lol
84,"Jesus wasnâ€™t white, and was a Jew. Also Trumps daughter is Jewish."
85,Lol. Jesus must have had a lot of sunburns in the Middle East.
86,I think if white supremacist MAGA assholes saw a real picture of Jesus they would shit their pants
87,This has to be satireâ€¦ at least I hope so.
88,Pretty sure if Jesus was real he would be a little arab...
89,"White Christian with a mother called mary? What are the odds!!! 

So fucking stupid its not even funny."
90,I still find it hilarious that none of these people realize that the modern interpretation of Jesus is because of Da Vinci who was super gay. There is a 0% chance Jesus was white
91,Please tell me your joking
92,more Trump content please :)
93,ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®
94,It's obviously satire...
95,He is VERY FAR from being a christian.
96,They are both conmen deified by a cult of followers.
97,See other religious groups are cruel or violent. Maga people are just stupid.
98,"This is a troll meme.  Iâ€™m rather sure it was posted by someone who doesnâ€™t like Trump as a gag.

Trumpâ€™s daughter, son-in-law, and grandchild are Jewish (a presidential â€˜firstâ€™ I suppose).  Trump followers would know that.  The whole thing smells of a troll."
99,Enough Internet forever
100,"""We'll get the last laugh""

- losers"
