1,"So, children's bodies make an adult man want to penetrate their immature organs against their will, or groom them to acceptance? Your God wants children as sex objects for grown men?

Is that fatherly? Brotherly? Uncley? Neighborly?
Are Islamic males no better than chimpanzees who will rape? Islamic men are to be understood to not have human compassion, as Allah does? Just feral animals?"
2,"People who try to make excuses for pedophilia are garbage, pathetic, wastes of human life. Rotten down to every atom in their body."
3,"Well, this Iman is a pedophile.   No question"
4,"These men have covered up every piece of skin on women to the degree that they now get insanely horny every time they see an ankle. It’s has become pathological so even kids now tease their senses. 

It’s absolutely fucking disgusting."
5,Thats fucked. Imo it shouldn't be made illegal because it's a mental disease but God damn people who actually f**k kids and guys who say shit like that should be locked up
6,This kind of public statement from an imam should automatically authorize the police to search his computer and use any evidence found.
7,How about some self-control?
8,Says a paedophile. Really.
9,Sounds like “imam” and”youth pastor” are interchangeable.
10,"Way more men are attracted to children than we realise. A study of non deviant males AKA normal males found some truly alarming results. 52% showed an arousal response to little girls aged 4-10 and 83% showed an erectile response to girls aged 10-16. Freund, K., & Costell, R. (1970). The structure of erotic preference in the nondeviant male. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 8(1), 15–20. doi:10.1016/0005-7967(70)90029-x "
11,"Well, he's definitely a pedophile."
12,He’s fucked kids is my takeaway from that
13,How to spot the pedo
14,What a dirty nonce!
15,These people (I shouldn't generalize. I mean this person and  people like him) are really projecting the image that Islamic men are a bunch of dogs who have no control over their hormones.  Should we have leash laws for these perverts?
16,So...he's getting investigated when?
17,Said the paedo.
18,I am dead inside.
19,That's fucking disgusting
20,Wood chipper go Brrrrrrr
21,when you are in a strawman competition (without even showing proof the sheikh said anything lol) but youre opponent is an antitheist
22,Pedophilia is a normal thing in islam. muslims look at their prophets life and say its okay to marry a 9 years old child.
23,"Married at 6, consummated at 9."
24,"There are so many of them, too many. Infact there's someone doing just that on this very thread."
25,"Exactly. If someone chooses to follow and defend the religion where the prophet is a pedophile, then I dont want to hear anything they have to say. People need to learn that you don't need religion to be a good moral person, and having a religion doesn't automatically make you good and moral."
26,"Even women who are completely covered up aren't safe from them. The moment they step out of the house unaccompanied, they're in danger."
27,"In this case, the word pedophilia is being used to mean those actually fucking kids. He seems to be saying actually doing it should be allowed. Which is the wrong way to use it. That is child molesters. 

Actual pedophilia is not quite a mental illness as you suggest, though there is a version that does go as far as being a mental illness. But being a pedophile in the proper meaning of the word, not as used here or in most media, is not a choice or an action. It is simply an attraction you are born with, and can not change. And which the vast majority do not act on. Pedophiles are no morel ikely to end up being sex criminals then any one else is. 

I want it to be clear here, as I have seen the words pedophilie and pedophilia used incorrectly on this sub, so I want to make what i am saying clear. I am not talking about anyone who actually has or tries to have relations with kids. Those are child molesters, or predators, or what ever. I am just talking about the medical definition of pedophile, which is not a choice, and can't be changed, but most never harm anyone any way, and are no more likely to then any one else. They understand kids can't consent, and aren't willing to harm someone for their own enjoyment. Those types of people, there is nothing wrong with. But any one who does actually have sex with a kid, they are the scum of the earth and should burn."
28,The problem is the goverment is far right wing and lets people like this say these things.
29,Why bother with self control when you can control others?
30,Expecting self-control from this kind of man is like expecting emus to fly.
31,"I wonder what results they would get if they tested women.  Probably about the same, I suspect.  🤮"
32,"This is why it’s generally not acceptable to live your entire life by the words of a literal ancient text. One that we do not and cannot verify the complete accuracy and consistency from then until now. But hey it lets these creeps sexualize kids, which sounds pretty similar @catholicchurch"
33,"What country are you in?


Edit:

You're a turk."
34,Under what basis did you come up with this analogy?
35,That is not the Mohammed story with Aisha. Much more complex. And you need to check out what Tennessee is doing to remove all age restrictions to consent.  Massachusettes girls can marry at 12.
36,">~~consummated~~ raped at 9.

FTFY"
37,"So, islam men are basically incel edgelord niceguys."
38,"I hear what you are saying but realize that there are no boundaries on language. What is or isn't considered a definition becomes very much dependent on the society using it. When a word is misused enough it becomes the new acceptable definition. I think if you are wanting the definitions confined then you are doing the right thing in explanations. 

Anyone who looks at children in any sexual manner disgust me on a deep level"
39,Women would be far more prevalent in sexual abuse or CP cases if that were so. Considering women are the primary caregivers of children. Its still overwhelmingly males committing sex offences against children.
40,"A good man on his own will do good and a bad man will do bad.

To make a good man do bad you need religion"
41,"Ignoring all the crazy bullshit a lot of those ancient texts have, some of them do have pretty solid advice and ideals."
42,Prophet married aisha when she was 6
43,also marrying kids were quite common amongst companions of prophet
44,It's always religion too. Sensible people would never consider anything less than 16 - 18 to be the youngest age a person can make adult decisions and even then that seems too young for marriage in my opinion
45,"And it’s sick just like aisha 

Whataboutism isn’t an argument"
46,Everyone knows that simply putting it how their text did
47,"I  do not understand how you need to put modern mores on the historical past.

Why signal out Islam, as of it is an outlier at the time?

Or even in the world today? Where Tennessee evangicals are trying to get age totally removed from consent, not just marriage like Massachusettes(age 12), but any sexual contact if the male feels it is a good relationship.

I resent people being all over Mohammad when this is at America's doorstep. Now, present Iman bullshit, I consider as dangerous as all the recidivists Evangelicals, Federalist Society, MAGAs.

Quiverfuls, quivering."
48,"Definitions do change, and that can be a pain. That is why pointing out what you mean in ins t ances like this is important. 


That said, I can understand disgust at anyone who would look at kids and actually be willing to do anything. But for those unlucky enough to just be born pedophiles, I don't feel the same. It isn't a choice, and they can't get rid of it. In much the same way you can't get rid of being gay. And while there are similarities no I am not saying pedophilia is a sexuality, it just has some things in common with them."
49,"No, because they are reported far, far less by the survivors.  Personal knowledge."
50,"Such as ""don't kill"""
51,"I agree, but to paraphrase George Carlin, if you need a 2 thousand year old book to tel you to not attack people and generally be a sick, the problem is you."
52,"They were also common amongst the people of that time, the enemies of the prophet made fun of him for everything and mocked him for everything except him marrying a ""6 year old"".

Aishas age was never even mentioned in a Hadith or the Quran, find me irrefutable proof where it was mentioned in the Quran or a Hadith.

What the Quran does say is to marry a woman who is past the age of maturity, which means they are an adult and no longer a child.

You are just repeating the same narrative over and over again with no evidence."
53,No it isn't always religion. It was usually short life spans and needing to get on with the begetting. Like Sansa getting married or sexually ripe at menstruatiin.l
54,"It is when you single.out what happened 1500 years ago in the face of happenings today. The Iman is contemporary and is a religious fruitcake..the historic actions of religious texts characters are not. This sub was designed to not knock the tenants of the religion, but the egregious actions of today's proponents of the religion."
55,"It gets put to modern mores because people insist on treating the man as a moral example for modern men. Pedophilia is wrong today, so Muhammad - as a commonly cited prophet - deserves the harshest criticism imaginable.

The evangelicals get shat on incessantly for their abuses. Pointing fingers elsewhere won't lessen Muhammad's burden; and not everyone lives in the US or anywhere where Christian bullshit is the most relevant."
56,Because people are justifying it saying it ok now!!!
57,No doubt that accounts for a small percentage of cases. I've worked in rape crisis and DV for over 20 years. We see maybe 3-4 cases involving female offenders per year.
58,"Why are you comparing a person who's supposed to be a person sent by God, and who is supposed to be the best of people to the regular guy of his time? Are you saying that he didn't know any better than the average person at the time?

Doesn't the fact that he worked with the moral standards of his time even with things that we know are wrong today prove that his message and religion are not valid and good for all places and all time until the end of days as he claimed?

Aisha's age was not mentioned in the Quraan, but it was mentioned in several Sahih hadiths and I'm sure that you know that. In one such sahih hadith she mentioned herself how old she was when he married her and had sex with her.

You know very well that Islam isn't practiced on the basis of what's mentioned in the Quraan only, it's practiced based on the Quraan as a primary source then based on the hadith and sunnah as well.

Let me give you a tip, leave the defence of Islam to the more knowledgeable and experienced apologists because all you're succeeding in is making it look even worse than it really is.
You're doing anti-dawah."
59,"So Islam is ""universal"" but marrying a 6 year old child is okay because that was common at that time. You are just being denial, also there are so much evidence that aisha was 6. For example: Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234"
60,So nasty 🤮
61,"Well i think your or even their opinion of the interpretation is pointless when either can be argued. A believer and pedo today can easily use the Quran to abuse the public in their congregation. Words can be twisted and when ""things have changed"" is an ok argument then so is ""Scripture is clear and nothing has changed"" is still going to get people killed and raped"
62,"Narrated 'Aishah:  
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: or Six years. He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old.

**Grade: Sahih (Al-Albani)**

Reference : Sunan Abi Dawud 2121

Narrated \`Aisha:  
  
that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).

Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 5133

It was narrated that:  
Abdullah said: “The Prophet married Aishah when she was seven years old, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine, and he passed away when she was eighteen.”

**Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)**

Reference : Sunan Ibn Majah 1877"
63,"Why would the most perfect human being on earth rape a little girl, if your excuse is ""short life spans"" then that's absolutely wrong in this case, pregnancy at that age is deadly, and just sexual intercourse at the **age of 9** is extremely unhealthy and dangerous."
64,"I understand your point about the use by some Muslims of practices not approved for much of modern times that were actions of Muhammad. It does seem to threaten many Muslims who cannot see that what happened at a time in the past is not good for society.

I disagree that evangelicals, when called out, have the heroes of the Bible excoriated."
65,"Again, proving my point again you're not giving me evidence of that claim.

You're just using some words that don't even make sense in this context and you're not even relating to this subject.

I never once mentioned that time has changed, what I said was that women mature at much later age In these times.

Also the idea of having sex with a girl in the Western world doesn't make sense, In Portugal the age of consent is 14 yet in England it's 16 but in other countries in the west it's as high as 21?

So who is right or wrong here?"
66,"He didn't rape her. According to her. Many cases in US courts today say that rape itself doesn't actually harm  girls. 

I think it is all bad. But to vilify what happened 1500 years ago when we are pretty OK with it today when it gets to the courts seems disingenuous.

Be angry at the Iman and the courts, but why put today's mores (if it is even actually true) on what happened in the very distant past. 

Why no fervor over selling your children into slavery, as was OK in the new and the old testament, even into sexual slavery. 

I get downvoted when I tell.people what is happening today..in the US. Yall just want to dump on Muslim.

And not once has someone else joined in to condemn current action by Christians..Today!   Just beat the drum of anti Muslim fervor. 

I condemn the Iman, like I do the US courts and.legislators,  evangelicals, because it is today and needs to be condemned today.. Those actions  I write my letters and tell others about at every opportunity. When is it going to be group hated on? 

Hypocrisy offends me. Bigotry offends me. Sexual predation offends me. History just is, learn from it.

I never read that when right wing evangelicals call on women who have abortions to be killed, or the doctors who perform them be killed, and it be tied into King David having the husband of Bathsheba killed (when he had hundreds of concubines and sex slaves, of no age limit. Why? Or when Lot offered up his daughters to be raped as it was a greater offense to be a bad host. Then his daughters got him drunk and raped him. Christianity and Judaism never gets called on just their historical past. Only Islam.

Keep maintaining this justice hard on for Iam and being hypocritical. Such justice warriors."
67,"My evidence is found in every religion throughout time (except for the Jains) Mass murders and executions in the name of god are hardly the exception to the rule and more like the rule. Same with religions and pedo defending. 

As far as who is right or wrong on the age of consent the answers are clearly right there in your statement. 

Every country or group is using a different classification and basing it on their own beliefs.

I personally would have to look at the most obvious evidence and that is the biology......of the brain. The consent part is the part we should be most concerned with after all. The human brain does not stop developing and maturing well into our twenties. Now if that is your basis (a fully grown adult) then 21 or 22 seems reasonable but 16 seems like a long way from mature. I don't know what the perfect age may be because I think people also have a maturity age that no one is tracking. Some people mature faster and can handle adult responsibilities sooner than others so it may be an individual basis."
68,"This is literally r/religiousfruitcake, Abrahamic religions without exception are always being criticized because of their past, and because of the current times,  pastors are raping children and being protected in Christianity every day. All Abrahamic religions are the same, barbaric, disgusting, evil cults.

""according to her, he didn't rape her"". Well, I'm afraid a 9-year-old cannot consent to sexual intercourse with a man in his 50s.

A young girl who used to scrape the semen of the prophet, and at the time when marriage was consummated was playing with dolls. Do you think that isn't rape? Just portray that image in your head, It's disgusting for Mohammed to even think about it-

It was narrated that 'Aishah said:

""I often scraped it (semen) from the garment of the Messenger of Allah with my hand.""

**Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)**

Reference: Sunan Ibn Majah 537

It was narrated that 'Aishah said:

""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls.""

**Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)**

Reference: Sunan an-Nasa'i 3378"
69,">I think people also have a maturity age that no one is tracking. Some people mature faster and can handle adult responsibilities sooner than others so it may be an individual basis

And that's what I said, Islam does not allow you to marry someone (man or woman) who is not mature and isn't fully developed.

You are here talking about mass murdering while I was having a conversation about marriage, if you want to get into the discussion of religious violence we can certainly do so. 

If Islam was preaching for violence and terrorism then why is not every Muslim engaging in these matters? Why has so called ""Islamic terrorism"" come up in the past 30 years? 

I would be more than happy to discuss any of your evidence and concerns if you are happy to put them forward to me, however I just want you to leave your misconceptions behind and talk to me with an open heart."
70,"And that's what I said, Islam does not allow you to marry someone (man or woman) who is not mature and isn't fully developed.

No this is a huge difference. One is adults who have their own wants and motives ""deciding"" on when a child is mature enough for them to get their way. 

I am saying individual people within their own maturing process can grow at different rates. The point being more towards a 16 immature is a lot different than a 16 year old who is mature in behavior and thought.

I don't have misconceptions as those are an outside influences judgement of my own interpretations. I feel like you are very much close minded and when you say ""open heart"" all I hear are all the other religious fanatics saying the same words for ""Believe anyway despite what you think you know"""
71,"Thank you, first life expectancy was short at the time so child marriages were very common, second of all not all Muslims are Islamic extremists (we also have to deal with them, mostly the taliban)."
