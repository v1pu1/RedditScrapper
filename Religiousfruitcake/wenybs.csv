1,"""we should respect other beliefs""

""Other beliefs will be cursed if they spread their gospel""

Nice contradiction"
2,"I love how they say this not realizing that literally their earliest writings were about a guy persecuting Christians in areas he didn't have any authority, swearing to God he's telling the truth, had a change of heart, and just ignore those people over their with their different gospel.

Even an ounce of critical thinking would raise an eyebrow at that."
3,"Paul honestly sucked. He is the walking definition of legalism and had incel tendencies to boot. I’ve constantly been in churches where they worship Paul over Jesus (although they would never admit it) 

I think I read it somewhere else, but I refer to this type of Christianity as “paulianity”"
4,"Well, fuck this Paul character then."
5,"So, how do they know that THEY aren't the ones accursed?"
6,Btw he's talking about the Jews.
7,Btw he's talking about the Jews.
8,"This is like 180 degrees from the words of Jesus himself.  Jesus taught in Mark 9:39 to leave other sects alone, not to condemn anyone.  Paul is consistently inconsistent in his writing of what Jesus actually said and did."
9,So Paul's an asshole? Insteresting.
10,"The funny thing is that this passage talks about Paul being surprised at a group of Christians who believed a modified version of the gospel that he was preaching, which was Jesus' teachings, which in turn included ""respect others beliefs"" and I'll have to paraphrase here because I don't remember the exact wording, ""Don't be a prick."" The modified versions did away with most of the stuff that Jesus taught and brought back the rabbinical interpretations of the laws of Moses."

I'm an atheist but I am interested in secular biblical scholarship.  To be fair, most of the writings of Paul that are most fucked up regarding women (women should be silent, cover their hair, modesty, etc.) are likely forgeries or later insertions into his writings.  1st Timothy is almost certainly a forgery, and there's a good argument to be made that the problematic language in 1st Corinthians (""As in all the congregations of the Lord’s people. Women should remain silent in the churches, They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church"") is either a  verse that was itself forged and interpolated into the text, or a textual corruption, where Paul was in fact criticizing the Corinthians for holding this view.  Paul certainly had patriarchal views, but he also had some very egalitarian views, views that were far too egalitarian for later christians in the first century (hence the forgeries of 1st Timothy and other books, intended to make it seem like Paul was far less egalitarian than he actually was)."
12,">""Don't be a prick.""

Seems like a lot of them don't follow this, like they do to some other teachings"
