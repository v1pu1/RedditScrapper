1,"Nothing. The poster thinks that if he spams his religious bullshit wherever he can and ambush you unawares with it, he can make it live rent-free in your head to the point that you either convert or at least preoccupy yourself with subject and inadvertently help giving it undeserved attention. 

You posted it here, so he's already achieved more than if you simply ignored it."

I've seen this before they do this on videos that literally have nothing to do with religion in an attempt to proselytize to people. Really I don't think it makes them look good either just that proof that they basically try to force it where it doesn't belong. But yeah I think these types of people existed before and have done this at sporting events and that's why you might see signs saying John 3:16. It's not even about sports it's just a way to promote their beliefs to others. But then you have people like the link I posted where they go to a video that is areligious and will literally try to do this. And the video I am talking about is a nature video where a monitor lizard kills baby opossums."
