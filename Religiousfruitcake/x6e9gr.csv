1,This woman is in mental agony. I genuinely pity her.
2,"OKay, I'm definitely too uneducated or something, but can somebody explain what the heck NFP means in this context?"
3,">It does get easier as you get older and menopause comes into closer view

Take a minute to think about just how bleak it is to look forward to the day you finally become infertile and no longer have to put up with regimented / ritualistic intercourse. Then take another minute to consider how bad it must be to yearn for that sterile, mechanical, sexual contact because your infertility means you are no longer sexually necessary and therefore get no sex at all."
4,"Coming from someone who has 7 siblings, if i lost my mum over another spawn I’d be very annoyed, and heartbroken. I’m so glad she’s stopped now because parents don’t understand the effect having a bunch of siblings looking up to you when your just tryna grow up yourself"
5,">Like my RCIA instructor said, if people fully understood ahead of time whatt will be asked of them few would ever convert.

No one is asking you to have 20 kids, lady."
6,Christianity is so inhumane.
7,Religion devalues life so much that people would rather die than realize it's all bullshit.
8,"Birth control is literally as easy as putting a thin rubber membrane on your dick, and she chooses to live in complete misery because the rubber membrane would make a storybook character mad? That's too sad to even make fun of."
9,[deleted]
10,Why is she looking forward to elder years if she knows she won’t make it there?
11,"They have literally been conned into pain and suffering, to continue the pain and suffering into the next generations. This is so sad, when will the mindless brainwashing end."
12,"I feel terrible for any kid forced to grow up this way. My very Catholic grandparents had 12 kids (2 lost at birth) they were poor as hell. My grandmother became a miserable wench to a select few of her kids, including my mom. The oldest kids didn't really have a childhood, they had to play mother for the youngest. All of my aunts and uncles have had life- long mental health stuggles. It's really sad,"
13,"Wow, she’s may leave the world with 7 brainwashed kids we now have to deal with."
14,r/Catholicism would be eating this post up saying how brave it is of her to sacrifice her life. Catholics are fucking insane and I’m so glad I got out of it.
15,My grandparents were very Irish Catholic and after my grandmother had her sixth c section they got special dispensation from the church to use birth control due to medical advice.
16,"Christianity doesn't care about women? That's new /s

The contraceptives and anesthetics are known since ancient times, but Catholic Church was first creation, that banned them because Bible doesn't allow it. So basically women giving birth were depraved of anesthetics, because of catholic whim, and they were forced to be pregnant each time, they had sex, until they died due to exhaustion. Catholic obsession about pregnancy, children and suffering is psychotic. The only hope is to finally erase Christianity and educate the dark masses, so they children might have a better existence."
17,"Your body can't deal with more children, if you use a condom I am sure as Hell that God will understand."
18,What a miserable existence and a waste of a perfectly good life.
19,"""Few would ever convert, but we do it anyways because we have no choice.""

Translation: we have been brainwashed since birth to subject ourselves to behavior and activities we do not agree with under the threat of eternal torture."
20,"I'm seriously gagging, I'm really going to puke.
I hope someone gives her a piece of mind.
I feel really bad for her and her children."
21,NFP causing depression?  What does she mean by that?  She got so depressed she couldn’t get a cream pie during her fertile days that she just went for it (possibly to her death)?
22,This just bums me out.
23,Not accepting that birth control is gonna be a life saver for her is something I am yet to comprehend!
24,"“Long periods of abstinence, sometimes lasting months or even years” - that’s really fucked up. I really don’t know what to say. Sucks to be a Catholic woman!"
25,A suicide pact. How charming. How noble. How disgusting.
26,"I feel a mixture of helplessness and anger every time I realize ‘yep, they got away with indoctrinating and brainwashing another person into ruining their life.’

These religions ought to be prosecuted for crimes against humanity."
27,But sex is only for making babies my religion’s thousands year old interpretation of scripture translated a million times told me so
28,"1. What is nfp
2. This is some real cult shit"
29,"Ugh, quiverfull might start becoming a trigger word. Fucking gross."
30,"I am RC. This is nuts. No one is forced into the rhythm method. Pay off? WTF os this nut talking about? If you act only to get a “pay off”, thats barter, not faith.  Ive met too many women who have kids because they want them to tolerate a weirdo who thinks it’s a duty or will “pay off” 
Only a self centered idiot would risk leaving their kids motherless. Vasectomies are just fine in the faith. This post is BS"
31,Is using protection also against catholicism..?
32,"https://news.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx

Thankfully most of them don’t follow it to extremes"
33,Wet dreams happen: sperm is not sacred. Use a bloody condom!
34,Full of Depression so she’s breeding a quiver full?  Yikes.
35,"And this is why literally zero people should be surprised that when the Catholic Church gets their way, more women die"
36,"Exactly, just from that short comment it seems like she lives a terrible life"
37,https://www.beginningcatholic.com/catholic-natural-family-planning
38,No Fuck Police
39,"I thought she was saying the opposite, that after menopause women who use NFP can finally relax and just enjoy sex purely for what it is without the concern of impregnation."
40,"So if this woman is Catholic, then the Catholic Church does not forbid postmenopausal women from having sex with their husbands. They only require that all sex is in the confines of marriage, and that it is “open to life” (aka open to pregnancy) Meaning that you can’t pull out or use any type of birth control. However the pope does say the infertile women, women with hysterectomies and the aforementioned postmenopausal women can continue having relations with their husbands

Source:not catholic, just googled it"
41,"Plus, you can only give attention and love to so many children. After that, you’re not going to have any real connection with most of them, esp as they get older. And ever the children themselves won’t all be as close most of the time, also esp with age. Outside of how financially stressful it would be on everyone, it’s also just neglectful to a degree."
42,They say suffering brings you closer to God. These people believe they are winning and will get an enteral reward for it.
43,All regions are inhumane
44,Wait till you look into Islam and  orthodox Judaism
45,"I personally believe there's some sort of nice dude that's a higher power out there, but not like Christianity. that religion and that God are pieces of shit."
46,"https://news.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx

Thankfully most are aware of it"
47,My cousin is a Medtronic engineer and his wife is their Webmaster.
48,"As long as she chooses and can take care of eight children, I don't see the issue."
49,Thank goodness!!!!
50,Delusion?
51,Trust me; it's not necessarily permanent.
52,It is taken from this glorious sub.
53,"https://news.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx

Thankfully most think rationally and put common sense over doctrine"
54,Thank god the preacher said yes!
55,What the fuck are you saying? My family is Catholic and here in Spain we don't have any issues with anesthetics.
56,Sucks to be a Catholic woman who doesn't have the sense to [dabble from the cafeteria](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cafeteria_Christianity).
57,"Natural Family Planning, or POHYDFU - Pull Out and Hope You Didn't Fuck Up"
58,"Any form of ‘I don’t want to be pregnant every time I have sex,’ is frowned on in Catholicism."
59,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbk
60,Being on the shit end of the stick usually goes that way. Just falls on women 99% of the time.
61,"But, that really is avoid pregnancy, which is anticatholic, also, telling people how to find non ferrile month days, that means they are telling how to have sex only for pleasure, which is also anticatholic. Totally anticatholic"
62,"> This is not the ""rhythm method!""

How many fucking methods do they have?"
63,"Well, some religious nut jobs believe sex should only be used for making babies and pleasure is somehow related to the Devil or some nonsense like that.

Edit: Typo"
64,"I do that already. I enjoy sex and use condoms and I’m actually happy. It’s sad that women think this can’t happen until after menopause. What makes them think their husbands will want to have sex then? They already used it for the transactional use of spreading his genes everywhere, so what makes them think it will get any better?"
65,"Don’t even get me started on finances, having kids when you can’t afford it isn’t fun for anyone involved"
66,Just look at Mother Theresa and how she treated the people she was supposed to take care of. Her number one reason for letting all those sick people suffer more was bc she believed it was what god wanted and it would bring them closer to god.
67,"If one exists and is as controlling as some people make it out to be. If not, they suffer a lot and potentially die a painful death for nothing. The more mainstream Protestant version typically doesn’t have these restrictions and some of them are pretty sure that they’re the only ones that get a good afterlife. Perhaps it’s time to get out of the 15th century."
68,"Which is why they are so desperate to paint themselves as victims. They believe if they write the narrative, this will bring them closer to God. It means they will store up more treasures in heaven."
69,If she's dead? She's not taking care of her children
70,"I think we are focusing on the fact that women face a mirage of choice, because they will be shunned within their family and community for picking the wrong thing. Choice exists on a technicality rather than freedom."
71,"No human can physically take care of 8 children to any reasonable degree. 

At least half will simp be neglected and just rely on each other. 

Raising 1 child is a massive challenge for a lot of people, for like 10-12 years 

Now imagine doing that for likely over 20 and having multiple kids to raise in many intervals, at some points likely 3-4!"
72,Of course it is. They’re fucking insane over there
73,I'm talking about Middle Ages til like XVIII/XIX century?
74,“Pull and Pray”
75,Ah one of relegions loop hole rules. Thanks for explaining it
76,lol it will never be as good as the holy grail imo!
77,"These people ignore any of their hypocrisies and throw logic out the window.

> With the body, not against it

>Although NFP is sometimes called natural contraception, alternative contraception, and even Catholic contraception, please realize that it's very different than true contraception.

>The term contraception applies to acts that deliberately impede conception — it's a refusal of fertility.
>NFP uses the female body's natural rhythm of fertility to either avoid or achieve pregnancy. This is not contracepting."
78,"Religious people have always tried to find ways to ""outwit"" their god(s) through loopholes and technicalities. 

Hell, there's an entire *industry* built around technology targeted at orthodox Jews, so they don't have to break the Sabbath by pressing a goddamn button on their goddamn microwave."
79,"IIRC all sex without the intent to conceive is considered sodomy. Congrats crazy Catholic lady, you belong in Sodom and Gomorrah."
80,"It’s fine, because it doesn’t work very well, so it’s basically bullshit. They’re tricking people into pregnancy."
81,"It’s not a contraceptive - it uses the body’s natural cycles to have sex. Reducing pregnancy isn’t inherently bad or women wouldn’t have a cycle with fluctuating fertility - in Catholic’s eyes, this cycle is created by God, and allowing God to still take the wheel but utilizing His own natural methods to hope He permits you to have less children isn’t against Catholic teachings. It’s the supposed unnatural aspect of birth control - or really any “sinful” behavior - that Catholics have a problem with. They’re really big on the natural order of things, not necessarily the production of children. Source: was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school for many years, where NFP was a frequent point of discussion"
82,It is though and it is ineffective. There is a study that found that women can ovulate more than once a month and possibly why contraception can fail.
83,It’s totally the rhythm method lol
84,I’m the oldest of seven. I only had two. I never ever saw what was so wonderful about growing up in a large family. I hated it.
85,"Mother Teresa was a sadist, and was made a Saint for it. She didn't even give dying people an aspirin. The expression, ""suffer the children to come unto me"", means allow the children.  The women's suffrage movement was a campaign to allow them to vote, not a program to accommodate masochists. Cruel maltreatment of the sick and elderly is not very Christ-like."
86,"What makes that even more infuriating is that most of those people weren't even Christian (although some were forcefully baptized while dying in unnecessary agony), so Theresa used them essentially as non-consenting human sacrifices to appease a god neither they nor she (by her own admission) believed in. 

*And people today still use that woman's name as a shorthand for ""kind and selfless person"".*"
87,"And yet when mother Teresa got sick she did not seek out ""care"" at one of her torture houses. Nope the b*tch chartered a private plane to fly her to one of  California's most advanced first class medical care hospitals with a private room and full pain management facility.

Just like every other ""compassionate"" conservative christian, suffering for my religion is for thee, not for me"
88,Mainstream Catholicism doesn't believe that.
89,"Well, having sex during non fertility days sounds quite deliberate to me"
90,My mom used the rhythm method a d insisted it was a great alternative to the pill. She has 3 kids. Worked great
91,"Yeah, i know about the jews and what they do to comply with sabbat, and is absolutely absurd"
92,outwitting God sounds like something Lucifer would do...
93,"Once upon a time, the catholic curch classified beavers as fish. That way, one could eat them during Lent, when one is supposed to avoid meat."
94,"Don’t forget the wire that runs around most of Manhattan to define it as one giant “home” for Orthodox Jews, to circumvent the taboo on using keys on certain days or some shit. I forget the details but there are good videos about it."
95,Same please share
96,"It’s laughable bc their website claims it’s 99-100% effective, while also claiming it’s not contraception bc contraception is deliberate and “refusing fertility”. You’d think we’d never made any scientific advancements with the way these people are."
97,"Same and same, I love my siblings but I don’t really like children because of them"
98,"She was definitely a sadist. She let a child die of a common, easily curable kidney infection bc they wouldn’t take him to the hospital bc “if they did it for one, they’d have to do it for all”. They reused needles on all patients, washing them in dirty water in between uses bc “there was no point” in sterilizing them. She also raised millions on the promise that it’d go to the sick who usually couldn’t afford that care, and then they never seen a cent of it. None of the people providing medical care were trained *at all*. 

Also, the whole way she became a saint is fucked. You had to cause 2 miracles for a pope to grant you sainthood. Her 2 “miracles” were two random people saying that 1. Praying to her cured her illness & 2. His wife praying to her cured his illness, and neither “illness” was provable, but they didn’t care bc it’s good publicity. 

She was an awful wretched woman. Her real name wasn’t even Theresa, she adopted that name after another saint, like an absolute narcissist lol."
99,Why do you say that she wasn't Christian?
100,"Just like the dumbass pastor who use a venomous snake during a sermon and got bit. Even tho one of the church’s policies was to not seek medical attention, he sure did, and afterwards gave a statement that they were “considering” changing it. Absolutely love that it’s all on camera for the entire internet to see lol"
