1,Ready for hell. Sounds better and better
2,"The USA needs strict protocols regarding lead in their water and pipes. As well as strong standards on what chemicals are added to their food.

If that happens they should be able to reverse the dramatic drop in IQ/brain function that has caused this amount of stupid."
3,So heaven is full of assholes.  Got it.
4,"So your telling me I can just walk out of hell?

Interesting

See ya later Satan."
5,"Heaven's strick immigration policy allows for automatic admission of rapists, child molesters, murderers, and every other type of degenerate criminal, as long as they accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior."
6,I swear this shit is pro Satan
7,"With the way Christians describe Heaven, all the cool people must be in Hell. All the rock players, Jewish comedians, the artists."
8,If humans were allowed in Heaven then it would've burned down by now.
9,Is it a gate? Thought it was the eye of a needle?
10,Trumpists say USA has open border. Do they have a quick manual how to get advantage of this because my friend from Russia can't even get a visa - embassy in Russia is closed and Warsaw has nearest appointments in 2024.
11,Satan is based
12,"So, heaven is only for judgemental jerks? 

Hell, here I come."
13,Hmm maybe they had a cardboard of trump just for fun? Cuz that sticker doesnt sound like an advertisment for whatever they call heaven
14,How would they know this? I'm really curious to see what they would come up with.
15,"Really, who told you this?

Dont say i read it in the bible bacause i read that vampires exist but i'm not moronic enough to believe it..."
16,Is the wall in the room with us right now?
17,Heaven and Hell aren't real places.
18,"But it's one way, remember that."
19,if this person is going to heaven i will happily go to hell
20,Heaven for the climate. Hell for the company.
21,"have you heard of the leaded gas theory? before the late 70s all gas had lead in it, and it wasn't completely phased out until 1996. so just being around a running car would literally kill your brain. my grandpa worked on cars his whole life and now he believes in QAnon lmfao."
22,It is not just USA. Global decline in cognitive capacity seems to be happening everywhere.
23,you'd prob walk out into purgatory and find all the catholics who paid to be there
24,"I mean, there are so many reasons why religion is bad, why invent one? This is incorrect, they would need to truly repent."
25,"Seriously, hell could feature a mega-concert featuring everyone from Hendrix to Kurt Cobain, with comedy sets from Richard Pryor and George Carlin opening the show, and backgrounds painted by Dali. Heaven . . . has a lot of harps and choirs."
26,"If humans are allowed in heaven, the angels would be critically endangered and I want to see proof those streets of gold are still there just like how people say fort Knox has no gold anymore."
27,Only if you're rich.

30,"Fun fact, lead is still in aviation fuel and the number one cause of lead pollution"
31,"All my years driving and I never considered there was once a ""leaded"" version of the ""unleaded"" petrol at the pump!"
32,Faster in the USA though.
33,Most Christian's I encounter only require you to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
34,"Ok, I'll play. This still allows for a person living their life never harming another, helping those less fortunate than themselves and still ending up in eternal hellfire because they do not believe, while allowing another who did horrific things during their life, but ""truly repented"" before the end, spend eternity in paradise. Sounds like a distinction without much of a difference to me."
35,Going to the 9th circle makes you automatically cool.
36,makes sense why all the celebs with private jets are idiots!
37,"Only Avgas still contains lead. This fuel is generally used only in small,  piston engined aircraft,  such as those which fly from small airfields. 

Of course,  still bad."
38,"Well ever since the end of ww2 America is setting the global trends :).

Joke aside I am amazed about stuff I'm reading about US these days. From rise of the christian fundamentalism, abortion bans, mass shootings to the shitty labor rights protection and lack of healthcare accessibility. The fact that somehow healthcare is tied to the employment is something I can not comprehend. It is hard to explain how much I admired US when I was growing up in the 90's. I still do for all the advances US contributed in the field of science, technology, music etc... But I assume or I would at least like to believe that these ""redneck"" practices are confined to your ""bible belt"" states. 

But I live in EU in a country where forest comprises more than 60% of the land and is heavily tick infested. Tick-borne encephalitis is a serious threat here. Vaccine is available to anyone and a lot of people around me are not afraid of the possible brain inflammation that can lead to severe disability or death, but they are afraid of 50 years old, safe and proven vaccine. Not to even mention that also in EU population had hard time understanding the links between physical barriers (masks), distance, hand sanitization and virus transmission. 
It is everywhere and getting worse. It's like we are in that movie Idiocracy."
39,And tithe
40,"Its spelled ""christian's"". With air quotes. Those are important."
41,">This still allows for a person living their life never harming another, helping those less fortunate than themselves and still ending up in eternal hellfire because they do not believe

This, to me, is much worse than

>while allowing another who did horrific things during their life, but ""truly repented"" before the end, spend eternity in paradise

Because you can't trick an all knowing being, someone who truly repents wouldn't technically be a bad person anymore. They wouldn't be admitted unless they actually realised that they were doing bad things, actually regretted them, wouldn't repeat them, and work to fix them. An all knowing being would know the difference between someone who lived their life ""in sin"" because they knew they'd just say sorry right before dying and someone who had a real change of heart.

You want bad things, look at kids who need help, but can't count on their parents because they just keep praying without doing anything, the megachurches, the cult mentality that predisposes people to being manipulated by ridiculous conspiracy theories, or the extremists who try to teach kids about things like creationism. You can also look at the subjects that are super taboo like sex ed and lgtbtq+, or discouraging education especially towards women.

Feels like there are so many bad things, that choosing the one thing that could actually bring hope to someone who thinks they are too far gone is a bit dumb."
42,Hehe icy what you did there!
43,"Oh no, someone warn the Khardasians"
44,"You have the issue backward. It's not that a bad person that is truly repentant gets forgiven. It's that a person that was never a bad person in the first place, and perhaps even a very good person, receives the same punishment as a bad person that never repents."
45,Ditto.
46,"It's what I said: that is worse, imo, than the repentant guy."
