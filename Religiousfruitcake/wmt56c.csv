1,"I don't know if sickos like this use this argument as a justification for all their crimes or they think it's ok, but it's still disgusting."
2,"Ah.  That's not the definition of a pedophile.  Any Muslims, or anyone at all for that matter, who holds this belief is not someone we want living free in any society."
3,"I used to wrap myself up in quite a web trying to justify the marriage of Aisha because I used to love honoring her as the mother of believers just like Mother Mary so to say her marriage was pedophilia really used to mess with me like no that's not possible or hey it was ancient Arabia what do you expect.  Just like this fruitcake in the example, you will use insane mental gymnastics to justify or explain away what you believe.

It was finally on this subreddit once again debating this topic someone pointed out ample evidence that child marriage was indeed not the norm around the ancient world and the truth hit me like a pile of bricks.

No, this religion is just as fictional as the others and Muhammad was a liar.

It's a tough pill to swallow but I'm glad people I used to hate pulled me out of it, 

Thanks everyone on this subbreddit"
4,"Putting aside how gross this already is, ""Prophet"" jerked off with her thighs before first menstruation, because that technically isn't sex by troglodyte's standard."
5,How do you split hairs about when itâ€™s okay to have sex with a child and not realize youâ€™re the bad guy?
6,"If the character from the book called Muhammed did it, then it's okay ðŸ¤·

And thus such people will forever be stuck within the barbaric ages. Simply accept that such actions are wrong, update the book, and at least pedophilia will no longer be supported within it"
7,"That is the correct definition of pedophilia: prepubescent.

12 year olds can marry in Massachusetts today. 

If anyone remembers Sansa in GOT, once she had her period she was ready to marry and have sex with 
Joffrey. This is very traditional in human history.

Teenagers were adults with children in any human time other than the last 80 or 90 years. 

Pedophilia is an assault against a sexually immature child. 

 Any age above puberty that society chooses as age of consent, is just a definition of statutory rape. And that is 12 and 13 in a number of countries. Japan was 13 until recently. UK age of consent is 16. In the 1800s it was 13. Most societies it was with onset of menses and at 1776, in the various American colonies it was a low of 8 in Delaware, and most were 10-12. 

Nitpicking against Mohammed seems a bigotry, singling out a religious figure for what was the norm in a different time."
8,Pedophilia is not sex with young girls!! It sex with prepubescent boys by straight men! They are usually married.
9,"Yeah, I was pretty shocked they were this transparent about it. Usually they talk about how ""things were different back then"" when the pedophilia  in their lore comes up."
10,"Exactly, she was severely abused physically as well, being beaten in many occasions by older men. Itâ€™s so disgusting. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re free and can finally see the truth."
11,"Something previously being ""traditional"" doesn't mean it was good.

Slavery was ""traditional"" too. So was not bathing. So was executing people for minor crime.

What's your defense of those?"
12,Why do people defend Islam so much?
13,"It wasn't the norm. That is nothing but a myth that people got married and had kids at the first period. Of course it did sometimes happen. More often in noble or royal families. But even then, it wasn't common. Through out almost all of human history, the average age for a first marriage or child is much closer to 20. Not the age or puberty. This is nothing but a completely false myth with no actual basis in reality."
14,Stop defending that bigot
15,"Wrong. Pedophilia is only the sexual desire for prepubescent children. Having sex with them is child abuse.
The reason we have a age of consent now is that we leanrt that under that age most children are not mature enough for sexual encounters, first because of their psyche secound because 12 year olds bodies arent ready to bear a child even if they can get pregnant. So their is higher risk of complications, even higher risk of death.
It is not a good practic and it wasnt a good practic, they just didnt care in the past or didnt know that. And those two are very bad explanations for the perfect human which we should all see as rolemodel.
So stop acting like fucking a nine year old girl was ever good practice."
16,I can only hope this is a joke about the mental gymnastics people perform to defend this crap.
17,This is a shit statement.
18,Look up the actual definition of the word before trying to defile the language that you type in. The argument you have presented is propaganda taught to you by the ignorant to make their evil actions seem okay.
19,ITT People eating up the bait with a shit covered spoon
20,Oh shit they were talking about their lore. I thought they were referring to themself as the prophet.
21,"1. Slavery was quite universal it was the earliest form of receiving a benefit for your labor. Selling your children into slavery was always an option for all classes. Men could buy their way out. It was harder for women. A difference from the New World enslavement of Africans, is the religious justification that Africans were inferior, subhuman beings determined by God to be slaves.

2. Not bathing was a practicality of whether there was available water. Bathing cultures are very ancient. Dark ages Europe found barhing to be vain glorious and ungodly, unChristian, about the earthly body, not soul.
Science and disease discovery helped end that. So, religious twaddle caused, just like the worst of slavery.

3..executing for a minor crime was because people were  vulnerable to criminals  and there was no taxpayer peovided prisons

 And, it was pretty effective for their needs. A reasonable action."
22,Because the shitlibs have pushed the narrative that religion = race/ethnicity.
23,"I do not defend Islam, I reject singling out for ridicule that which was not unusual in the world then, for a thousand years since. 

Hypocrisy, whether by a religionist or an athiest, I object to. 

There are legitimate contemporary objections to Islamic extremism, why bring up a subject that can be proven to have been SOP in most cultures of the world at the time.

Here is today.

US at its birth, age of consent was 10-11 in most states 8 in Delaware. It is 12 in Massachusettes today. Check it out. Just because many married later changes nothing about the many that married younger.

Here is feudal Europe

25,I do not fault people for the times they lived in.
26,"I agree  there are pedophiles who do not act in their attractions, and I have posted that we need a different way to differentiate the person with the compulsion who does not act because they know it is wrong, and the actors upon their predatory attraction."
27,"Theyâ€™re talking about how, according to the myth, Mohammed married a six-year-old  when he was 53 and he had sex with her when she was nine."
28,">Slavery was quite universal it was the earliest form of receiving a benefit for your labor.

Slavery was quite universal because slave owners were ignorant savages. 

Also, you're mostly talking about indentured servitude when you're referring to people willing to work for measly food and shelter, which is still immoral. 

You need to study more."
29,Literally no one thinks that middle eastern is the same as Muslim. No one. Maybe some right wing ignorants who donâ€™t know the location of their own country in a map.
30,"No they push the narrative that people who did not commit a crime should not be terrorized by right wing nut jobs that will just go off and kill innocent peopleâ€¦ remember all the violence against Sikh Americans after 9/11, or all the attacks on Asian Americans after covid started. Basically liberals arenâ€™t willing to throw away our freedom to push a racist fascist agenda on innocent people."
31,Muslims then shouldnâ€™t claim their prophet to be the perfect human being to walk on earth.
32,"Murder, torture, slavery, and raping children were just as wrong 3000 years ago(or 100,000 years ago) as they are today. The people of times past were just as human and felt the same pain and suffered just like anyone alive today that is subjected to violent acts. These acts donâ€™t become more moral the further in time or location they are from us today. They were as indefensible then as they are now, no matter how much modern religions try to argue otherwise."
33,"12 million., out of literally over a billion. And age of consent is not the age where most marriages happens. 

And again, no, it wasn't common, sorry to burst your bubble. Yes, as I said, it happened, but it is not the average age to marry of have kids. 

Literally just google ""average age of marriage and having kids for ""fill in year"" and it doesn't matter what year you put in, it will be around 20. Yes, you COULD marry and have kids younger then that, as I said, but it wasn't common."
34,"Even going all the way back to ancient fucking Rome, we have an average marriage age of 15 for girls, and 20 for men. In fucking ancient Rome. 

Yes, the legal age was lower, but it didn't happen most of the time. And early America had low ages, but again, on average, it wasn't until 20, even before America was a fucking country."
35,"People TODAY worship and are willing to die for that bigot. He may not fit in the definition of pedophile but heâ€™s a predator, how else you call a 53 year old who marries a 6 year old? Even in that time, the people around him pointed that she was too young for him."
36,Slave owners were not ignorant savages. The person who needs to study more is you.
37,"[Haha, wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COMPLETEANARCHY/comments/w9sfln/should_i_be_less_surprised_that_rjokes_is_a_safe/)"
38,"I do not get you point. Why does his relationship being within social norms make him imperfect.

I think ALL religion is bullshit. As Tom Tobbins says"" religion is not just the opiate of the people, ot is their cyanide as well"". 

But how does your comment make any sense? You would lose a street epistemology debate"
39,What ever.
40,"Average age. Do you know what average actually means? 

Are there a billion 10-12 yo NOT married?. Your number relationships are quite meaningless."
41,Average. Do you know what an AVERAGE is?
42,https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/marriage-in-judaism
43,"Muslims claim, that their prophet is the eternal guide for the mankind. Prophetâ€™s morality is timeless according to Muslim. If Muslims claim all these characteristics, then Non-Muslims will try to refute them by comparing some of the prophetâ€™s actions to the moral standards of today."
44,"You know your own source even proves you wrong, right? 

""Hindu and Muslim women have the lowest median age at first marriage (16.7 years), IndiaSpend reported earlier based on a seven-state report from Nirantar, a Delhi-based advocacy.""

Even among the Muslim and Indian girls, most aren't married for the first time until they are over 16. Now, I suppose to be fair, there are two ways they could be counting the median age, and if they are using one of them, that wouldn't mean a whole lot, but using that way would also make the least sense, so I can't imagine they are using that. 

And then, another thing not being taken in to account in these numbers is arranged marriages. Which many are arranged when the child is young. And also very commonly, the actual marriage happens, but the girl doesn't leave the family to actually be with the man until much later. It simply locks it in to place. It still isn't a good practices on any level, and isn't much better. But, it is slightly better then the girls directly going to their new husband right away. And both these types of things would be included in this number. And even still, the majority of marriages isn't to girls this young. It happens, but it is not the norm, no matter how you try to twist it."
45,"No, it isn't at all, because the average age of marriage being so far above shows that the vast majority aren't getting married at that young age. Yes it happens, but it isn't the norm, or common. Or the average would be much closer to it. 

You very clearly don't know what you are talking about here. As the vast majority of marriages aren't to children this young, and never were. And that is the point. But thank you for showing us you just want to defend child molestation."
46,"Yes, and it is very clearly you that doesn't. It is was common, or even normal, the average would be far closer to the lower. But keep showing us just how stupid you are."
47,Tf is that supposed to be?
48,First blood is the time. Whybdo you need to rewrite history?
49,I showed you research. Why is it so important to you? Why do you ignore what even the 13 colonies acceptable ages means? It was acceptable. Normative.
50,"Marriage was allowed under 10. Recommended waiting til.12 for consummation. But there was a lot of ""whatever"" in Hebrew rules current to the times.

Could marry independently as adults 12 for females, 13 for males.

It is a long read, but it gets down to it. 

Although today, Rabbis support 18 year olds for marriage. I think the independence of newlyweds today vs the ""live with the family"" of older times makes the difference. Signing contracts,, etc.. 

We are a different society. In older times, if a child was less than perfect or unwanted, one could leave the in the woods or launch into the sea.

Hansel and Gretel was the story of abandoned children.

History did not start in 1950."
51,"It is you trying to rewrite history. As I said, simple Google when most got married at any time. Even going back to ancient Rome, it is 15. And most of the rest of history it is closer to 20. Marrying at first blood is a myth that didn't regularly happen. Sure, there are cases where it did,  UT it isn't the norm or common. Most were closer to 20 when they first got married, through out almost all of history. Just be abuse you want to justify child molestation doesn't change history as you'd like it to be."
52,"You showed what the lowest age of consent was. Something I never argued against. I proved to you that despite the age of consent being that low, that it still wasn't the norm or common for people to marry that young. The point it, while legal, and while it did happen, it wasn't common nor the norm. And so, there is no excuse for what he did, even then it was considered extreme. It is that simple. 

And no, be abuse the law allowed it does not mean it was acceptable le or normal. Or far more marriages would have happened at those ages, which they did not."
53,"Yeah, Iâ€™m aware of deranged behavior being acceptable and even rewarded in the past. Look, if youâ€™re attracted to minors, you should go to therapy, not try to defend it to some stranger on reddit."
54,God is you.
