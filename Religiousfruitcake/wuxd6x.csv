1,Doesn't apply to anything I ever say. My entire argument against any religion is the complete and total lack of objectively verifiable evidence.
2,"I'm not specifically an islamaphobe, I'm an all inclusive religiophobe."
3,"1. Ask anyone living in an Islamic country and they'll tell you how bad Islamic terrorism is. 

2. I'm pretty sure Aisha was just mature for her age.

3. All religions are death cults. 

4. See point 1.

5. I wouldn't trust someone who actually thinks Satan or Allah exists. 

6. What book do they use to justify those honor killings again? Clifford the Big Red Dog?

7. What about goats?

8. That's not an argument

9. Also not an argument

10. There is no such thing as a religion of peace, they've all decided to wage holy war for their sky daddies at some point."
4,"Criticizing Islam. Usual reply: Your religion (and atheism) is worse than mine. In fact, your religion/atheism is blah blah blah - shifting focus to another religion/atheism and talking about it exclusively to keep the conversation away from Islam."
5,Don‚Äôt sell yourself short. You also treat women like property.
6,*Arguments*
7,"Don't forget ""Bring evidence if you're truthful"". That is my usual go to whenever someone tries to convince me Muhammad flew to heaven and split the moon."
8,motherfucker be listing arguments without explaining how they are not valid‚Ä¶ fucking moron
9,Most of it. Lol
10,"Same imo religion is fucking stupid, like yall mofos believe in mystic energy and old ass books? Then yall CENTER YOUR LIFE AROUND IT!?! WHY!?"
11,Aisha was literally 9
12,Christianity is an institution that has had many reforms and the faith is slowly declining into more of a mythology in the west I can only assume this is bc people find a good deal of it's following and practices distasteful which is fair enough... just dont apply that same logic to other religions or recommend they make any sort of reformation. that would be narrow minded
13,"The goats is more just racist than Islamophobic. Calling Arabs ""goatfuckers"" is the common racist comment to make against them."
14,Well I live in an Islamic country and we don't have terrorism here üëç
15,I AM a woman
16,And yet they still defend that shit. Imagine someone defending one of the many abuser priests with that logic.
17,I was speaking to the person who created the list. They missed one. They also treat women poorly. Not trying to be a jerk but I guess that went right over your head.
18,"More and more they're trying to retcon her to 19.  I guarantee it's only a matter of time until all Muslims are on board.  There are still some holdouts though. 

If the world one day figures it's shit out and pedophilia is equally vilified everywhere on the planet, in every culture, I'm sure religion will have to move on with the times as well."
19,Oh. I get it now!
20,Haha I was on your side the whole time
21,Yeah üòÖ
