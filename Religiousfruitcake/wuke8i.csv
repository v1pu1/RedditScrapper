1,"The devil is offering a sound education.

Edit - clarification"
2,"Lucifer sounds much better. 

HAIL SATAN!"
3,"""obey"" is this where this obsession with authoritarian leaders stems from?"
4,"The Simpsons had that one Treehouse of Horror episode where Bart went to school in Hell and they gave him an amazing education that helped better him as a person in a way that appealed to him.  Fuck, guess that show really _does_ predict everythingâ€¦"
5,interesting... does the devil have a youtube channel with some content? or maybe some online course link to check out?
6,"I get why they hate evolution, but wtf is wrong with psychology?"
7,"I knew it! Hell is just high school all over again with exams,  homework, and not being able to use the restroom.

Devil with red hot pirchfork: Again Timmy, what is the powerhouse of the cell?"
8,r/goodguysatan
9,Not psychology! The horror!
10,"This must be satire, right? RIGHT???"
11,"All I gotta say is ""bow.. chicka wow wow""."
12,And you donâ€™t even have to pay! All u have to do is disobey Jesus
13,1000% times better ciriculum to private christian schools
14,Obey Jesus as in give your possessions to the poor? Got it.
15,"My parent's Facebook friend posted something similar once, and my christian dad commented something like ""sounds great! Education is a good thing"""
16,This is why I love Satan. The voice of reason.
17,"They could have shortened the sign and just wrote ""science."""
18,Hail Satan
19,The devil sounds like a great guy
20,"If you donâ€™t indoctrinate your children, theyâ€™ll become educatedðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±"
21,"Well shit looks like my degree in psychology is because of the devil and so is my interest in science. 

I'm sorry my education offends your existence as a  religious person. /S"
22,..and other big words that make me uncomfortable because I doesn't understand 'em.
23,"Wow, psychology?

That's a new one."
24,"Damn, evolution class with Satan sounds super cool."
25,"Heaven forbid a child to learn how the brain works, what happens from trauma, mental illness or anything else that does with psychology, BUT it's ok for them to learn that plus how to do med dosages and a bit more with psychiatry"
26,"Damn, hes offering to teach people to be DJs as well?"
27,Hail Satan
28,HAIL SATAN
29,Praise Satan! (Insert video here of the guys who tossed a bible in a fire at a book burning yelling Hail Satan repeatedly)
30,"I honestly think it does. There's an interesting documentary series (4 episodes) on Netflix call ""Keep Sweet Pray and Obey"" which takes a very interesting look at the ""obey"" culture and just how terrible it can get."
31,"It exposes a lot of the [cognitive distortions](https://www.psychologytools.com/articles/unhelpful-thinking-styles-cognitive-distortions-in-cbt/) often used in religious thinking and arguments. Critical Thinking is the enemy of a lot of religious narratives. For example, once I explained confirmation bias to my husband he had an existential crisis that ultimately led to him leaving christianity."
32,Psychology also rightly asserts that homosexuality and gender identity are not mental defects/perversions as some would claim.
33,Haha! As someone who was homeschool this sounds pretty good
34,Subbed and posted! Thanks for a new community ðŸ˜Š
35,"Oh no! I've got an honours degree in psychology!!! Now I can identify confirmation bias, recognise coercion and I know the difference between the peripheral and central route of persuasion!!!"
36,I don't know but it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't. Came from a family where all three were frowned upon at a time and they would 100% agree with every word written here.
37,"Sadly in my experience not at all. I come from a family where psychology was seen as the work of the devil. Jokes on them, guess who has an honours degree in psychology! Luckily I watch the same people grow beyond such idiocy. In my personal experience, there's a lot of fear of the unknown."
38,I'll see if I have it on my local Netflix. (We don't get all the same stuff around the world)
39,omg i love conformation bias itâ€™s my superweapon against christians who still havenâ€™t got a fried brain
40,Purge this evil being of Satan
41,Apparently you are an agent of sanity... Oops. I mean Baphomet.
42,"Yeah, it's really frustrating how people do that.

Especially since science is one of those things that seems archaic and unknown at first, but then you actually learn about it and you're like ""wow, that's way simpler than I thought!"".

But alas, most people simply lack the drive to go find out about it."
43,I'm in Australia and we have it but I totally relate to the dilemma
44,An agent of Satan's Sanity if you will
