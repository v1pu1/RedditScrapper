1,That's _terms and conditions_ apply. Always read fine print.
2,"…”it would be better for you not to have been born.” Then why put us here in the first place? Just to see us suffer?

C’mon, man."
3,Yeah the best and truest kind of love is the kind where you're tortured if you don't reciprocate.
4,"Ah yes, Yahweh the Yandere."
5,And this is how they groom people to accept narcissistic abuse. This.
6,Is that a fucking threat?
7,"Why is it always John, Luke or James? Why doesn’t god ever credit himself?"
8,"""Add 30% not 30 cents""


 just cuz?"
9,"Damn, if that’s the case then you guys should’ve let my mom have an abortion…shame on you!"
10,“Unconditional love”
11,"To quote the Lady Gaga, ""I don't know what love is."""
12,"During pride month at my workplace, there was a family that came in with stuff about how God made rainbows to give Noah hope and the homosexuals stole it for their sinful pride. Keep in mind that at my workplace a good half of our workforce identifies as LGBTQ+."

14,"god loves you, BUT"
15,Booooring. Chick Tracts are much funnier.
16,Everything that comes before a but is bullshit
17,"""it would be better for you not to have been born""

But god knew that I would reject his love, with his omniscience? Yet didn't stop me from existing or didn't change me to love him with his omnipotence? Clearly wanted me to suffer his punishment, that he knew I'd get. Weird. Might not be a benevolent god at all. Or, hear me out, he might not be real."
18,"...

But..."
19,"""Jesus loves you*


*points gun at your head*"
20,"""Better for you not to have been born"" sounds a lot like a fundie making an argument *for* why they *shouldn't* oppose abortion, just sayin'..."
21,God’s always been a narcissist.
22,"Here's a random yet tangentially related meme I found earlier:

23,Appears so
24,God: They’re my PR people! The Pastoral Posse! The God Squad!
25,Checkmate!
26,"""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."""
27,"time for a mini-rant! Wouldn’t it be better for Christians if Christians encouraged abortion but themselves not abort? Since Christian and atheist views are usually taught by their parents, wouldn’t more kids being taught Christianity be better for them?"
