1,Good. Get all the religious whackos off the planet and the rest of us can fix the colossal mess they've made of the world for the last 2000+ years. Good riddance.
2,Itâ€™s coming second Tuesday of next week. Promise.
3,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_dates\_predicted\_for\_apocalyptic\_events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events)  


And on and on it goes."
4,I really wish they would just self-rapture already.
5,Its gonna happen as soon as the irs is done with their audit.
6,"Jesus was pretty clear that he would return within the lifetime of his own disciples.

So...um...any day now, I guess?"
7,Been saying that for 2k years. Get a new catchphrase
8,The apocamix nooooo wait which one I lost count after 06.
9,"Christianity is an apocalyptic religion so the end has been coming for over 2,000 years."
10,Y'all can chill. I'm in no hurry.
11,"""Get Ready,""  Like, do I need to pack something?"
12,"And yet, they think that scoffers and mockers are a sign of the end times and not a consequence of crap like that."
13,"Lmfao 64 billion seconds of ""any second now""."
14,Weâ€™ve been watching it since forever. I begin to doubt.
15,Wish theyâ€™d stop fucking with us and just DO IT ALREADY!!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
16,"Ah! But I didn't say how many final seconds! We are watching the final quintillion seconds. Checkmate, unbeliever."
17,Not again Mr. Camping
18,Lol. They've been counting those last few seconds for centuries now. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
19,the original nothing burger.
20,"World's longest running game of ""moving the goalposts""."
21,ITâ€™S THE FUCKING SUNSET LIGHT!
22,"This shit has been said for how fucking long now, even Jesus said it and hey look nothing. 

Yall gonna wait till you die of old age"
23,"Sure go rapture, we need less Christian fanatics in this world"
24,I think the closest is environmental catastrophe but they somehow denies it.
25,"Right, been ready for them to leave"
26,if only. even if you are religious the rapture as I understand is generally a modern addition to the evangelical branch of the faith probably to frighten children.
27,Dibs on Creflo Dollar's Bentley!
28,Thursday.  You Last-Tuesdayists are wrong again.
29,They seem to be getting more frequent.
30,"If you hear of them making plans, let me know. OTM calls on flavor-aid will print..."
31,"Where do you think Mel Brooks came up with the idea for ""the 2000 year old man""?"
32,"Yep. Christians have always thought they were living in the end times. Early Christians thought Nero was the antichrist. When Jesus said he was coming back, many at the time thought it was happening in their lifetime. And here we are 2000 years later...."
33,"Thanks,  Big G!!"
34,"Well, if you have pets, you need to find an atheist or non-Christian to take care of them after the rapture."
35,Actually more then 2 millenia.
36,"Second Tuesday, second Thursday-- tomato, tomahto, six of one, half a dozen of another. 

They've been saying ""any day now"" for over 2000 years. Don't hold your breath, folks!! You'll pass out!!"
37,"More people, more fruitcakes"
38,ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
39,"Wait, I am an atheist.  Is this a problem?"
40,Heathen!
41,"Oh no, then you're good, no need to pack anything. We won't be going anywhere :)  Maybe you could offer your services to Christians with pets instead?"
42,I could offer to buy their homes for 10 cents on the dollar.  They won't be needing them in heaven right?  They could have a blast before the rapture and I'd get cheap real estate.  Only way I'd lose is if the rapture actually happened.  I think I may risk it.
