1,"I know a bunch of out of shape, Netflix watching, cell phone addicted, fat Christians‚Ä¶ what is this post trying to say?"
2,I love that they‚Äôre not willing to spell ‚Äúporn‚Äù correctly
3,"It‚Äôs crazy Because there‚Äôs a lot of religious people who do all of these things

It‚Äôs hypocrisy at its finest"
4,Pornhub profits a great deal from pent up Christians
5,"At least these are my own choices, not someone else telling me what to do. So yeah it is better."
6,The only slave driver on my Switch is that Tom Nook.
7,*Me worshiping burger*
8,Soooo all the things xtians like as well?
9,"So basically

""I am a slave so you are too!!1!""

atleast they admit it"
10,Why do they always insist on using pictures like this when they are almost always more reflective of the conservative base than liberal/left?
11,"Everything in moderation. If you're indeed addicted to any of these things, then that's not good, but one could argue that these come with a lot less institutional brainwashing."
12,"Lmao we know good church goin Christians NEVER partake in porn, cheese burgers or drugs. Not once has that ever happened in the history of ever. Their only vice is the high they get from our lord and savior jesus christ. Lol"
13,Says the guy on Twitter
14,Toxic memes
15,religious people never engage in any of that.. *right?*
16,"Oddly enough, rates of religiosity in the west map on almost perfectly with obesity.

But this is aside from the point that religions are false. They have no evidence or logic that backs up their claims.

So it wouldn't matter either way."
17,I‚Äôm slave to tuktok and netix and porhob and nintedo sitch and veed
18,Enjoying anything is slavery. Obvi
19,"I love how Christian ‚Äúartists‚Äù always draw atheists as ugly wrecks of people, while Christians are drawn as attractive, comparatively speaking. Sure, teach your kids that all good looking people are Christians. I don‚Äôt see that ever backfiring."
20,Religious people do all that too.
21,I guess we are all slaves to eating food.  Only the breatheairians are free :)
22,Am slave to chicken borgar. Reject red meat borgar.
23,"What? These things are indeed not a slavery, what is this guy trying to say?"
24,"Yes, I am a slave to making sure I'm still viable for procreation, eating food, relaxing by exploring different worlds/ideas, connecting with other humans, relaxing by exploring different worlds/ideas in a different way, and the potential of medicine. 

Much better than being a literal slave under threat of eternal punishment from a figment of my imagination."
25,"Ah yes, the classic ‚Äúif you‚Äôre right then why did I draw an ugly character?‚Äù argument."
26,"Why does that switch have to have obviously fake graphics on it? You can just get a picture of a switch turned off, or even find one with an actual game playing on it."
27,Religion is advertising.
28,This guy's life looks FUCKING GREAT
29,Why does this dude look like a youth pastor?
30,"Baaaarb those Burgers are my personal stash, *shouts* THIS IS A ONE BURGER PER PERSON PICNIC"
31,"Christians are big on guilt trips, if it feels good it's got to be a sin."
32,im a slave to bur ger
33,"The religious are called a ""flock"" for a reason."
34,Borger overlord üôå
35,"Not that I totally agree but there‚Äôs quite a bit of death, destruction, waste and corruption money swirling around the global beef industry."
36,Hardcore projection happening here.
37,It's so easy to draw people you hate as ugly as possible
38,"How insane is it to actually indulge in things that you enjoy? Religion is pain and restriction for the sake of control over the masses. And for that reason, I'm out."
39,"Last time I checked, PornHub, TikTok, burgers, weed, Reddit, and the Nintendo Switch weren't trying to take away my bodily autonomy, stop people from getting married, or send people to horrific instititions to ""correct"" their sexual orientation/gender identity, and most of those (TikTok excluded) aren't harbouring paedophiles. And generally when those things ask me for money I recieve a service I asked for in return."
40,This is capitalism. Christians engage in it too. So they doubled down on being slaves?
41,Whatever! And now if you‚Äôll excuse me I‚Äôm going to wank to Pronhub.
42,Mmmm yummy burger
43,The almighty burger actually feeds the hungry.
44,no one is trying to force people to do any of the above
45,We'll never reach these idiots if they think all of us are using TikTok while high as a kite.
46,Imagine thinking fucking self control is tied to religion. lol.
47,Everything else I understand but the burger doesn‚Äôt make sense. You have to eat
48,"They probably don't want to bring up the subject of slavery if they believe so much in the Bible . . .

20 ‚ÄúWhen a slaveowner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished. 21 But if the slave survives a day or two, there is no punishment, for the slave is the owner‚Äôs property.(K)"
49,Christian don‚Äôt eat burgers
50,Pretty sure it's meant to represent a non meat burger. Because communism is when vegetables.
51,Better those than religion.
52,"At least I can prove that burgers, weed, and pornhub actually exist"
53,Because only atheists use tiktok??
54,So edgy
55,‚ÄúYou are a slave to the things that you like and that make you happy. If you were religious you could be a slave to things that don‚Äôt make you happy‚Äù - these clowns
56,Literally none of those things is a belief system that causes oppression and segregation.
57,"Humans need to metabolize carbohydrates, proteins, chemical compounds and so forth or they will die. 

Humans locked in a room with no sensory stimuli quickly go insane. Electronic entertainment is an efficient way of delivering effective stimuli to humans.

Theists routinely eat food, use electronic entertainment and ingest mind altering chemicals, indeed Christianity explicitly allows and many sects place holy significance on the consumption of beverages containing Ethanol."
58,"The existence of fast food has enslaved the minds of millions into a lower quality lifestyle to their detriment. Fast food isn't ""wrong"" or ""evil"" but it is destructive and parasitic."
59,Are they wrong tho
60,"Damn, they got me with the Switch. I haven't played on it since sometime before Xmas, but I own one, so I accept my judgement.

BTW, does anyone know who the dude depicted is, and why people worship him? He kinda looks like a meth addict, except with better teeth?"
61,"Exactly!  Watching videos, playing games, getting high, eating delicious foods, In other words, minding my own fucking business and not trying to stomp on someone else's rights because my phony baloney god told me to."
62,How in the hell did they get that picture of my Uncle Charlie?
63,"Nothing wrong with the green stuff tho, as long as you keep it in control."
64,"Who doesn't love pron and weed?

The other stuff, I do without."
65,"I mean I‚Äôm atheist and all that but this is kinda based. Most of those products have billions of dollars worth of tech, engineers, marketers and etc working to create habit forming experiences"
66,I actually kind of agree on this one. I really hope this sub isn‚Äôt going to r/atheism levels of neckbeard edgelord stuff. I just wanna make fun of the bad religious people that are homophobic and stuff.
67,I‚Äôm about to light a fat J and order a borgar
68,Take out tiktok and we got ourselves a good ole fashion Infinite Jest four day weekend.
69,I see this person has never worked at a restaurant that gets hit by the after church crowd on Sundays. They're eating a *lot* of burgers and unhealthy food in general.
70,Hamburger told me hate vegans
71,All those things are the same as religion.What the problem is?
72,"I was, ironically, a fat video game addict when I was religious."
73,Sounds like a great night!
74,Yup.
75,Religious and conservatives are all about making false comparisons.
76,At least weed is real
77,That meme looks like a good time to me.
78,"Take this as a sign that you need to be smarter than some teenager who says Christianity is ""literally slavery"". Call it what it is, not something that the Bible approves of & was used to justify, and something that many Christians are kinda ambivalent about."
79,"Pure truth. These days I was almost condemned to eternal fire for not wanting to watch porn while eating a hamburger.

Hey, you who don't smoke weed. Get ready, our smoker Bob Marley is coming back! Go smoke weed, you sinner!!!!"
80,I‚Äôm 100% a slave to my week-old Switch
81,"Fine, you win. I'll stop eating meat"
82,Some of us do make this stuff look addicting lol
83,I'm also slave to borgar
84,"Literally none of these things require you to act in a specific way, nor do they prescribe endless torture or other retribution for failure to adhere to the standards."
85,"If you enjoy it, it is sin."
86,"A man chooses, a slave obeys"
87,I...I am a slave to borgar. They got me there
88,Not right but not wrong. Religious people do these stuff too.
89,Isn't BibleIllustrated the Orthodox Christian who runs a YT channel called Pencils and Prayer Ropes?
90,Who doesnt love Pron hub?
91,"First, I think I saw that dude in the Jan 6 footage. 

Next, none of this ""sin"" is terrible and this post seems to be a way for overly-righteous religious boobs to tell people, ""Hey, I have tried these things but I'm in control. I just read the Bible afterwards and God helps me come back to the flock.""

If you're spending all your free time on PronHub, that's a sign of a problem. And if you're spending all your free time praying and reading the Bible, that's another sign of a problem. Maybe be a good person and also experience the wide spectrum of experiences available to humans. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or a Steelers fan - you'll have a big cohort, and lots of other people have low opinions of your fandom. Just don't use it to make yourself feel better than your fellow humans. Most of us could not possibly care less."
92,"The guy also tweeted this: ""Right to abortion is not ""deciding for your body."" Choosing to have sex is ""deciding for your body."" Once pregnant, it is not ""deciding for your body"" anymore, it is deciding for another person's body as well. (Before you go 'but rape' - it's far less than 1% of conceptions)"""
93,As if fruitcakes have never used at least 2 of the 6 things on the list. Also notice they didn't include Twitter or Facebook on the list to avoid a full self burn.
94,"Well, I do love me some cheeseburgers and I like my switch."
95,At least my gods there deliver on their promises.
96,I like to imagine these people are as physically ugly as their illustrations.
97,Slave to hamborgor and pronhub üòî
98,"They make a valid point tbh.

Said as an atheist that thinks lots of atheists are hella cringe"
99,Nintendo never told me to persecute gay and trans people or behead a heretic. Neither did fast food for that matter.
100,"Well fuck you Switch, i guess."
