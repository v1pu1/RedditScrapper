1,"How is this family thing even factor in god's case?

He is all powerful, he could just make the sin disappear. But rather he decides to kill everyone. What a just god."
2,"He also commanded the killing of the infants and children of the Amalekites, ruined the life of his follower Job, and the hardening of the Pharaoh's heart and then unleashing a plague on Egypt

So it isn't just the flooding."
3,"It’s irritating talking to Christians and Jews about this.


If I was to flood the world with some super villain invention, I’m the bad guy.


But if God was to do it, it’s okay.


Your pretty much admitting at this point that subjective morality exists and it’s destroys any argument you have that morality comes from god."
4,What. You are pro genoside yet flip your shit at abortion. Aren't you bringing even more sinners in to the world then. The fuck is this logic
5,Pro-Genocide Dude Laments World Drenched in Sin
6,Genocide isn't inherently evil- what a garbage take that is. I'm not even going to get into how wrong this take is.
7,Sounds like a MAGA Neo-Nazi
8,"He flooded the world to get rid of sin, he blasted entire cities to get rid of sin, he killed thousands of babies to get rid of sin, he killed his only son to get rid of sin.  Repeating the same behaviors over and over again, but expecting a different outcome is a clear sign of insanity.  Just saying.  Oh yah, and according to him, he's gonna try it one more time."
9,Im pretty sure there isnt even enough water in the world to cause ‘worldwide flood’
10,Ehm.. “thou shall not kill” much ?
11,"Yeah exactly. If God is God, then humans and their puny fights are no threat lol. “God was just  taking a ’kill them before they kill me’ approach” is such a joke."
12,">So it isn't just the flooding.

I love this so much"
13,Doesn't that also describe the plot to Taxi Driver?
14,"Nope!  Add to that:

- we should see a shallowly-buried thin layer of marine sediment at about the same depth everywhere in the world (including mountaintops); that's not what we observe
- Most fish, and probably cetaceans, are _very_ sensitive to large changes in salinity and pH.  This, we should have seen a severe evolutionary bottleneck between fish fossils and modern fish.  We don't (especially coelacanths and sharks).
- That much water pushing down on continental plates and lubricating faults would probably cause a lot of exciting seismicity, leading to tsunamis with swells that would easily crush a modern well-engineered craft, let alone a wooden vessel."
15,"I'm embarrassed to say that it's been so long since I've seen Taxi Driver that I don't remember. And, frankly, it's not my favorite Scorsese film."
16,"Not only a fish there would be a bottleneck in pretty much everything

The only reasonable explanation is all that water is god’s piss"
