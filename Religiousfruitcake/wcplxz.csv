1,Well for all its worth I'd rather rather follow satan than god. At least he's not a hypocritical dipshit and knows what he wants.
2,"The Christian version of ""everything I don't like is Hitler"""
3,America would probably be a better place if Satan was running It.
4,"This using their god for vain political purposes, a major sin."
5,"Nah, he's actually more of a Libertarian."
6,I don't think he is though. Satan would be doing a lot more to push back against Christofascism. His record is pretty strong on that shit.
7,"I'm gonna need to to cite your sources, lady. I don't remember that part of the Bible..."
8,Ain't no party like the Democratic Party  'cause the Democratic Party's got Satan!
9,"Satan, from the Hebrew word for adversary. So technically anyone can be satan to somebody."
10,Does this mean satan is a roman catholic?
11,I didn't know Donald Trump switched parties.
12,"Good morning. If I can call your attention to satan, who is everywhere I point, then no one will notice my cloven-hooves. 

Happy Sunday."
13,"Friendly reminder that, if Satan was the one who tempted Eve, then that would make him more honest than the Republican god.

Have a nice day."
14,“Good morning everyone and Hail Satan!”
15,What about to tge other 98% of the population? No good morning?
16,Satan would do a better job at leading the democratic party
17,Omg well good morning to you too! How sweet.
18,I'm not gonna disagree but I think we have different reasons for it lol
19,I wish. 🙏
20,God hating my opposed political party will never not be funny.
21,And everyone she likes is Santa.
22,"It's true, I was the satan"
23,"He does? Seems like he'd have them be a bit more forceful. They let the Republicans walk all over them.

I don't think Satan would have had them let a supreme court pick get stolen."
24,Real Christians don't use social platforms..
25,"""Something I don't like"" = communism/satanism/wokeism/transgenda

So sick of these clowns."
26,Both parties are Satan. They ain't wrong 🤷🏽‍♀️
27,Leaving that stumble bum Beelzebub to run the GOP.
28,755 LIKES?!??
29,Hail Satan!
30,In all fairness I call most GoP members Nazis.
31,BROCOLLI IS THE DEVILS TREE - christians (probably)
32,"Anytime someone brings up satan I can't help but chuckle, believing in satan is so extremely silly. 


I mean, I can respect people's beliefs to a certain extent, but if you believe satan is actually real you belong in a mental institute."
33,"hey guys, Satan here. I run the Democrats, and I confirm that I live in a blue state.

ngl man, The Big Man Upstairs is a douche.

\-Satan, on his Reddit account

>!/s!<"
34,Both parties are run by satan
35,"Well, at least Hitler is running the democratic party. I'll take the morning star over Hitler, thanx!"
36,Republicans and Democrats are agents of the Antichrist and Satan
37,"Yeah yeah, this fictional asshole is better than the other fictional asshole.  Besides, the only reason to follow satan is the music.  No other reason is needed.  

Religious people are doing everything they can to destroy the separation of church and state.  They've never stopped and they never will.  They want to take over the entire country with their religion.  They're quite clear about it.  

Summary of post:

""Our god is with our political party, our devil is with the other political party.""  It really can't get any clearer that their religion is currently influencing our politics."
38,"""Rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, the sinners have much more fun"""
39,"Satan only killed 10 people in the Bible. God killed hundreds of thousands. 

Who's the villain?"
40,"\*abusive, narcissistic, jealous, psychotic, hypocritical dipshit    


FTFY"
41,Well said...HITLER!
42,Well yeah they can’t say the democrats are Hitler anymore. Too many on their side like Hitler now.
43,"If we go by the popular Christian interpretation that the Serpent in the Garden was in fact Satan (something that's clearly not true, but let's pretend it is), Satan exposed God's lies, freed humanity from his tyranny, and gave us morality, critical thought and free will. Those are good values."
44,Agreed
45,Don't know. I think he might be good with a perversion of Christianity that drives people away.
46,I think it's somewhere in the book of armorments...
47,"I mean, that's what protestants already believe anyway. Been that way since Martin Luther."
48,Tru dat
49,She has 37k followers.
50,"I started playing A Dangerous Meeting and Satan himself materialized in front of me, he says he wants to jam."
51,MEIN GOTT
52,"Killed fewer people, too.

Oh, and if he is torturing people in hell, surely they believe he's only torturing those who deserve it, ie doing God's work, which would make him an agent of God and a good guy. Very twisted thinking."
53,"The greatest trick that god ever pulled was convincing the world that he isnt a degenerate, sociopathic megalomaniac.

...But as all gods are created by humanity, he obviously turned out just like it's creators..."
54,"True. In the UK we have our annual anti-catholic celebration on the 5th of November, some areas even goes as far as burning effigies of the pope"
55,"I do. Come on, Ancalagoth, I wanna jam!"
