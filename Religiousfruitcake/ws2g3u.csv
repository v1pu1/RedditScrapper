Yes, drop that stupid religion of yours."
6,Dammitâ€¦ Some Muslims reject 17 Sahih Hadiths about Aisha being young as 6 years when married off to the prophet of Islam.
7,First take a break from all religious anything. Let you body sweat out the religion. It takes a few weekâ€™s. The with drawl from religion is the same as opioid withdraw. Start your 12 steps. Make a list of all people you have tried to push into your religion. Then go say your sorry. Repeat next day.
