In fact, forget heaven."
9,"Dang, I'm five of those!

Bible hater, Self lover, Potty mouth, Homosexual, and LGBT supporter.

But it's not as if I would've wanted to spend eternity with a bunch of egotistical, sexist, hypocritical, bigoted, lying homophobic Fundagelicals in the first place."
10,"I actually agree with him.  None of those people enter heaven.

Of course, I'm an atheist, so he won't like the reason I agree with him."
