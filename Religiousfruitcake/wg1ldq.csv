1,I might be ok with it tbh because once all the Christians realize they're from a thousand different sects then they'll start their endless in fighting until they realize that since they can't play nicely together that the secular state is better. This might be a big ask for the muppets who still believes in sky daddies.
2,Some Catholics love to LARP as if they're living in a medieval fantasy world and long for the days when our lives were ruled by an inbred family of royal assholes claiming to be \~divinely chosen.\~ It's fucking weird.
3,"Haha, good luck instituting mandatory meatless Fridays only to be called ""woke papists"" by the Pentecostals."
4,Minority rule has been republicans’ action plan for over 20 years now at least.
5,"Last I remember, that’s exactly what people don’t want. Perhaps it could lead to a bigger decline in Christianity?"
6,Lol these catholics be dreaming
7,It's not satire.
8,"No, many of them mean this. 

It's the most unbiblical way of thinking, but they're drunk with the idea of power, not god."
9,"There used to be great animus between sects, especially Prot and Cath. Then conservatives cynically weaponized opposition to abortion in order to unite Christians to be on the same side. Because to politicians, at least of that era, it wasn't about protecting life it was about scoring points using arguments from feelings."
10,Fuck Falwell Snr and his moral majority. Fuck Ronnie Reagan for enabling him.
11,"Kinda similar in my country. The many evangelical denominations don't go along as much, but they are united in their hate against ""gEnDeR iDeOlOgY""."
