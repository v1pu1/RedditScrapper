1,I prayed to god for some forgiveness and then I had a satisfying fat shit cleary god has forgiven me?
2,"Hallalujah, praise JEEE-sus.  I prayed my momma would get better from cancer.  She died and I realized the Lord works in mysterious ways.  And now my momma is in a better place.  But then I prayed that the Lord would cause a rainbow to appear when it rained and the sun was low in the sky and behold a miracle!"
3,"Taking back the rainbow in the name of Jesus, because apparently he is too impotent to do it himself. Or too busy giving AIDs to children in Africa."
4,Queer people are so powerful they stole the rainbow from GOD.
5,"Why didn't it happen immediately? Oh, that's right. God has a really long to-do list of finding lost car keys and making sure Karen has just enough milk to finish her baking."
6,Wait. Rain happened with an unspecified number of days after a meditation sesion. Must be connected. Rainbows never happen.
7,You said words and then saw a rainbow a few days later? Must be god.
8,"""I asked asked god to approve gay sex, then the next day I had the best gay sex ever and shot the biggest load ever. Clearly, god approved. Thank you God so much!!!🙏🙏🙏"""

10,"It's funny to me that they care so much about the rainbow. The ""God's promise"" part is the odd part. Their god: ""I promise not to murder EVERYTHING on the planet again. Murdering everything instead of getting rid of the bad people was the best choice. So, when you see a rainbow, remember that I murdered everything.""

LGBTQ+ use it as a symbol of togetherness and Christians use it as a symbol of murder."
11,can these guys see a rainbow and not get filled with hate?
12,"Shouldn’t it have been, “In Noah’s name?”

Typical “Christians” don’t even know their own mythology."
13,"It’s weather events jackass, and it belongs to no one"
14,So either Hawaii's holy as hell or queer as fuck? I vote for the LGBTQ. Mahu one- God zero.
15,It rained a few days later?
16,"My god, when will these idiots understand. God made the Rainbow to show his support lgbtq. See the difference between my Christian Church and there Christian church. Just want till the republicans win and 1000 different Christian churches decide the laws.  Churches will be shooting each other in the name of God Lolololo"
17,"A few days later? Ya know... you were going to see a rainbow sooner or later. They ain't that rare, bud."
18,"How can one *truly* possess an arc of spectral colors, usually identified as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, that appears in the sky opposite the sun as a result of the refractive dispersion of sunlight in drops of rain or mist?"
19,"what does ""takine back"" mean in this case?

This is just a fucking natural light show ..."
20,What arrogance.
21,I prayed to god that it would rain and after like a few days later it rained! God exists!! /s
22,"Welp, ya got us, Fundagelicals.

We LGBTs all got together and had a HUGE meeting where the only item on our ""agenda"" was: What can we do to ruin Fundagelicals' lives?

Stealing the rainbow won by unanimous vote.

And stealing it was NO small task, believe you me!  We had to file permits, get easements, open Swiss bank accounts, stock up on hand lotion, get bear pepper spray, just to name a few things.

We made a deal with Amway to get some of it done, and wouldn't you know to this DAY they still have outstanding invoices with us?

Now don't tell anyone, but Phase 2 involves sneaking into every church in the USA and painting over any rainbows that are on walls, burning Sunday School drawings that contain rainbows, and going through every Bible and ripping out the pages containing the Noah's Ark story.

EDIT: typos"
23,We stole the rainbow from god and he’s not getting it back.
24,"My wife and I were hot last week, and then it rained a few days later. 

Praise the Quob!"
25,"“Proclaimed.”

Fuck off."
26,"They should fear the LGBT people, not hate us. We stole from God and he can't do shit to us"
27,OMG “a few days later”! What a fucking coincidence! Wow!
28,"They think they have the power to do so.

I want to say “how cute” but this is Absolutely pathetic"
29,"My sister wife and I decided to take the Sun back for Gawd, and less than 7 hours later the Sun rose! It's a meracal!"
30,😂😂😂
31,"Mama died, and I can see her in my head-movies. Praise Jeebus."
