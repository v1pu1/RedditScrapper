1,Some far-right Christians think yoga is doing the devil’s work and have lobbied schools to remove it from the curriculum. Surprising to see such a book.
2,"Christianity now steals from Hinduism and Buddhism, because they are more appealing to people, including Christians and ex-Christians as well. They want to look progressive and more spiritual to appeal to people, who aren't into religious stuff, but will fall for stories about soul and spiritual journeys."
3,Christianity has a proud tradition of condemning a thing as evil and then coming out with their own version of the thing.
4,"This is pretty harmless as far as fruitcakery goes. There's a long and complex history of crosspollination occurring between Hinduism and Christianity, including stories of Jesus physically surviving his crucifixion and travelling to India to become a guru. 

If you're at all interested in comparative religion, I recommend looking into the topic, it's a really fascinating rabbit hole to go down, even if you're a secular-minded person."
5,"""Put jesus into everything.....Literally"""
6,Christians hate yoga for the same reason they hated rock and roll: it's a popular thing invented by a non-white culture.
7,"Reminds me of the You Testament, where you get yoga powers from Jesus while everyone in Jerusalem is busying piledriving each other into the dirt"
8,"Again Iskcon, fuck it !!"
9,exercising for your own health is bad? lmao
10,"I remember how i had to justify doing martial arts because kung fu was inviting demons in your body so they give you power to fight

..

man if it was that easy"
11,Yoga'sis the new holiday where we worship the day Jesus gave us divine yoga
12,"Lol how is this Iskcon, this is Christian."
13,"Yeah, critical thinking isn’t their strong point. They see it as an Eastern religion that threatens to lead good Christians astray."
14,"This book wasn’t written by Christians. It’s written by a Isckon guru, basically a Hindu cult which worships Krishna as the only true god."
