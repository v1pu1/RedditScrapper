How do I enable god mode? This admin sucks and I feel like I could do better, and still be as lazy as them."
2,"Yep, any day now!"
3,"They use Calvin and Hobbes too. Seriously, WTF?"
4,"Maybe they use Snoopy because Charles M. Schulz, the creator of Peanuts, was a Methodist Sunday School teacher."
5,Spoilers: He won't.
6,"Recently watched *The Sandman* and in one episode there’s a flashback to 1389 and a woman in a tavern says, “it’s the end of times, I tell ya” because of a feud between popes at the time (or something).

Point is, they’ve been saying “he’s about to come down and smite the non believers” for about 2000 years."
7,Forgotten? Are Christians really this oblivious?
8,Because he is white?

11,"something really bugs me bout the lady tho. head is massive, legs just dont look right, her arms seem way too thin, she's shaped like an upside down triangle, not sure what 80s hairstyle that is, and what in the world is that pose? not only is it kinda weird imo, it just . . . doesn't fit?

12,Are they threatening more terrorism?
13,why god has masculine pronoun? isnt he gender free?
14,God is Snoopy?
15,"Ah yes, the well known second coming of Christ.

Snoopy."
16,"Wonder who's fault it is that the world has 'forgotten about god'

That guy's got a lot of explainin' to do."
17,It's the fact that they seem to be looking forward to the indiscriminate smiting that is so unsettling.
18,God sounds like me when I'm bored at playing city sklylines
19,😏 any day...😂😂🤣
20,"Garfield is too edgy, plus a cat which witches always seem to have, so must be satanic."
21,"Schulz did a series of comics for a religious publication; it had adult characters and was compiled in a book called ""What Was Buggin' Ol' Pharaoh?"""
22,Don't forget the creator's Christian.
23,"God's preferred pronouns are he/him.

Wait a minute..."
24,Would that make Garfield the antichrist? That would actually kinda make sense.
25,"They'll go to heaven anyway; that's the rapture they crave.

Kid me went to church twice a week, I was taught that Heaven is the the ultimate day off school. I could play with family, friends, and even play video games 24 hours a day.

Dying sounds genuinely awesome."
