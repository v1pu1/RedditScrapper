1,"I always respond with, ‚Äúwow, your god sounds like an asshole‚Äù when I see stuff like this."
2,[deleted]
3,"Well if He'll isn't those things, then why do people who play/listen to rock music, people who party, people who play video games, masturbate, watch movies, have premarital relationships, eat candy, drink soda, dress less modestly than the Amish, have dark skin, have albinism, don't practice the right version of Christianity, doesn't practice religion at all, listen to the science, have a college education, who repent too hard, don't repent hard enough, get the wrong haircut, don't speak the right language, speaks too much, speaks too little, eats fish, eats pork, is vegan/vegetarian, watches anime, listens to the radio, watches television, don't read the bible, reads the Bible, and just plain exists all go to hell?

I mean, it sounds way more interesting than the 30 or so people who got into heaven."
4,"It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes!"
5,There's no hate like god's love.
6,Ugh I don‚Äôt even believe in Hell anymore and that shit still gives me nightmares and panic attacks. Can‚Äôt completely unlearn Catholic school trauma I guess.
7,"What always interested me is how people always preach of this torment you‚Äôll endure in hell, how you‚Äôll always be burning and in pain, and I‚Äôm like: isn‚Äôt that a bodily function? How on earth are you supposed to feel pain without a body. The only reason you fear pain is because your brain doesn‚Äôt want you to die. That shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if youre already dead. Aren‚Äôt you projecting your earthly and mortal fears onto something that‚Äôs supposed to be everything but earthly and mortal? How does that even make sense"
8,"Ok let me get this straight. 

Satan fell from graces - didn't want to be buddies with god anymore. 
god sends him to hell 
Satan is based af because god is obviously an abusive thug and tries to pull others away from god 
god sends disbelievers to hell with Satan forever. 

Explain to me again why hell wouldn't be a party? Why would Satan torture folks for not following god, who he also didn't follow? 

But, alas, it's all made up garbage anyway so the plot holes don't really matter too much."
9,"""...but he loves you!"""
10,Better than spending all of eternity with last minute converts and singing praises of an asshole.
11,And how do they know this exactly?
12,So mindless pain or mindless worship forever?
13,"Hell isn't even biblical. 

[Heaven and Hell: A History of the Afterlife](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/heaven-and-hell-bart-d-ehrman/1132188925)  


Book by Bart D. Ehrman

>Where did the ideas of heaven and hell come from?

>As strange as it may seem to us now, there was a time when no one thought they would go to heaven or hell after they died. In fact, there is no mention of them in the Old Testament, and Jesus did not believe the souls of the departed were bound for either realm.

>In this gripping history of the afterlife, Bart Ehrman reveals how the concepts of heaven and hell developed and took hold, and why they endure to this day. He examines the social, cultural and historical roots of competing views held by Greeks, Jews and Christians, and traces how beliefs changed over time. Ultimately, he shows that many of our ideas about heaven and hell emerged long after Jesus‚Äôs time, through the struggle to explain the injustices of the world."
14,"Replace ""it is"" with ""I am"".

That's more like it."
15,"Funny how they can think ""gee i can't wait until they're burning in flames for the rest of existence"" and not think they're insane"
16,"I mean... if we're in hell for *eternity*, and we presume we have the same body we have now (because we'd be able to feel pain), eventually the hedonic treadmill will kick in and our hapiness level would return to our baseline. So it might not actually be eternal suffering even if hell was real."
17,"""It is so hot. It is so hot."" Made me laugh"
18,That's kinda hot.
19,Imagine hell is just climate change? Praise oil tycoon Jesus!
20,This is blasphemous. Everyone knows that Hell is similar to heaven except that the beer is stale and the strippers have sexually transmitted diseases.
21,"Most of my friends will be there, so it should be fine...


We have a joke in Canada, because we sometimes get sick of the cold:


A Canadian goes to heaven, but he complains about the weather being on the slightly nippy side. Jesus thinks he is being picky, and decides to send him temporarily to hell to teach him a lesson.

After a while, Jesus goes down to check on him:

> are you tired of it yet?

The Canadian answers angrily:


> CLOSE THE DOOR, there's a draft!"
22,Clearly never played minecraft
23,If heaven is where all the people who claim ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll burn in Hell if you do ___‚Äù I‚Äôd rather go to Hell frankly
24,Which is why when Christians first told of hell to the Vikings they didn't understand why you wouldn't want that.
25,"Alone? Great! You probably don‚Äôt know this, but I don‚Äôt like being near other people."
26,I don‚Äôt believe anymore but the fear reaction to this image is still there. Fucking sucks
27,At least I would be away from sanctimonious religious people.  Can't imagine spending eternal life with some of you toxic idiots who are so self important along with a deity who needs constant ego massaging.
28,Unless you're an introvert with social anxiety. In that case hell is nothing but rock concerts and parties.
29,It's not a threat though people! You CHOOSE to go to hell! God loves you so much he lets you choose your own fate! /s
30,"Idk how these people will talk about how horrible hell is...then worship the one who orchestrates people going there.  
It'd be like if worshipping a certain German man of the past...but somehow way worse."
31,It says a lot that this still sounds better than spending an eternity with a bunch of sycophantic dullards in ‚Äúheaven‚Äù for all eternity.
32,That sounds like summer in Italy
33,"As stupid as it sounds, when I started my deconversion process maybe 12-13 years ago, one of the things that got the ball rolling was seeing that second picture, with the text ""jesus loves you"" overlaid on it. 

It was just a dumb little meme, but it was the first time it hit me that it didn't make any sense that someone could love me more than anything and still send me there."
34,"ah yes, hell.

The imaginary punishment these people need to come up with to scare themselves out of being bad"
35,Isn't that bottom image Anakin Skywalker burning on Mustafar?
36,"Jokes on you, I'm into that"
37,How the hell do you threaten people with shit like this and somehow think you're even remotely one of the good guys? If assholes like that are the ones getting into Heaven then I wouldn't want to be around them anyway
38,"A bit dose of mdma, while overheating at a party with friends around would be hell like torture that‚Äôs what I want hell to be like so I‚Äôll stick to my belief of hell!

Now I‚Äôm gonna take a bong rip"
39,You‚Äôd get used to it after the first few centuries
40,What if you really like rock concerts and parties. Is it really heaven if you can't do anything fun?
41,Sounds terrible! Glad I don‚Äôt believe in it!
42,Why they know so much about hell and so little about heaven?
43,i thought hell was other people
44,TIL: Hell is my new apartment in Florida.
45,"If I don't have a mortal body, then why should heat concern me? No nerve endings ... no pain. I could comfortably reside in the center of a star.

All this hellfire and damnation isn't scary in the least. Christians with their impotent threats smh."
46,I wonder do hell temperatures changes because if they were burn for eternity at some point they must have succumbed into it and feel nothing right?
47,so wait‚Ä¶ what?
48,Prove it üôÑ
49,"Hell isn't even real, so there's that."
50,Hell is so basic. One guy (presumably Abraham or something) invented it as a scare tactic and the other religions after it just copied him without changing it up in the slightest. Why fire only? Medieval torture methods sound way more brutal than boring ass fire bruh
51,Egotistical fuck for making his ‚Äúcreations‚Äù in pain literally nonstop forever if they don‚Äôt praise him/it/whatever
52,"How could anyone find truth in a religion that teaches something so inhumanly foul?

Even pure, hollow nihilism is more moral than this."
53,"So god apparently made the rules of physics that we've come to understand. One of those rules is that nothing can burn forever without constant fuel replenishment, so once your body is gone, which is weird in itself because your body is still left on earth when you die, but brushing that aside and the fact your nervous system and brain are also left behind, how can anyone or anything burn and feel subsequent pain for eternity? Even stars don't burn that long.  


What an absolutely spectacular load of bollocks."
54,"They seem almost happy to point this out. Like, other people are out there living their best lives without their religion and it bothers them that they can find happiness without their emotional crutch. Maybe it makes them feel insecure."
55,"If God is omnipotent and omniscient, shouldn't he know exactly what his creations are going to do?  And if his creations do any of those things, is not he as their creator at fault?  


Then, to punish those creations for **doing what you knew they would do when they were made**, is not that pointless cruelty?  Why create something if you know you are just going to condemn it to eternal torment for an infinitely longer time period than the time it was alive?  By all proportions, if it's only alive for 60-90 years but you torture it for literally infinite amounts of time, then effectively 100% of its purpose was to suffer and nothing else.  


If you create things just so that they can suffer, are you still a **loving** and **merciful** God?"
56,"""Gee, I wonder why people don't like my religion? Well must be because they're deplorable scum that deserve to be tortured forever by my sky daddy I call benevolent! Lemme threaten them with one of the most painful experiences possible some more."""
57,Damn dude that's metal as fuck
58,Do these people even pay attention about their own religion? There are literal parts of hell which are frozen(if Dante‚Äôs inferno is to be considered canon)
59,i thought the top image was jerma lmao
60,WE HAWT
61,I'd rather burn than spend my life sucking up to an insecure narcissist of a sky-daddy who would happily send every person I love to a pit of fire.
62,Yes. But... But! God is love. And we will be in Heaven pointing fingers and laughing. Because we did the things we said he wanted. And you didn't. So there!
63,Still sounds more fun than heaven with those loosers
64,Introverts with burning kink
65,"I needed to doublechek the subreddit, I thought I was on r/distressingmemes"
66,"They have Succubi there, so I see no problem there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
67,"That's no where in the Bible, but k."
68,It's so funny that they forget that without a nervous system you won't feel anything. If your dead you can't think or feel because the mind is the OS of the brain.
69,"That's why I just go all-in.

I praise Satan, so once I go to hell I get to be a cool demon or something. Idk, I never went to hell."
70,"But if you don‚Äôt have a body, who cares what the atmospheric conditions are?"
71,Okay but how do you know that ? Have you been there ?
72,Yeah. But all the cool people are there so no matter what it‚Äôs gonna be kind of a party
73,"People love to say being sent to hell is one's fault when they could believe in someone who doesn't exist, but if God did exist, it means he created or allowed hell to exist. He's in full responsibility, meaning he does condemn and sends people to hell, a place where ""sinners get tortured for eternity"" in the catholic's little propaganda to scare kids. You have to wonder if he's really a good guy, but the cultist don't give it much thought"
74,I‚Äôm already alone and burning
75,"Actually the only description the bible really has of hell is that it's ""to be apart from god""

Don't threaten me with a good time."
76,"Alone? Burning? For all eternity? Damn, that beats being forced to stare at a being human minds cannot comprehend for all eternity. In Hell I'd at least have the nice ASMR sounds of my flesh being turned to bacon instead of the deafening internal screams of my mind being melted as I am forced to witness what human eyes were never meant to see."
77,I‚Äòm telling y‚Äôall I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm burning if Metallica is being played
78,"And what about heaven? 

Cold so cold. Right? All that solar radiation and lack of air. Unable to breathe. Unless of course you dont need to breathe, And you dont feel the cold and hot and radiation. In which case why would anyone feel any heat in hell? When have you ever heard of spiritual fire? And if it existed, wouldn't there also be spiritual coldness. 

Religion is so full of shit. Join my religion or burn. I already am not burning. Oh you'll burn when you die, Yeah but if i get cremated then i wont feel it so what does it matter i'll be dead. Nononono when you die then you will wake up and go to hell. Have you ever seen someone wake up after they die and walk to a place called hell? No You wake up but you are not in your body....... Oooooh ok, but my body has a nervous system attached to my brain that tells me when something is painful, is that gonna come too? No you wont have a nervous system.

So i am just gonna be a skeleton? Skeletons cant wake up. No your soul is gonna wake up. How? It will float away. Oh i see and whats the soul made out of? Nothing. Its a spirit, and what can a spirit do? A spirit is something you can see. But can you touch it? No. Ok can you taste it? No you cant touch it , taste it, see it or hear it or smell it. SO what youre saying is When you die, Something that you cannot see, feel, hear, smell or taste floats off to go burn itself.

Yes but you can be saved if you believe in Jesus.   


Hold up for a second, I have a million dollars just over there, that god gave me this morning when i asked him for it in prayer. I dont believe you. Why not?"
79,"Ah yes ""perfect mercy and unconditional love""."
80,"Remembers kids, Jesus loves you, but if you eat a shrimp he will send you to a lake of fire for all eternity! 

Now THAT is love! /s"
81,"I'm so tired of this shit. I don't want to hear your ever-worsening descriptions of what Hell is like. They're irrelevant until you prove that *it actually exists.*

You could come up with the most horrific, most painful, most terrifying definition you want of what goes on in Hell, but none of if it will matter one bit until *prove Hell is real.* I don't CARE how scary Hell is, if it's *not actually a thing.* There is no reason to keep inventing ever-more heinous things that supposedly go on in a Hell that you haven't proven anyone has ever gone to."
82,I would have preferred if god did t create me so I wouldn‚Äôt have these immoral problems
83,"If god knows everything about a person and everything they will do when He makes them, doesn't it mean he makes a lot of people with the express purpose of burning them?"
84,So Arizona?
85,Hot means more energy means easy energy sources means we build a big machine to go and fuck those on the other side
86,Oh boy is it hot in here or is it just you??
87,Unless... Unless all my friends are there!!
88,"Alone? That's great! I'm an introvert.

If you wanted to make a hell for me, it'd be 24/7 church."
89,It is so hot
90,How big is hell that everyone gets their own eternal torture room? You'd think with overcrowding you'd at least have a eternal damnation bunk mate
91,Sounds like a summer in Texas.
92,"Is this the best desert people came up with, seriously lack imagination"
93,It is so hot
94,So what exactly do people do in 'Heaven' for the rest of eternity? Go to rock concerts?
95,Is it hot though?
96,Hell looks awesome and that lava bath looks soothing
97,"Me, who saw Varto in the 90s:

Pathetic"
98,All of a sudden hell sounds a lot more tempting
99,"I'd rather spend eternity alone in hell than with these ""Christians"""
100,But is it a dry heat?
