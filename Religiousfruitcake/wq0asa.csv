1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Imagine this christian's reaction when they found out that science, basically, is almost counterfactual.

To brush off ""atheism"" because it doesn't sound like you think it's supossed to be, it's a path that lead to decadence of the knowledge: we wouldn't have all these stuff if we stayed like this person argued ""it takes more faith to been an atheist""."
2,I don't understand how shit works so I'll make it up
3,"Life only looks designed if you see it superficially. Have you ever looked at it in depth? It's stupid, inefficient and overly complicated."
4,">	DNA looks like it contains information, but it’s not information.

????? then what is it???"
5,"1) Life doesn’t look designed. 

2) DNA *is* information, of the genetic variety

3) Objective Morality does not exist and it doesn’t look like it does either

4) This one is correct. See Puddle analogy

5) Everything that we know has a cause of some sort but there could exist things that have no cause. The universe might have a cause but we don’t know it, and the universe might not have a cause because time and physics didn’t exist before the universe so who knows what the fuck was going on

6) It actually looks like an ultimate purpose doesn’t exist, or if it does that nobody knows it

7) Very few scientists and atheists say that there is no free will, so most will say free will exists

8) Grug from 2million BC invented addition, it doesn’t mean he can do calculus"
6,"""We're all idiots but we don't wanna seem stupid"""
7,Tell that to Hypatia.
8,"The traditions of science have multiple origins. The ancient Ionian Greeks got things started, there were also developments in the Islamic Golden age to consider but the ball really got rolling in the renaissance and the age of enlightenment in which there was an increasing tendency to question and challenge long held dogmas and higher learning became less and less the exclusive domain of religious figures."
9,"Christianity DID NOT start the science, it slaughtered it."
10,"""Everything that begins to exist has a cause but god doesn't"" is a statement that christians surprisingly often put forward.

Also, who the hell said that DNA doesn't contain information? That's the worst strawman I saw today."
11,"Is this person claiming that free will doesn't exist without a god, but with a god that's in charge of everything and supposedly always gets his way, free will exists?"
12,"Well, flat earthers exist so clearly something either went wrong or was created badly."
13,Magics.  Put there by the sky magician.
14,"My guess is they are referring to the fact that DNA isn't actually code. That's just an analogy we use to explain how DNA makes RNA. There is no conscious observer interpreting DNA, and no conscious messenger setting a pattern to be interpreted. DNA is a string of molecules that react in specific ways to other arrangements of molecules, not code, if we are strictly speaking. 

Generously interpreted, they may have been referring to b some idea like this. DNA seems to contain information (like a code) but it doesn't (like a code). We can still get information out of it, but DNA itself doesn't have ""information"" it has a string of molecules."
15,Grug MVP!
16,"I would argue that the first caveman who noticed two rocks smacking together could make fire STARTED it.  But your point is valid, people trying to DISPROVE religion have done the most to advance science, for pretty much the entirety of human existence."
17,"Fair enough. I don’t really understand that viewpoint, though. Couldn’t you say that writing on paper doesn’t carry any meaning, because it’s simply ink arranged in formations? Some people don’t really make sense lol"
18,"Well no, because in that situation, like I was saying, would be a conscious communicator passing information to a conscious recipient. Information is what's inside our heads, not out in the world, at least by the interpretation we are going with. Not saying it's wrong to have a different understanding of the word, just explaining the most generous possible explanation of OP."
19,Totally. It’s just hard to wrap my head around because “dna is data” is literally like the first thing you hear in biology.
