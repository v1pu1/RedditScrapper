1,"So, they have two Covid variants now?"
2,My mom has COVID so now I’m just double pissed off.
3,"It’s so telling that they think dumb catchphrases like this are some kind of epic takedown. Like…what is this even supposed to mean, because you trust God, covid doesn’t matter? How is there even any connection between the two ideas? You can be religious and still wear a seatbelt, cook your food thoroughly, wash your hands, get regular checkups, etc. You don’t have less faith by taking basic sanitary precautions.

But people who pass along idiotic memes/tweets like this don’t stop to deconstruct what kind of idea they’re parroting. They just see a jumble of words that sound sassy and snarky and stick-it-to-the-libs-y, and suddenly it’s their entire identity."
