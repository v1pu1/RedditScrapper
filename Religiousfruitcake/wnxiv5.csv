1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Whatever solution Islam brings for anything is completely impractical in modern society, unless of course, the society isn't that modern at all."
2,"Is ""head"" the collective noun for a group of prostitutes?  A head of prostitutes?"
3,"Yes, police officer, that's Islamic driven misogyny right there."
4,"Not so fun fact, this 80 lashes ruling and requiring 4 male witnesses is also one of the reasons Muslim women are afraid of reporting rape. 

If a woman who isn't married gets raped and gets pregnant, they're usually punished for fornication because they don't need to prove fornication with 4 male witnesses since she's pregnant, on the other hand, she has no 4 male witnesses to prove rape.

They often just kill themselves."
5,I think a 5 yo can give a better response to that.
6,Many religions are merely idiotic. Others are also cruel. So this one seems both cruel and idiotic.
7,Tell me you detest women without telling me you detest women!
8,"When cheating on your wife, always bring 4 guys to watch, but not your friends if they won't turn you in."
9,I assumed it meant the manager of the brothel.
10,"*Tell me you detest*

*Women without telling me*

*You detest women!*
