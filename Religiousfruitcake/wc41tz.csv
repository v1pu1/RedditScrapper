Since when is less than 10 percent the most? Im atheist and work a regular front end dev job 7 hours a day and dont work a minute more than that. I could potentially get rich if I put all my time into learning and developing further, opening my own business and stuff, but I aint got no motivation for that. I prefer to go play videogames, read books, have a few drinks, spend a lot of time on preparing meals, travel somewhere etc."
