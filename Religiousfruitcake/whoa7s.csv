1,Strawman
2,Did a five year old make this??
3,"I’ve seen people make this argument with photons several times

Our species is doomed isn’t it?"
4,Misrepresenting an atheist’s claim to their beliefs. But alright.
5,"We can't see God, we can't feel God, we can't hear God, we can't observe God's effect on the world, we can't even come up with a mathematical formula that might make the existence of God possible (let alone plausible), no precedent, and absolutely NOTHING that even remotely suggests that ""a wizard did"" is the most likely explanation for anything at all. 

It's been thousands of years, and the best religious apologists have been able to come up with is

1. Thomas Aquinas' ""first mover"" spiel - the closest thing to an actual argument anyone has ever managed, but it makes way too many unfounded assumptions and was eventually rendered completely outdated thanks to quantum physics
2. the argument from improbability - smoke and mirrors; everything is improbable to the point of impossibility if you add enough variables
3. the argument from fine-tuning - do I even have to explain why the endlessly vast, boiling-freezing-irradiated hell that is the universe is NOT fine-tuned for human life? 
4. pareidolia ... so much pareidolia ...
5. the least reliable eye witness accounts imaginable
6. some anthropocentric bullshit about morality or the human mind or something 
7. ""fulfilled"" prophecies that haven't been fulfilled by any stretch of the imagination and ""scientific miracles"" that are neither scientific nor miraculous
8. ""But my holy book says so!""
9. ""But I say so!"""
6,So your god is just a theory?
7,"I facepalmed so hard I fell over and hit the floor. No god saved me.  Just like that, god zero, gravity ‘won’."
8,"I've found that sometimes, people say things so dumb, arguing with them would just hurt you. So I just laugh.

Started laughing when my mother claimed we can't see wind, how do we know it's real."
9,"I also can't see air, don't understand any fancy shmancy formulas, but that doesn't stop me from understanding that air exists. The effect of gravity can be observed, by the fact that you are not flying away. God, or it's effect has never been observed."
10,Isnt pelosi catholic? I love how they create the narrative that its them vs. the atheists. Trump is their American Jesus...thats the hilarious part.
11,"This _would_ be kind of a flimsy argument - if it were all I had.  It isn't:

- [Thanks to a glaring contradiction in Christianity's core tenets, God cannot exist as the faith describes him.](https://old.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/wehacf/it_hurt_itself_in_its_confusion/iisoqf2/)
- [Even apologetics with 'skin in the game', as it were, admit there's no physical evidence fro the events outlined in Exodus](http://www.askwhy.co.uk/truth/350Exodus.php); that, plus the easily disproven accounts of creation and the formation of human languages suggest that Judaism isn't to be believed, either.
- Ayesha was nine years old.  I don't feel like I need to look further to know Islam isn't for me.
- Regrettably, I don't know much about religions outside the Abrahamic ones, but I do find it a bit odd that, across billions of followers across thousands of faiths, not once in history has one of the worshipped come to talk to struggling mortals who really do care about doing right by them and left credible evidence behind to reinforce their faith...^*
- ...and yes, we cannot see gravity, but we can both directly observe and mathematically predict its effects, as well as repeat experiments with it.  If someone were able to find similarly _rigourous_ proof for the existence of a deity, I would **absolutely** believe - how could one not?

^(* Maybe they're too busy whispering in prophets' ears about >!why misogyny is okay and they totally deserve a $60M private jet.!<)"
12,"So my blindness is why I am an atheist and not the whole convoluted mess that makes no sense and not caring about some diety's feelings, who knew!"
13,Mental shortcuts typical of Christians.
14,You can see gravity though.
15,"Hah this reminds me of this""

"" in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea... And
  when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
  saying, Lord, save me.""

Matthew 14:24-33

The proponent can illustrate and make a movie of Jesus taking steps over the waters of Galilee. The viewers can see Jesus,
the ripples in the water, the trees and brushes in the background. However, the assumptions include gravity. In fact,
the selective action of gravity is the sole purpose for the passage. The author is attempting to impress upon his readers that
Jesus was 'above the natural law' (i.e., supernatural).

The trouble is that the proponent cannot explain logically how it is that gravity pulls selectively on every object in the vicinity
yet not on Jesus. Certainly, unless the magician is fooling us with another sleight of hand, we cannot reproduce this feat in a
controlled lab experiment.

But if Jesus walking on water is supernatural, Peter's bizarre experience is absolutely surrealistic. According to this passage,
Peter sinks gradually in inverse proportion to his faith. Our experience with these matters is that a subject would sink in a
picosecond, certainly before he can finish saying 'Lord, save me.' You don't have to take my argument at face value. You can
test my assertions independently.  Just fill your bathtub with water and touch its still surface lightly with the sole of your right
foot. As soon as you are ready to go, quickly repeat the magic words 'Lord, save me.' Thus, you can objectively test the
strength of your faith and whether it was possible for Peter to sink gradually."
16,"Well surely we can't see gravity but we do have an equation for it. Whats god's equation, Units, dimensional unit, constants, practical experimentation evidences?"
17,"Tf you mean we can’t see gravity? Yes we can. Yes we fucking can. We’ve got images of black holes. Look at the event horizon. Boom, gravity-based distortion of space time."
18,"We can measure the effect of gravity, essentially seeing it with our measurement tools.

Every experiment ever conducted had the opportunity to measure the effects of your God and has come up with nothing."
19,At least gravity has a real tangible effect on your life
20,"The difference is, we have seen things fall down. We will continue to see things fall down. But we have prayed for the sick, and lots of the sick don’t recover. The power of go’s doesn’t seem to be as powerful as a degree in medicine"
21,"Dropping an apple and it hitting the floor isn’t gravity it’s density. The Apple is denser then the air. Ducks float in water because of boyancy, they are more bouyant than the water. Can someone explain a simple science experiment one can do with items in there home proving gravity?"
22,How intellectually blessed someone has to be to think it worth saying out loud
23,"we kind of can see gravity given that we aren’t like floating around, but then insert christian’s saying we can “see” god cuz of the pretty plants and water and whatever else."
24,stupid logic. and no one knows who im talking about
25,"""tell you what. See this giant block of concrete? You stand under it and I'll cut the cable.""

...

""No? Why not? What could possibly happen?"""
26,"You can feel gravity, but you can't anything god. What is the difference between a plate of food that someone prayed over"
27,You can see the gravity if you jump out of Empire States building or any other building that is tall enough.
28,"Just, don't drop your phone"
29,"I have been able to demonstrate that god is not real. A few nights ago, I opened Notepad and typed down a message that said ""God, if you exist, then make me wake up on the floor"". I was disappointed to find that I woke up on my bed the next morning."
30,it’s obviously a jab at the argument itself (of god not being real because we can’t see him) not atheism as a hole
31,I love Ricky Gervais’s statement to Stephen Colbert. Comparing the bible and scientific texts….. I’ll find the link…
32,Holy shit is gravity really real? As an atheist i did not know that. I am converting to christianity now.
33,Soooo do i need to understand they dont believe that gravity exist ? Just to know if i should leave this planet again
34,If they want to test if gravity is real they can go jump off a bridge.
35,"Indeed.  Also, [we can see gravity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens)"
36,"Also, more importantly, gravity can quite literally be seen when it bends light."
37,"If you mean an adult with a 5 year olds understanding of everything, then yes."
38,In all likelihood
39,Seriously? That's the only thing we see
40,Oh good someone saved me a rant! - have a reward
41,"Christians: Listen here, you little shit…"
42,"This is giving god way too much credit. While scientific theories by definition can only be disproved, never proven, they have all been proven in the colloquial sense of the word. 

Meanwhile, god doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis."
43,Your*. You're = you are
44,"Yep. If God exists and is omnipresent (or at least has presence on Earth), then we have no frame of reference for what a world without God would be like. If God doesn't exist (or does exist, but isn't omnipresent (and thus not present on Earth), doesn't interact with the universe, or interacts so subtly that there is no meaningful way to tell whether or not He's involved with something), then we have no frame of reference for what a world *with* God would be like. Either way, we have no way of measuring something whose presence or absence has absolutely no degree of variation within the framework of what is humanly observable. We *do* have frames of reference for the presence or absence of things like wind and gravity, and while we can't (usually) see them, we *can* **feel** them."
45,"
>a subject would sink in a
picosecond

I know this was just hyperbole but I wanted to do the math and in one picosecond under freefall in Earth gravity you would fall less than 5•10^-24 m, or about three millionths of the width of a proton."
46,Also you can throw a ball and you will see gravity.
47,also also  quite a lot of christians DO deny gravity
48,"What we see is an interpretation made by our mind of photons who touch our eyes, we see nothing directly."
49,He’s not even science. There's a *reason* why the concept of [NOMA](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Non-Overlapping_Magisteria) exists.
50,"Yeah, thanks but don't do that."
51,"That’s technically seeing the effects of gravity, but I’d argue gravitational lensing is literally seeing space-time bend, which is seeing gravity."
52,"wait, do they?"
53,Space-time bend is the effect of gravity to me there is no difference.
54,"yea flat earthers are all christians and they deny gravity, and there is a lor more of these weirdos then you tink"
55,"Space-time bend *is* gravity, it’s not exactly that we’re seeing gravity bend light, but that we’re able to observe the actual curvature of space-time because of the light."
56,the same can be said for the ball.
