1,"I've come here to clear some things up.

Specifically, we didn't know shit from fuck back then.

The world is round."
2,Enoch is not in the Bible.
3,I wish I knew these types of people irl. It would be endless entertainment listening to their unhinged rants.
4,"Did they just pulled a self-burn?

>The pedos that are puppets that rule this world know."
5,Byrds aren't real.
6,"Puppets rule the world?

If you rule...like you're the actual ruler with no one above you...who could pull your strings?"
7,"Well, that's Enoch of that nonsense."
8,"The book of Enoch is not in the bible. Enoch is. Multiple Enoch's, in fact, which may help to explain why I included my geographic orientation in my name."
9,It is the books known as the Apocrypha which are included in the Roman Catholic Bible but not the Protestant version.
10,The only times I met people like that was when I went to see 2 of my friends in a psychiatric hospital (one had attempted suicide and the other had had a bad trip on datura). The conversations were quite surprising and confusing.
11,Since when there has been a connection between flat earth and the secret pedophile elite? Not that one couldn’t buy more than one conspiracy theory simultaneously.
12,"Satan practicing stop motion, obvi. Or reptilians in their equivalent of Skeksis suits."
13,"The book of Enoch is apocryphal for Roman Catholics. The Christians of Ethiopia are, to my knowledge, the only Christians who have kept it."
14,I think they're referring to the Catholic priests. They might be owning up to themselves.
15,The Vatican wasn’t too happy about some stuff in the Apocrypha
16,I think it’s that conspiracy theory that says the ultra rich of Hollywood traffic kids for pedos like Epstein etc
17,Maria-Magdalena was one of the problems in Apocrypha.
18,"I found some cool stuff in Apocrypha, not so chill with most Daedra though"
19,"Damn wahmin, trying to ruin things since II AC"
