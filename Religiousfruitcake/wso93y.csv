1,"Chariot Wheels - oh yeah, surely nobody dumped garbage into the massive body of water that nobody could drink from /s

Noah's Ark - literally just a limestone formation.

Dead Sea Scrolls - Old testament only. Sorry, but christianity doesn't mean shit if jesus didn't rise from the dead.

Jesus' Tomb - really? we know, beyond a doubt, that a specific person was put in a 2000 year old tomb? no genetic evidence? perhaps it's just *a regular tomb like literally everyone else was put in*

Holy Bible - who says nobody just fulfilled the prophesies on paper to make a cult that would later become the dominant force in europe? also, you can't say something is true because that something says so

Earth - classic."
2,"How would you know that is Noah's Ark.

 And not the ship Ut-napishtim was tasked to construct by the God of Water Enkin, to save his relatives and animals from a flood that would wipe all life out.

Like the Ark of Noah is heavily inspired by the flood myth from the Epic of Gilgamesh."
3,"Chariot wheels at the bottom of the Red Sea proves the Exodus?

So an old tire at the bottom of the Lincoln Park Lagoon proves proves the Ojibwe Indians had Chryslers?"
4,"In fact, Muslims say this too.  It's not exclusive to Christians."
5,This meme was absolutely made by a 14 year old “meme lord” after some youth group
6,"""Evidence"""
7,"If I bring a cake to the bake sale, the existence of that cake is not proof that I made it, or can even bake. I could have bought it from a store, or had a friend make it.

The existence of Earth is not proof that God made it."
8,"Guys I actually have proof that there is a secret society that hides from out world populated by powerful witches with their own schools and politics 

Source: Harry Potter"
9,The Jews didn't even cross the Red sea. It was the Reed Sea. Red Sea is a translation mistake.
10,They shouldn’t be pointing people to the Bible if they want more theists 😂
11,Jesus knocked Paul on his ass and blinded him while introducing himself. Why won't he do the same for me?
12,Those wheels probably fell off s boatz
13,"How do u know your god is real?
.....eorf:)"
14,They've found Noah's Ark like 8 times lol.
15,"The Chariot wheels was a part of fake news:

16,"But you forgot about the 700 year old piece of cloth someone convinced us was put over Jesus! And his foreskin, you can't deny the holy foreskin!

It's always been circular reasoning. They either can't think or specifically exclude Christianity from their critical thinking."
17,"Most Christian (and really religious) arguments start with the Bible is 100% true. No mistranslations or symbolism, everything is the truth. Then they work backwards to find evidence to support it."
18,">Jesus' Tomb - really? we know, beyond a doubt, that a specific person was put in a 2000 year old tomb? no genetic evidence? perhaps it's just

>a regular tomb like literally everyone else was put in

It's even wilder. The proof is that he IS NOT in that tomb. That proves he resurrected apparently."
19,"What do you mean, the spiderman comics say that Spider-Man is real so Spider-Man has to be real"
20,The dead sea scrolls only show Judaism was around at the time.
21,Religions trying not to copy each other's myths (impossible)
22,"If i remember correctly, but i'm not sure, someone tried to reproduce both the ark. While the Gilgamesh one was able to dtay afloat the noah ine would have sinked"
23,The what
24,He wrote his name on it in big letters.
25,Wait they didn't????????
26,If you took all the splinters from the holy cross and combined them the resulting cross would probably need to be registered as an aviation hazard
27,"I like how they said 2019 in the Noahs Ark picture. 

Like it took them that long to find it, and they won’t even dig it out? I guess we should just look at that weird shaped mountain and accept it on faith."
28,I remember when tons of pastors fell for this and started preaching about how this proves the bible is real 🙄
29,even better lol
30,so just an unused tomb... haha
31,"Never, the Romans would never copy the Greeks almost exactly, and the Christians would never copy other religions for their own gain, never"
32,I believe the consensus among archaeologists is that the frugal and efficient Ojibwe preferred Toyotas
33,"> and accept it on faith.

Yeah, that's how they do it.  They don't want evidence, because they know it'll never be supporting them."
34,"No no no, such a thing would never happen. Impossible"
35,"Happy Easter and Merry Christmas, everybody!"
36,"No way a religion could be made in order to control a large group of people, that's how cults work, and they're definitely not a cult"
37,"All religions are cults, they just stopped being called one when they become widespread enough"
38,Amen. Wait
39,Amen :)
