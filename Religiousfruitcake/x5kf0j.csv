1,Guess who will be left alone/ghosted as soon as the son turns 18?
2,This just gonna make him hate more just like my parents send me an islamic school and mosque in summer. This just helps me to learn more about how shitty religions are.
3,This is pure child abuse. It's shocking that this bullshit is tolerated. How does it not qualify as mental abuse? For ing your bullshit on helpless child?
4,"This seems sorta like it was written as a rage bait, but I'd believe it lol"
5,"You know I feel bad for the son, but also the poor Bible camp counselors next summer!"
6,10 years from now it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt my teenager tell me anything or open up to me‚Äù then 20 years from now they‚Äôll be making a post on Reddit asking ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt my son contact us and lives 2000miles away from us? Can‚Äôt possibly be my shit parenting and it my son‚Äôs fault.‚Äù
7,"This is a 3 year old repost lmao

8,"I feel so bad for that kid 

Even despite living through indoctrination from birth, he still questions the world around him and wants to become a scientist! 

I hope he makes it when he's finally free from his parents"
9,Congratulations. Your son will hate you and your obsolete Middle Eastern religion.
10,"""Can't have him questioning""

If your religion can't hold up to the scrutiny of a 9 year old, it might be time to get out."
11,‚ÄúHow to make your child even less religious and also how to make sure they go non-contact with you the moment they‚Äôre old enough to do so‚Äù
12,"Wow, america truly has too many maniacs √°n morons it surprises me"
13,My muslim mother broke my musical keyboard with her own hands and made me throw the remains out because music is sinful. These sickos need help
14,Hope when that kid grows up he researched homes that abuse the elderly....and sends his parents there
15,Some people shouldn't be parents
16,Yes I‚Äôm sure alienating him further will really do the trick. In 9 years this kid is going to run as fast and as far as he can away from his parents and his church. At least i hope he does!
17,‚ÄúPlease help us brainwash and abuse our child.‚Äù
18,"Good. Alienate the kid so he resents you for the rest of his life.  I support this because it means he will make it an absolute point to get the fuck away from you and pursue his dream.  

Ok I don't support the method but I support the result."
19,"Oh, the lesson will stink in, I assure you...

Just wait until he's 16-17-18..."
20,"My parents did this to me when I was a kid, now they act shocked when I don‚Äôt talk to them"
21,How to teach your kid to hate both you AND your religion in one easy lesson.
22,"So, in other words, they are raising another atheist."
23,That kid turns 18 and he is never going to speak with his parents again. This shit is fubr
24,This makes me so so sad. That poor child
25,"That is a very bad parent and their son will either grow up to hate them, or shoot up a school."
26,"IF you do this, you are proving you are not mentally fit to take care of a child. Poor red states..."
27,Well that kid is going to hate you for this bullshit. I would know I've been there
28,"CHILD ABUSE
CHILD ABUSE
CHILD ABUSE

You cannot tell me this is anything less."
29,"My aunt and uncle did something similar to my cousins, for Christmas they would buy them a ton of big expensive gifts, then a few days later they would get ""robbed"". The only things that would ever get stolen was their kids presents, everything else was untouched."
30,How to make your child hate religion 101.
31,Just gonna learn how to pander to their beliefs and ghost them ASAP.
32,"I don't know of any religion where it encourages you to sell your children's toys and coerce them to follow only your will, where it doesn't backfire eventually. They're going to get a wake up call very soon, I'm sure."
33,"We need laws for this ASAP, a child is a civilian, a human, not a property, you can't force them into things like this, you can't deny a child vaccination, you can't force a prostitute on a child nor send them to a conversion therapy."
34,"had a coworker prohibit her kid from anything harry potter bc it promoted witch craft and she was religious. u know that poor kid prob had to sneak around to read the books and see the movies at her friends house to enjoy and fit in. i did the same when i was a kid, and took off as soon as i turned 18 and my mom lost her shit bc she couldnt control me anymore. its all narcissism and control."
35,"Wtf? A Christian priest came up with the Big Bang theory, and Mendelian genetics. Why can‚Äôt a Christian be a scientist?"
36,"In 15 years they're gonna ask ""why did my son cut us off ??? We did nothing wrong !!!!!"""
37,"I‚Äôll take ‚Äúchildren who grow up to hate their parents‚Äù for 500, Alex."
38,Do you have a link?  My kids are godless heathens who love Lego.
39,Follow this one easy step to get your child to resent you!
40,Funny that kid at 9 is already smarter than his parents. He‚Äôll go far in life if he sticks to science. I hope he don‚Äôt fall for that religious bullshit
41,"This is abuse, and the child should be protected from these crazies"
42,"Not much to learn about god except to use ""it was god's plan"" to explain everything."
43,Pretty sure you‚Äôll just turn that kid into a psychopath

45,Would be hilarious if people just mailed it back just to spite the parents
46,"If you can‚Äôt handle his questions, does that mean you can‚Äôt answer them? If so, that means that faith doesn‚Äôt have all of the answers, as the name implies"
47,"They said theyll make hin watch it, message saying youre interested, go and act like you want to buy them, then tell the kis he has every right to question anything that doesnt make sense and that being a scientist would be a great use of his abilities, then leave without actually buying thw toys from the parents"
48,"Oh, the therapy bills..."
49,"""Our son insists on using his brain... we cant abide this as religious people therefore we are going to punish him...."""
50,I would buy everything and give it back to the kid. Could it than be considered theft if the parents take the presents again?
51,This is child abuse
52,"I can't wait for her follow up post: ""why won't my son talk to me? I its not like i did anything wrong..."""
53,"""How to get thrown into the worst state run nursing home 101"""

55,Guess who‚Äôs parents are getting cut out of their life when they get older üòÇ
56,"I remember bible camp, the worst, especially as a non-believer. Christian family camp was also bad, the only plus was paint ball..."
57,"Catch me pretending to wanna buy and asking for the address to pick up the toys so I can actually use it report them to CPS. 

(That might not work since it's only toys, but this is manipulative as fuck so I'd do it anyway just to see if they would end up on a watch list or something)"
58,Hes 9.   Got about 8 or 9 years before he never sees you again.   Enjoy the time you have left.
59,"""Can't tolerate him questioning""

If your god can't handle the wavering curious questions of a child then your religion is a sham."
60,"My parents did this. I wasn't allowed toys again either. I was 3 and I had a question about the bible. How come it has so many authors if Jesus lived? Why didn't he write it himself? 

It's funny how they then tried to punish me for learning to imagine alone. Cause I don't need toys I have a brain. I cut them off as an adult for some odd reason (also the horrible violence but this was a factor)"
61,My parents did something similar when I was a kid. It‚Äôs true. The kids never forget that. It‚Äôs just not the lesson they think they‚Äôre teaching.
62,My mom tried to make me watch a video of starving and Malnourished African kids WHILE I WAS EATING just because I'm not eating properly.
63,"So my parents did this exact same shit to me. They churned out an atheist who stopped that bs with my generation. Encourage your kids to question and never crush their curiosity.
Guaranteed this kid will resent his parents for years"
64,"""so the lesson really STINKS in"""

70,"""We can't tolerate him questioning""

This is actually painful to read. How are these people not realising how deluded they are, I legitimately feel bad for them."
71,looks fake
72,Can people not see obvious jokes in posts anymore or is everyone this easily outraged and ready to spill?
73,"So... y'all just gonna take a screenshot with a text that was obviously photoshopped in as proof??


I Wonder why you say religious people can't think for themselves when you get riled up for pictures like that"
74,"This is what religion has done throughout it's history. If you don't do what I tell you I'll force you, or take something away, or condemn you.

Religion really can be worst part of humanity."
75,everyone‚Äôs here like ‚Äúthis is child abuse‚Äù and i‚Äôm just like ‚Äúoooo i had that lego set when it came out in either 2012 or 2013‚Äù
76,Congratulations you two just booked yourselves a fast track trip to being hated by your own kid.

84,"I swear when this religion started all they way back in Roman times it was about love and forgiveness, not only that they didn't force the religion on anyone (until the Romans and English adopted it) so if they really want to do there 'work of god' then maybe they should actually go study the history of there religion not just believe shit they here on Facebook"
85,Are they trying to make their kid an atheist?
86,"‚ÄúWhy has the younger generation lost their faith?‚Äù 

Probably because y‚Äôall regularly pull shit like this lol"
87,Swear to my mothers non-existent titties if anyone buys those for the cause-
88,Lego Minecraft is some real divide by zero shit
89,Did anyone doxx these parents‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ *for science*?
90,Yooo I got that set
91,All that'll do is drive your child to resenting you and resenting religion.
92,Poor kid. His parents ought to be ashamed of themselves.
93,‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tolerate him questioning‚Äù lmaooo
94,I'm pretty sure that'd against the law
95,I swear this has to be a form of child abuse.
96,Disgusting.
97,And the lesson is you have shitty parents.
98,This totally sounds like something Jesus would do. /s
