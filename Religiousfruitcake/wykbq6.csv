1,This is Christian canon and it's why they are all unmitigated assholes who can't be trusted. They can do anything they want as long as they ask their sky fairy for forgiveness. They like their religion without the messiness of actually having to have morals.
2,"Lol, Baptist liquor cabinets are a testament to this mode of hedonistic Christian living.  Just don't die before you can express remorse."
3,"To answer your caption question, yes. Catholic priests and Mormon leaders go to heaven and we all know what they're famous for. They genuinely think they are better than you bc they admit to being terrible. You can't make it make sense"
