1,"Imagine being the winner.   A girl who won first and is on top of th e world.

And then some sore loser Karens question your gender because their precious baby Karens lost.   It blows up in the news and the school digs through your records and confirms it wasnt true.

Does it matter?   Are all the kids congradulating you?   Or making fun of you and calling you a guy.

She should sue."
2,"“Quickly, someone check this child’s genitals!!”
- no sane person, ever. Like what the fuck"
3,When you grow up being so privileged that you can't accept defeat.
4,“investigation”? was she gonna go to jail if they found out she wasn’t afab? not to mention the major breach of privacy that must have entailed
5,Pedophiles advocating for female genital inspections so they can find the “pedophiles”
6,"Ex Mormon here, if you think this is wild, wait until you hear some of the things in their religion or that they have done"
7,Sore loser conservatives
8,God damn what sore losers
9,"If their child was a boy it would at least be logical. Incredibly shitty logic but logic nonetheless. But both parties are women so all they're saying is ""Your child was better at something than my child? How dare you, she must be trans."" Jesus H. Christ people are fucking stupid."
10,Could it be that my daughters are just not the best? No! They’re obviously cheating by a very minuscule amount!
11,they checked the records without knowledge or permission of the child or the parents. just thought it needed to be said.
12,"I'm just sitting here with my finger hovering over the start button on my microwave full of popcorn, waiting on some amazonian F2M to start *bodying* fools on the football field."
13,"They should be banned for their poor sportsmanship.  Not the students, just their parents aren’t allowed in the stands."
14,"""We didn't lose because the other one can't win!""

Trumpian, very trumpian."
15,Is this when they bust out the genital inspections?
16,"I'm sure, or at least hope, it has died already. But anyone else remember when republicans wanted to have a law where they could check any girl they though may be trans, for whatever reason? And by check, I don't mean going back in record, I mean they literally wanted to be able to pick any girl they wanted, claim they were trans, and then, just by the claim alone, no evidence needed, to be able to literally check her genitals, to make sure she was a she? But yeah, the democrats and liberals are the molesters and groomers."
17,😡
18,"Doesn't matter what anyone thinks about trans people, making policy against them requires mass surveillance and random invasions of privacy. You can beat the queer our of your own kid if you want to be a shitty parent, just stop enforcing that on everyone."
19,Utah is full of sore losers.  Source: grew up in Utah.
20,Republicans and sore losers. Name a more iconic duo.
21,"Imagine taking sports this fucking seriously, it's a fucking game"
22,My state surprises me less and less...
23,People like this should be legally required to be broadcasted in everyone's TV without a censor just to see the reaction of two clowns (possibly three) being wrong.
24,The school district should not be verifying dick to another family or group of families over the sex of some child.. and yes used both figuratively and literally in this case..
25,I hate my state...
26,Whatttt💀💀
27,Ohio republicans are also doing this
28,"Personally, I think the blue states should start passing laws that would make it possible for trans youth and their parents to sue people for discrimination / harassment if they pull stunts like this. Part of the reason that red states feel comfortable passing these extreme laws is that blue states are unwilling to retaliate."
29,The US is so fucked up man.
30,Fucking Republicans lmao
31,Where's Michael Dundee when you need him?
32,"God dammit my brother just moved to Utah, that dumbass."
33,"Hey not everyone from Utah is a Mormon nut job, but these people definitely are"
34,"Stop separating sports by sex or gender and just divide by weight classes. If a 220 lb girl wants to play football and is good at it, let her, whatever her birth sex might have been. If a 100 lb boy wants to play volleyball, let him if he makes the team based on ability. 

Or better yet, **remove** sports from schools entirely. There’s no reason schools should be dedicating resources to non-academic or non-artistic activities and classes. Let the jocks go to a separate sporting facility instead. The whole concept of sport teams in school is some outdated 1880s bullshit.

And to those asking, the religious part of that article is that the Mormon karens were the ones all upset over transgender kids possibly being in school."
35,Only in the south
36,Just take your L and move
37,"While this is messed up, where's the link to religion?"
38,Nothing to do with religion but okay
39,Where’s the religious part on this post? The trans thing isn’t a religious thing
40,I’m going to be honest I don’t know why everybody is acting like they stripped her naked in the middle of the field and took a magnifying glass to her vagina. All they did was check her school records. The fact that the parents demanded an investigation is dumb but this is also a literal non-story in which nothing happened
41,"Cringe, transphobic and absolutely mental thing to do. But it has nothing to do with this subreddit. 

Pls post this on some other of the thousands of subreddits that are meant for these things. Don’t let this sub fall into the same trap as so many others have done."
42,"And they wouldn’t have to question it if we had separate matches for trans people. 

This is no more invasive than forcing an innocent athlete to perform a urine drug test with someone watching them pee. Which apparently everyone is ok with? 

At least in this case, they’re asking for records that indicate male or female. They’re not forcing her to expose herself"
43,What does this have to do with religion….?
44,"While vile and evil, is this religious?"
45,Based and Lone Peak Pilled.
46,I thought one girl beat up the other until I read the comments...
47,All she needs to do is claim that the other girls were transgendered and should *also* be investigated. Just because they didn't win first place doesn't mean that couldn't be transgender and should be investigated.
48,"Back in the day, we called that “poor sportsmanship” or “being a sore loser”."
49,"The fact that the right thinks being transgender is extremely common, is concerning. They don't know how to discern fact from clickbait reality."
50,A lot of states are passing laws allowing this and include invasive genital inspections. And yet they call the Gays gr00mers while they can get all up in a kids privates with a simple accusation. Projection at its finest.
51,"Looking forward to these ridiculous inquisitions to start flagging cis girls with intersex conditions (for example PCOS) which are much more common than most people think. ""Common knowledge"" says that gender and sex are the same thing and binary, but in reality these are separate traits and are each a spectrum."
52,Imagine going to a school that teaches magic just so you could keep riding your horse
53,[deleted]
54,You mean besides the Latter Day Saints crowd
55,Mormon moment
56,"The right: ALL LGBTQ PEOPLE CARE ABOUT ARE GENITALS!!!

Also the right: We need to make sure your child isn’t transgender, let us take them into the bathroom and inspect their genitals."
57,how is this even legal ??
58,"Sounds like the GOP. Oh, wait. Utah."
59,"Now She should sue the shit out of the district, the parents, everyone for emotional distress and damages. All over complete fucking hysteria of 1% of the population who just want to be left alone to live their goddamn lives. My word...We really need to root out these hysteria /bullshit merchants on the Right pushing this hatefulness."
60,Yeah that isnt what's happening here
61,"Hell, statistically, trans people are more likely to have a disadvantage than an advantage, due to side effects of HRT."
62,"You know, this already happened in Texas with wrestling.

Because Texas laws are kinda stupid, he has to compete against girls and basicly always wins because he's on T.

He is not allowed to compete against boys.

However somehow transphobes think he is MTF and blame trans women again."
63,Dicks out for Jesus?
64,"That will eventually be revived and demanded. Some more things need to happen first before parents will get on board with it. It's only a matter of time and rewriting or striking down laws. These people dehumanize trans people. If this girl had actually been trans, I can't imagine what hell her and her family would have gone through."
65,Republicans and lying.
66,Transgender isn't a sexuality tho
67,Gender and sexuality are completely different things
68,Walkabout creek usually
69,"I agree with the first paragraph. There is no reason to segregate sports by sex, because sexual dimorphism is not universal in its expression. Testosterone is generally a natural genetic advantage to sporting achievement, just like long legs and webbed feet.

Besides which, there are many sports which have more relation to skill rather than physicality - that includes pretty much all ball sports except basketball where height is an obvious advantage.

Physical attributes such as height/weight categories rather than sex would more effectively move sports into the field of a test of skill and away from a test of genetics, which is what people seem to want from sport."
70,That's not fair to the cis women to compete against men in high school and beyond. It's not a big deal when they are younger. But men are stronger and faster than women in general and that's a fact.
71,Heard an interesting alternative on startalk podcast to. Why not by hormone level?
72,Because an overweight small female has the same capability as a tall muscular male?
73,The assumption that the complaining parties are Mormon because 62% of the state is Mormon.
74,Everything Utah is Mormon... Usually.
75,The anti-trans stance in Utah is 100% driven by religion. Stop being obtuse.
76,Utah bruh.
77,"How do you think the girl in question feel?
I just hope she didn’t get harassed by others kids because at that age you can be cruel and a simple rumor will be used against you"
78,"It should not have happened at all. It is not a non-story, it is disgusting."
79,https://youtu.be/MiCftTLUzCI
80,"Its triggered an entire state investigation moron

Addtionally there are legislatures trying to make it so that childrens genitals may be examined to determime if they are trans

The fact remains that this is an ill omen, as trans persecution will continue to worsen, and will begin affecting other people too"
81,Do you lick boots like this when cops murder people in the street?
82,because the rights of transgender people matter and the vast majority of attacks on trans people is done in the name of religion
83,What does any of that mean ?
84,I saw Goody Brown in the clinic!  She signed the surgeon's book!
85,"""if everyone is transgendered, no one is."" - that goofy lil dude"
86,"Hell, its actually statistically more likely the others would be trans. Since transwomen winning sports isn't as common as bigots would have us believe."
87,..or maybe sour grapes?
88,"They also think the reason that there’s more openly trans people these days is because “the left” is indoctrinating them to turn trans, and not that it’s becoming less dangerous to come out as trans these days so more people who were always fuckin trans, have finally come out


They aren’t exactly renowned for their critical thinking"
89,"Agree with what you’re saying about their warped view on numbers, but trans is likely more common than people realize. The number of people that identity as transgender in the US is 0.6% from CDC numbers. Could be higher since thats only those willing to identify, but if that number holds, you’ll have transgender kids in every school. 

Less frequent, but still higher than what people realize are intersex individuals. That number is possibly 1 in 1,000 and includes around 30+ variations on sex that appear in humans. Friend in a small city hospital said that they knew of at least two births that happened in a few years of babies that were born physically identifiable as intersex. They said people have no idea how much more common it is, but families usually handle it discreetly for the sake of the child’s privacy and recognition of stigma."
90,Imagine having them question your gender no matter who you are.
91,Image having people question your gender ~~and you are a normal cis person.~~
92,Not to nitpick but you probably shouldn't use the word normal.
93,This is definitely on point for the LDS crowd.
94,They said “sane”
95,LDS is a helluva drug
96,">You mean besides the Latter Day Saints crowd

Like they said ""no same person ever"""
97,You implying there’s sane LDS cultists?
98,"You say besides the LDS, but, this is going to happen in every state where there are laws about trans ppl in sports. The enforcement mechanism is genital inspections."
99,These are synonyms
100,Emotional distress is a much higher bar to prove than you think.
