1,But what does obedience to god have to do with having sex? Is god asking her for sex? Is he in the room with us right now? I think she needs to see a Dr. maybe get on a prescription
2,"Isn‚Äôt she brain damaged? Seriously, wasn‚Äôt she normal until she had a traumatic injury? I wonder if she ever considers that her ‚Äòtransformation‚Äô could be related to her injury."
3,"Um...Lori you rapist apologist, that's because babies can't tend to their own needs, dishes ain't gonna wash themsleves. But your husband has two perfectly good hands that can service his own cock of it's too hard for him to wash dishes and care for his own kids himself. 

Women have a finite amount of energy and it has to be prioritised when there is no equal contribution when it comes to the 24/7 job of running the family and household."
4,So the husband is god now? Isn‚Äôt that blasphemous or something
5,"This woman needs to be permanently banned from social media. There's a difference between harmless opinions and harmful narratives, and her bullshit is the latter."
6,Not having sex unless they feel like it?? IMAGINE!!! Women doing wtf they want qith their own God damn bodies?! The nerve! ü§Æ
7,"So, husbands are big babies who can't take care of themselves and don't understand the concept other people having feelings?"
8,"remember everyone, sex is not something that is enjoyed by partners to deepen their relationship, it‚Äôs a chore mandated by God and if you don‚Äôt do it you‚Äôre a shitty wife, a failure of a woman, and you will be tortured for all eternity. she really puts the ‚Äúfun‚Äù in fundamentalism."
9,To the very religious. A grown adult man thats horny is equivalant to a whiny baby
10,They need to ban her
11,fuck your god.
12,You know she has servants and doesn't do anything she tells other women to do.
13,![gif](giphy|3ohzdEo7j242UsNTe8)
14,Why is it one way? Why can't a husband show he loves the wife by being obedient to her? I mean my husband and I divide things pretty equally. When he's having a difficult time and when I am we step up.
15,Lady your entire religion is based on 'feelings'.
16,She'll have sex with her husband whenever he wants but only in the missionary while playing praise and worship music in the background.
17,Jfc. These type of women need professional help /gen
18,Do we know that TW is an actual person rather than some ballsack‚Äôs twitter persona?
19,"Do your chores, woman. /s"
20,Unless they are procreating. She‚Äôs a sin‚Äôn
21,"So, sex is a chore that needs to be done?  

Husbands are babies who need to be cared for?

Which one?"
22,Can't help thinking she's hard-core bd/sm every time I see a post of her
23,"Hey honey how about some sex tonight?

.......

""God's will sex"" or the kind where you last long enough for me to get my panties all the way off?"
24,"I'm a bit behind on my Fucked Up Twitter Accounts lore. Is this the account that is a guy pretending to be a middle aged tradcath wife, or am I mixing her up with someone else?"
25,"Bestie, how the fuck aree you to judge others? Doesn't your God explicitly tells to not do that?"
26,"Ah, ""let yourself get raped and sexually used by your husband"". The rare Eleventh Commandment."
27,"How does this hussy have time to tweet this shit? Shouldn‚Äôt she be doing laundry or making sandwiches, or pleasing her husband‚Ä¶?"
28,"‚ÄúSome women will take care of essential house chores despite not enjoying them, yet still don‚Äôt want to get raped‚Äù wow, imagine that"
29,"![gif](giphy|Wgb2FpSXxhXLVYNnUr)

Girl this is 2022 nobody is about to have dry boring ass sex under these bizarre pressuring posts. She needs to be Epstened asap for just this post."
30,"How is unwillingly having sex with your husband obedience to God? 

How does that make any sense!"
31,Fuck this shit. What a horrible person to spread this fucking bullshit. Fuck her . I want to create a Ted talk for young girls and boys about a healthy relationship. A real one. Not some bullshit. Nothing pisses me off more than these assholes pushing their beliefs.
32,The ~~Transformed~~ Stepford Wife
33,"""Fuck your husband because it's your duty, not because you want to"" is a surefire way to amazing sex."
34,"Maybe if he was doing his fair share around the house, she might not need to clean at night and not be so exhausted thus having the energy and desire to get it on with her husband?"
35,Ah the poster child of marital rape Stockholm Syndrome pipes up again.
36,"It‚Äôs so worrying seeing women see this 

It‚Äôs like seeing a gay man defend conversion therapy or an African American saying the civil war was about state rights"
37,Im a dude and i think this is disgusting
38,She has a submissive fetish
39,God never commanded ANY of those things Lori! She really grinds my gears I stg.
40,Someone's got a bdsm dungeon with crosses all over. I guarantee it.
41,"Yeh, coz parenting is exhausting and 24/7, anything apart from that in the first few years of birth is not worth the effort or loss of precious sleep."
42,She's just admitting that sex with her husband is like a chore
43,"""God wants you to fuck me.""

Yeah, well maybe god can tell that in person."
44,"Most women take their parental responsibilities seriously, yet don‚Äôt feel obligated to participate in marital rape

Curious how that works"
45,"""make love"" is a weird way to say ""be raped"""
46,"I'm a guy, but I have a hard time imagining any woman being like this, if any girl acted like she owed me sex or anything just because I'm the male in our relationship id try to help her seek therapy because something is clearly wrong."
47,"She probably does none of the crap she spouts, to busy being on the web"
48,Hahaha...what!?
49,What a horrible fate she asks of other women.
50,I feel bad for that woman
51,There's no way this is a real person that exists. Like holy shit. I'm in awe of the stupidity.
52,"Oh my Glob! 

She‚Äôs married to God!"
53,Who is this psycho üôÑ
54,I don't think washing dishes when you don't feel like it causes the same psychological trauma that sex when you don't feel like it does.
55,"Lori, pick one. Are men so much more competent than women that they should submit entirely to them, or are they as helpless as babies that rely entirely on women to fulfil their needs? Pick one - is marriage a safeguard or an obligation?"
56,There‚Äôs no way this lady *doesn‚Äôt* have a rape kink
57,"Well, these tired women are not ""making love, "" bitch.  They are spreading their legs.  That's it."
58,I bet she enlists the services of female prostitutes on the regular behind her husbands back.
59,Is there any chance this whole account is an r/AsABlackMan situation?
60,Well - good on them.  My wife doesn't do any of that shit unless she feels like it.
61,"Transformer wife, she's a car"
62,"But they aren‚Äôt married to God, they‚Äôre married to some dude who doesn‚Äôt even help clean the toilets."
63,Is your husband God? I‚Äôm sorry?
64,God doesn't get to tell me when I want to have sex with my husband
65,Who cleans the toilet in the middle of the night?
66,Free upvote strategy: be the first to post a screenshot of a new Transformed Wife post
67,"I don't know about God but the dishes usually pile up in the sink and are dirty and stink and I need to use them. So I get my hands a little wet and it's done in like 15 minutes.

Now, sex ? It includes my whole body doing stuff for maybe an hour, my boyfriend won't be dirty and stinky if I don't have sex with him and the dishes don't whine about being done.

Oh and doing the dishes actually brings me satisfaction. (This is a joke for the most part)"
68,"These ‚Äútransformed wives‚Äù husbands are NOT going to clean the toilet if their wives don‚Äôt, so who‚Äôs gonna fuckin do it Kathy?"
69,‚ÄúMen are god‚Äù that‚Äôs disrespectful isn‚Äôt it?
70,I wouldn't listen to someone who has a brain tumor and is mentally ill tbh.
71,"If her husband punched her in the face every few days she'd probably insist it was a woman's duty to endure that too and probably her fault that he got angry to begin with.

If you switched out a couple words in everything TW has ever posted like ""Woman/Wife"" for ""Black/Slave"" and ""Man/Husband"" for ""White/Master"" , you could probably create a treatise on the virtuous and beautiful  master-servant relationship that could be achieved/restored if only blacks humbly submitted to their white superiors."
72,If you love Jesus let your husband rü¶ç you
73,"Their God says a wife is just a slave to her husband, that includes sex slave."
74,"Her so-called ""God"" raped his own 13 year old mother to come into the world so he could sacrifice himself knowing there was no possibility of harm to himself, all to renew his demand to be worshipped under threat of eternal torture. Swell guy, that one, and no wonder his book commands women completely submit to their owners aka husbands as if to god himself.

What that trash woman is saying is in fact faithful to the Abrahamic religions."
75,"On r/DuggarsSnark the family believes that a wife needs to be joyfully available for her husband (hence the 19 kids). 

I don‚Äôt believe there is anywhere in the bible that specifically states that though.

A user did this whole write up about it https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/978htu/joyfully_unavailable_a_critical_look_at_passions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x"
76,"Yes, exactly. Obedience to God =/= obedience to husband. They're separate entities. (And if the husband is [claiming to *be* God](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI), maybe call the cops.)"
77,Dude needs his porn
78,Don‚Äôt they believe sex to be sinful
79,Maybe get off a prescription?
80,Men are the physical presence of God. But only the good parts.
81,"Their gods a dirty pervert always people masturbating or having sex, gives less than two fucks about a kid with cancer or his pedo priesthood though"
82,"Pretty sure her husband's affair triggered a nervous breakdown and she never actually got treated,"
83,"She has a brain tumor, but she was mean and crazy before. His illness may have aggravated a pre-existing condition."
84,"Don‚Äôt forget on top of being a rapist apologist she‚Äôs also pro child abuse! Great one Lori, you awful, vile human."
85,"Imagine comparing getting up in the middle of the night to feed a completely dependent, squishy baby who needs regular nutrients so as not to *die* to letting a grown man get his rocks off with something other than his hand.

Christianity makes men look so damn pathetic lmao"
86,nooooo masturbation is sinful they can‚Äôt do that!!!!
87,What do you mean there‚Äôs a difference between needs and wants? What do you mean sex isn‚Äôt a need????
88,[deleted]
89,IT sAYs OBeY iN tHe VoWS!!!!
90,"Her so-called ""God"" raped his own 13 year old mother to come into the world so he could sacrifice himself knowing there was no possibility of harm to himself, all to renew his demand to be worshipped under threat of eternal torture.

91,Also from voting.
92,I love how it‚Äôs also ‚Äúdo chores‚Äù and ‚Äúlook after offspring‚Äù not ‚Äúgo to work‚Äù or ‚Äúget a workout in‚Äù as options for things we do when we don‚Äôt feel like it.
93,Her reaction would unironically be that
94,From earth
95,Hasa diga Eebowai.
96,"Lol.  ""Just lie back and think of üá∫üá∏."""
97,She's been online for decades. All the free ginger and old AOL homeschooling forum people know her.
98,She has her own youtube channel which manages to be more disgusting than her twitter feed.
99,"That's actually exactly what her husband says in response to her, but without the /s."
100,"No, she‚Äôs real, unfortunately"
