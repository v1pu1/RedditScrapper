1,"Based on the rack on Modern Jezebel, you know whoever drew this secretly lusts for her."
2,"I really like how in their depiction of the most ungodly woman, they think she still goes to church just to pretend lmfao. Wow"
3,"God: here are my laws, obey them or you will be severely punished in ways you cannot imagine‚Ä¶.. but if you think that is going to save you from my wrath then you will be seriously punished in ways you cannot imagine, you must blindly trust me forever‚Ä¶ but if you don‚Äôt show me you believe in me by obeying my commands and law, then you will be severely punished in ways you cannot imagine.

Me: then how will I be saved?

God: here are my laws, obey them or you will be severely punished in ways you cannot imagine‚Ä¶.. but if you think that is going to save you from my wrath then you will be seriously punished in ways you cannot imagine, you must blindly trust me forever‚Ä¶ but if you don‚Äôt show me you believe in me by obeying my commands and law, then you will be severely punished in ways you cannot imagine.

Me: I‚Äôm confused. How do I-

Church: God is not the author of confusion!!!

Me: The fuck he isn‚Äôt!!!"
4,"Either you believe in their fucking god or you're just a piece of shit person who is filled with lust and all you care about is sex

Wtf"
5,Note how it‚Äôs either ‚Äúserve men‚Äù or ‚Äútempt men‚Äù. Gross how the author of this sees women as only objects for men and not as individuals
6,"The trad wife is wearing mixed fabrics and eating shell fish.

She ain‚Äôt godly"
7,"They both go to church so both are too ""traditional"" for my taste. Godless or keep walking."
8,">And even causing Christian men to stumble   
  
Of corse it‚Äôs her fault."
9,Gonna buy a boat and call her Modern Jezebel now
10,This could split subs with r/inceltear
11,The godly trad wife is always portrayed as a blonde who looks suspiciously young and she‚Äôs always wearing the same ‚Äúhouse on the prairie‚Äù blue dress
12,Wait. That woman in a dress is showing HER ANKLES. What a whore.
13,"They forgot to add ‚Äúsuspects her husband is fucking around, probably with Jezebel or her brother, but prays that God will forgive her for her suspicions.‚Äù"
14,"Thanx,after reading the ‚Äútrad‚Äù wife I lost my dinner."
15,Ha ‚Äúeven causing Christian men to stumble in sin‚Äù so fucked they have to blame their impure thoughts on the girl‚Ä¶. guy is doing mental gymnastics over here to make sure he‚Äôs never at fault
16,Gross
17,Love how the font changes
18,When the cult is culting
19,"Well the one above at least seems genuine, non judgemental, someone who you can hang out with, talk too and is open minded. 

The one below will appear non judgemental in front of you but will be judgemental af behind your back. Plus she will be afraid to express her real opinions and her personality will revolve around religion 24/7. And also she won't be fun to hang out with and will talk about god non-stop"
20,"Ok, I have to point it out. This upstanding, good Christian male who is an expert on women and their role in society is named Lone Advocate Spiritual Jedi.

Let that sink in."
21,"‚ÄúCausing Christian men to stumble in sin‚Äù

Christian: ‚Äúhow dare you make me think thoughts that I‚Äôm not supposed to think, it‚Äôs somehow your fault that I don‚Äôt have any self control, you also made me spill my seed‚Äù"
22,I don't know either of these women.
23,Got to watch out for them Jezebels
24,Wojaks need to go back to 4Chan.
25,https://newfastuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7rQHNWB.png
26,Say what you will but the tradwife has an absolutely kickass drawing
27,Are these Tinder accounts?
28,Modern Jezebels hmu üôèüò©
29,Religion-: women are always objects .
30,They are dating.
31,I hate this all the way down to the white leather shoes that are completely unrelated to the statement. Is this bibliophile porn?
32,The modern jezebel sounds fun to hang out with
33,"So what happens if Godly Trad Wife‚Äôs husband commands her to dress similarly to the Modern Jezebel because he enjoys it? Does she submit to his command as god ordered and in doing so she disobeys god? Or does she disobey her husband, which is against god, in order to obey god? 

A real conundrum!"
34,Fuuuuuck. Being a ‚Äúgodly wife‚Äù sounds EXHAUSTING lol
35,"Christianity's approach towards women is **nothing** beyond misogyny and patriarchy. All it does is try to position women as both powerless and utterly dependent/subservient to men. There is no God, he's only a stand-in for immoral, self-serving men who wish to enslave half the world's population to satiate their greed and lust."
36,"Oh you know it, especially the line where she calls out slutty dudes. They don't like when they get called out and love girls like her until its time for church"
37,The Madonna-Whore Complex is strong in this one
38,"I mean, they probably didn't draw this though. I've seen this drawing around on some other memes before."
39,"Hell, I‚Äôm a girl and that Christian cartoon gave me a boner‚Ä¶damn those dirty sinners."
40,"The author of the meme didn't draw Jezebel. The ""mommy e-th¬∑t"" Wojak is quite common."
41,That one got me too. Haha delusional
42,Hahaha in a sense they aren't lying. THEY are the authors of confusion
43,They'll just blame the confusion on translation errors. Even though an all-powerful and all-knowing God who supposedly hates when people lead others astray in his name should be able to prevent that from happening fairly easily
44,I don't think their god is a fan of fucking üòû
45,"My dad got married young because he wanted to lose his virginity. Then I was born and he got divorced a year later. Christians have the same biology as everyone else, and are just as horny. It's just when a Christian gets horny they make stupid decisions based on their arbitrary rules"
46,And it's always their fault when men look at them
47,"Notice how they never hold men accountable either. They always cry when women wear bikinis but never say anything when a man is walking around shirtless. When it comes to men, you‚Äôll never see them talk about how women might be attracted to them and how they may be the cause of women sinning. Cause they don‚Äôt see us as people, and can‚Äôt handle the fact that we too experience  (sexual) desires/attraction."
48,"Women I don't like: have pesky independent thoughts >:(

Women I like: perfect servants who never question me"
49,"Christian men should also know the only solution jesus gave to men who stumble if looking at a woman is for men to pluck out his eye balls. Matthew 18:9. At no time did jesus tell women how to dress. 

So...get out them melon ballers."
50,r/justneckbeardthings
51,She also kinda looks like a spellcaster in a jrpg. Like she is about to cast blizzaga or some shit
52,"No matter how good the wife is, they'll always find something to complain about. I've seen this so often in traditional couples - women are always nagged for the slightest details (not dressing in a certain way, talking to friends, spending a cent for themselves, sleeping ""too much"" aka 6 hours a night).

It's really sad, it's always about making them seem inferior and keeping them in line..."
53,"That one stung, ooooof"
54,You ever get goosebumps from something so cringe? That did it
55,"Made me spill!? Lmfao that's how I'll refer to it from now on. ""Fuck! I spilled."""
56,"Oh damn, someone should make a christian mingle account with these and see how their luck fares"
57,Hahahahaha
58,"My neighborhood is full of [Quiverfull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull) families.
A few doors down, the have 7 kids. The 4 girls are blonde , blue eyed personal sexual slaves trained to be obedient, pump out children like clowns emerging from a clown car. If you are not part of their aryan clan you are shunned. For me it answered the question, what would ‚ÄúThe Girls from Brazil‚Äù look and act like."
59,The Devil's loophole!
60,These dudes want subs without putting in any of the work. Lazy!!!
61,I think the Trad wife is pretty slutty with her ankles showing. Why not just put her in a burka at this point.
62,And how she tempts christian men into sin.
63,It's the Kennedy Space Centre of Madonna-Whore Complexes.
64,Forgetting that eye plucking verse
65,"Damn that‚Äôs the one I actually mean‚Ä¶

They all kinda blur together at this point."
66,You can even see the bridge of her nose! If that is any indication *gyrates hips*
