1,"So, abortions are fine. The ""souls"" don't die, they just hang around until they can find a viable ~~host~~ body. So, what's the problem?"
2,"Let me explain why I title it like this.

So Christians basically don't believe in reincarnation.

But this is trying to be a pro-life story of a child trying to say that they tried multiple times to be a child even saying they went to heaven and back.

What is a problem already is if an unborn baby has a soul and is aborted then yeah even according to the Bible you only live once John 10:10 so in other words not possible. Also, John 3:13 says no one can go to heaven and come back.

Really though if this story was possible it also implies that you are in heaven before you are born which would make it harder to not believe in Christianity if this was really the case.

There is so much to this story that would be for one unbiblical and two proving as a reincarnation experience."
3,"But isn't reincarnation a pagan belief? Many ancient pagan cultures killed infants in times of crisis, believing they'd reincarnate later into a better life."
4,r/thathappened
5,"Thats heresy, ma'am. You are saying that your kid reincarnated 5 times and christians should not believe that. Guess whatever supports your narrative"
6,I was enjoying reading the first one until the kid  mentioned god.
7,"Of all the things that didn't happen, this one didn't happen the most!"
8,"People who have so little bearing on their own religion, they commit heresy..."
9,Utter BS I don’t believe for a second their kids said that.
10,"When my sister was 4 (and I was 16), she said somethjing like ""that person is not evil because his soul is not black"" (it's real, I had that conversation).

Conclusions are important here: soul;? probably her father talked about those things. Colours of shapes/people? Synesthesia! It's a really weird thing. My wife assigns colours to numbers and letters, because in her brain they are connected. Brain is fucking weird."
11,You know this is fake because kids aren't that smart.
12,I think your children are mentally ill. Plain and simple.
13,Another day in “this conversation never happened-land!”
14,Today In shit that never happened
15,"Christians are the leaders of “let’s steal this belief for ourselves one for one” or “ let’s steal this and make it fit the Bible” Yule became Christmas, any blood ritual is satanic but screw it lets “drink the blood of Christ” and not this shit?"
16,Your child… is a lying sack of shit (not really) …and you’re an idiot for believing them (actually that part’s true.)
17,Accidental Buddhist/Hindu.
18,so it’s fine to have multiple abortions as long as you have the kid eventually since it’s the same kid every time and he gets to be born anyway
19,And then everybody clapped.
20,Yeah. You certainly can’t be arguing against abortion from a Christian perspective with this anecdote.
21,"This is really creepy, I highly doubt a little kid would say things like that."
22,I do not believe this kid said anything like that.
23,"I feel like I've been using this one a lot lately but, eh, ""anything is possible, when you lie."""
24,Words are not evidence. They are words. Stories.
25,I love it when people make shit up to convince everyone that they're speaking facts.
26,"these idiots are arguing against their own stance. The guilt angle around all the other ""babies"" not ever getting a chance was more effective. This just makes it sound like constantly getting a new ""free guy"" in a videogame until you're ready, no harm done. If you're going to guilt trip people based on insane nonsense, at least ty to make it sound like a bad thing."
27,"Yeah, parents are prone to making a lot of shit up. Likely because they want to be the center of attention."
28,What in the French fried titty fuck did I just read
29,"So in the second story, the moon was able to have the baby when she was ready. That's much better"
30,Lol.  Reincarnation ftw
31,Yeah I remember my mom asking me lots of things about what it was like before I was born. I remember making things up and being unsure how much it was a game.
32,And then everyone clapped right?
33,"Someone told me, and I haven’t verified so it may be bullshit, but someone told me that there were parts of the Bible that gave legitimacy to reincarnation, but they were removed at some point. Kinda smells like BS but would be funny if true."
34,"Right?? And if it's the same baby anyway, there's literally no regret to have! The whole ""but maybe your fetus could have grown up to cure cancer and solve world hunger"" goes completely out the window!"
35,"With this logic, demons are just souls possessing bodies that already have an inhabitant and people with DID are inhabited by multiple souls"
36,Sounds like they agree people should be able to wait until it makes sense for them.
37,"I love it when Christians try to Christian so hard they end up supporting a completely different religion. (See also: charismatic Christianity where you chant and use consecrated objects to banish evil spirits, or writhe on the floor speaking in tongues as otherworldly entities take over your body, but it's DEFINITELY NOT WITCHCRAFT YOU GUYS)"
38,">There is so much to this story that would be for one unbiblical and two proving as a reincarnation experience.

Are you saying they should cut the unbiblical cord? 😀"
39,"Also, this implies that people would rather live than be in heaven."
40,Christians are the ninja masters of cognitive dissonance. The Olympic Athletes of mental gymnastics.
41,I appreciate you drawing out the irony of their idiotic stories. Well said!
42,"Idk man, that comment is actually a great argument for abortion because it basically says the soul will just come back around and be the same kid, lol."
43,Imagine heaven exists and it's like in the movie souls. Gods are just here to make reincarnation possible
44,it's recycling souls
45,Reincarnation is more of a Hindu and Buddhist thing…
46,Or was it more like a sacrifice? I dont know if the aztecs believed in reincarnation but they did used to sacrifice babies
47,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation#:~:text=Reincarnation%20(Punarjanma)%20is%20a%20central,instead%20believing%20in%20an%20afterlife."
48,"I found [this post](/r/thatHappened/comments/vwkszx/aint_no_way_these_are_real/) in r/thathappened with the same content as the current post.

49,That child’s name? Albert Einstein
50,God exists it’s just people got a distorted image of that
51,"Synesthesia is pretty fun, but it tends to be mystified since it's rare and very freaky to most people."
52,"If my mom spent all my first eight years how I was the unicorn and she had four other tries at being a mom, this is the sort of story I'd make up to put myself on a pedestal.

I loved making shit up and I loved my parents' attention.

I made up stories about how I remembered hearing shit going on around us when my mom was pregnant with me, but instead of my stories being shared on the internet (there was no publicly available internet nor social media anyway), I got lectured on how it was a bad behavior to make shit up for attention."
53,"Kids are way smarter than many people give them credit for. Obviously it varies child to child as people develop different through a variety of factors but most of the ""dumb kid"" stuff is lack of maturity and lived experience."
54,"The PARENT. 


Kids invent all sorts of things all the time, it's called creativity. 


When you turn it into a religion, it's called mental illness."
55,"Nah, the children didn't say that, these people are bullshitting"
56,I mean Buddhists don't really believe in a God so maybe Hindu.
57,Sometimes it’s the same kid sometimes it’s not
58,"A little kid might if their parent put that kind of thing in their head. I asked my mother-in-law to stop using rainbow terminology in reference to my pregnancy after my stillbirth and my miscarriage for this reason. I don't want to fill my baby's head with mystical things I don't believe in. And I don't want them to feel like their existence is a consolation prize for me after my losses, or that they're a reincarnation of any kind. 

As it is, I'm due in March and I'm lowkey worried it's going to be born on my husband's late grandfather's birthday. My in laws will go nuts."
59,Its more likely the foetus grows into a meth addict
60,That's what I used to believe. lol
61,"Grew up in a fundamentalist church in Appalachia,  no less lol...and I can vouch for this."
62,😂🤣😂
63,Christians hated Souls cuz of that.
64,Those are pagan too
65,"Plenty of cultures sacrificed babies for one reason or another.  Each one of them had a unique justification for it, too"
66,Good bot
67,"And even if they had... children say all sorts of things! Their brain plasticity is enormous, they're very suggestible, and they have huge gaps in knowledge of how the world works, so they make shit up to rationalize it.  


Between ages 5 and 11, at different times, I was pretty certain (knowing I couldn't prove it, but in my heart, it was true):  
\- that I belonged to a different hominid species that had evolved from reptiles instead of apes (because I was ""cold-blooded"" - turns out I just have bad circulation)  
\- that I was the reincarnation of a witch who had been burned in the 17th century  
\- that I could sense the presence of ghosts (I grew up in a very old, creaky, drafty house)  
\- that I had an invisible friend named Arthur who had red eyes (lol, terrifying)  
\- that I was growing fairy wings (they were my shoulder blades)

My pediatrician was actually kind enough to humor me on that last one; he told me the wings could take a few years to develop, and I was very stoked for a few weeks. Fortunately, my parents find it necessary to take up a new religion every time I came up with a different origin story for myself. These parents are nuts."
68,"At least in Thailand, the people believe in spirits, good and bad and it’s all Buddhist..

100% is a grifting enterprise just like Christianity."
69,Haha fuck. Yea I thought the whole reincarnation thing was a hindu thing?
70,:(
71,I don't define them as pagan… they're Eastern religions.
72,You gotta give the bot head pats else it won't be as good next time.
73,I had an imaginary friend called Even I think. I also once said I was a polar bear because I didn’t want to wear a jacket or long pants
74,Pagan is just anybody who isnt from an abrahamic religion
75,Even is an awesome name for an imaginary friend!
76,i always defined paganism as more of a natural world religion that focuses les on deities and more about the world itself and aspects of it
77,"that’s the christian definition, not the pagan definition. so … kinda?"
78,Well we can make up definitions but that doesnt change what it actually means
79,The word seems to be invented by christians to describe people outside the main world religions
80,"Not true, all words are made up and over time words can gain new meaning. Urban Dictionary comes to mind."
81,Hinduism and Buddhism are main world religions.
82,"Not necessarily. While, yes, it is often used in such a way -- the more common use of pagan is used to refer to disorganized non-mainstream religious sects.

In summary, if a faith isn't a spin-off the major world religions, it's considered pagan."
83,"Urban dictionary should not be taken seriously 

Pagan is a christian word and the christian definition is the most accurate one"
84,Yeah i meant abrahamic
85,Thats what i said
86,"Not really, Pagan comes from Paganus in Latin. It meant ""rustic"" or ""villager"" or ""country dweller"" or to the Roman Military, ""not a soldier."" Christians didn't use the word until the 4th century for their own purposes.

See a word's meaning was changed."
87,"Ah, my bad then. It seems I misread your comment"
88,"Hinduism and Buddhism are major world religions just like Abrahamic religions, so it’s not what you said. They are mainstream religions."
89,"Its not about mainstream its about whether or not its abrahamic, as it was used by christians to describe people who didnt worship their god"
