1,I would love for that peon of a teacher to do a detailed breakdown on how fucking Kung-Fu Panda is a Christian metaphor lmfao. My guess is she actually likes the movie and just wants a reason to watch it AND score herself God Points™️ at the same time.
2,">Atheist even after 5 years of weekly propoganda

Rookie numbers lol I'm an atheist even after 2 decades of DAILY propoganda"
3,This teacher couldn't imagine people's name could be not inspirated by a Saint. What should have said for a Mohammad or Mereana?
4,"I was already feeling fed up with christianity when I got sent to a baptist high school, and all it did was push me a lot further from the church."
5,"Funny how Kung Fu panda literally has nothing to do with Christianity, and most of the characters were based on Chinese zodiac signs."
6,These sound like the worst teachers in history.
7,"She did give us a detailed explanation !! We watched both KFP 1 and 2, and she paused every two minutes to give us the most farfetched explanation of everu dialogue. It was hilarious"
8,"And Saul saideth, “You saved me... why?”  
And the lord repliedeth, “monke”"
9,"Tbf this is just the time of propaganda at school, most of them were excessively indoctrinated during middle school and then broke out of it in high school, rightfully so. We were lucky enough to have qualitative sex education (I live in France)"
10,"We did not have muslim/arabic students in our school so we didn't have an explanation for this but it is a very good point, we should have asked her
(Mereana is such a gorgeous name, thanks for making me discover it)"
11,Yea they truly were awful
12,"God, that is miserable. I went to Catholic high school as well, but we didn't have wack jobs like that.

Narnia makes sense, it was literally written to be a metaphor. But everything else...good fucking lord lol"
13,"Mereana is girl's name I met in Tahiti, I found it so beautiful too."
14,"IKR, like where the hell is the Bible in Winx Club"
15,A very obvious metaphor at that
16,It sounds so dreamy I love it
