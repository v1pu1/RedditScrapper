1,"People stuck in 50s, thinking Bible is good and cartoons are always for children."
2,"I'd love to see these people react to stuff like Helluva Boss and Camp Camp.

4,"Where can i watch this show, it looks really good."
5,They're so terrified of fiction. It would be funny if it wasn't so extremely sad and scary that they have no ability to differentiate between imagination and reality.
6,"Oh imagine their reactions to Hazbin and Helluva! They're, gasp, making demons seem good? And angels are bad? Oh no! And they have families! Oh nononono! /s"
7,"It's always funny to see religious zealots lose their shit over shows like this, it's like they seriously think it's meant for kids just because it's animated."
8,It's on FXX and you can stream episodes 1-3 for free.
9,I've been watching it on Hulu. Just finished episode 4.
