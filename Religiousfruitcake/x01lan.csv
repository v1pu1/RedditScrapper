1,How did they magically lose this knowledge???
2,"Just because a myth guessed something that later became scientifically plausible/proven doesn't mean they ""knew"". 

For instance, the Sami (iirc) had a god to which they petitioned for male babies because they held a belief that everything started female in the womb. Pretty spot on, but I highly doubt they had the technology to observe and prove that was true."
3,"That's pretty cool mythology, if I'm being honest"
4,I’m pretty sure that splitting an embryo into 101 parts would instantly kill it. That’s not how tube babies work.
5,"8000 years ago, some woman made weapons to surpass Metal Gear!"
6,Who knew cloning was so simple?!
7,These are the same people who thought a baby was formed after enough semen was deposited in a woman to accumulate to baby size
8,"The original Star trek had tablet pcs, so back then, people must have known how to make them /s

Just because something in an old story is similar to a newer technology doesn't mean that the people writing the story knew how shit could work."
9,aliens?
10,Yep. That’s cloning.
11,Those are the biggest test tubes I've ever seen. How does one go about handling them?
12,I have no degree yet I know about cloning too.  You just get some cells and grow them in a test tube and then you get a baby.   (I assume you need a big test tube and you'd have to feed it mashed up food and stuff.)
13,"Um the Kauravas are not clones first of all. They're just brothers. That's why they all look different and have different personalities and shit? 

Do these people even read the books they make these ""facts"" about????"
14,So busy taking care of large numbers of babies for each adult they had no time to write anything down or train a new generation to clone.
15,unless...... aliens?
16,"Hindu mythology is very vast and dope but for same reason people outside India, no one takes interest in it like in roman, egyptian, greek, norse mythology. And Indian mythology is unique in it because it is still followed and worshipped by a continuous surviving religion hinduism. I am a hindu atheist myself, because you don't need to believe in a god to be hindu"
17,"Depends. The split need not be equal. For example, if 10 of the 11 pieces are empty."
18,"Yeah! Apparently all you need is ""containers""!

Do you need, like, brand-name Tupperware, or will a cracked takeaway-food container do?"
19,That would require some very big horse size balls
20,"Lots of people think aliens are involved, it sounds plausible, but imo I'd guess aliens have better things to do than tell some hunter-gatherers that embryos begin female. But hey, aliens make more sense than sky daddy so I'll take it."
21,"> I am a hindu atheist myself, because you don't need to believe in a god to be hindu

Yeah about that

3 verses from the Rig Veda translated by Griffiths.

The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking miser, without belief or sacrifice or worship, - Far far sway hath Agni chased Dasyus, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westwards. 

Rig Veda 7.63.5

O Pavamanas, driving off the godless, looking on the light, Sit in the place of sacrifice. 

Rig Veda 9.13.9

Performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra’s strength, Driving away the godless ones. 

Rig Veda 9.63.5

My bad, I copy pasted from huge text and forgot to edit out insults"
22,It literally was containers. They used like earthen pots or something after she gave birth to like a blob.
23,Anything will do as long as it only had organic food in it.
24,It takes a village…
25,"LOL, who follows rigveda even or for that matter any religious text. 99 percent of hindus have not read any religious book completely nor do they follow them completely. There are thousands of scripts in hinduism with conflicting things for the same topic including the rigveda. The only thing dharmic religions teach us is that change is eternal and in cycle. Don't look at dharmic religions hinduism, buddhism, jainism, sikhism with the lens of abrahamaic religions."
26,Who is a Hindu? Is it a cultural identity then?
27,Hindu was always a cultural identity that's why a lot of atheist who are coming from young generation hindus don't oppose the religion rather only bad practices of it
28,So can a person can be a muslim and Hindu at the same time?
29,"No, because abrahamic religions does not allow this, for them any cultural hindu things are satanic. But a person can be definitely hindu and buddhist or hindu and sikh or hindu and atheist or any other combination."
30,"I'm not talking about whether Abrahamic religions allow it or not. Many muslims believe in equality as well as in quran despite both of them being incompatible. So if hindu is really a cultural label rather than a religious one, couldn't a muslim be one?"
31,"No, it cannot, you cannot be cultural muslim because it does not allow it. Islam and hinduism are polar opposites . If you do not trust me, just post that can I be only culturally muslim in r/islam and write can I be culturally hindu in r/hinduism , you will get the answer from the followers themselves."
32,"Followers doesn't exactly portray an ideology. If I go ask about casteism in a rural area, I would get different image then what I get from when I asked in urban area, so not all followers represents an ideology 100%. 

Muslim is not a cultural label but according to you hindu is. So I don't see why you don't think a muslim cannot be a hindu, unless deep down you think hindu is not a cultural label"
33,Well with my statement not only muslim followers but 99 percent of current and earlier islamic scholars will also agree
34,"Again that's not relevant. If hindu is cultural label, then why would it clash with a religious label?"
