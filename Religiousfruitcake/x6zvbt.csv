1,And we all make the sign of the guillotine before saying grace (it‚Äôs the slicing throat gesture)
2,If Jesus weighed 90kg and was flung over 300m: /r/trebuchetmemes
3,"Basically the options of the time were like getting sawed in half, thrown in boiling oil, fed to animals, flayed, stoned, among the impaling, crucifixion and st Andrew's cross methods of display."
4,"Where'd you get that ""t"" necklace?"
5,The guillotine was invented in the late 1700s so a sword necklace would be more fitting if he were beheaded.
6,The virgin cross VS The chad guillotine.
7,"Reminds me of a great Sam Morril joke. 

‚ÄúI get loving Jesus but why wear a symbol of his darkest moment? That‚Äôs like being a huge Michael Jordan fan and only wearing a Wizards jersey.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know they make Bulls jerseys too‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI only like to remember him suffering.‚Äù"
8,What if he were impalled?
9,"Christian jewelry if Jesus had been hung by his cock and balls:

![gif](giphy|3bc5MV3VkOpMI)"
10,Can we do one with the firing squad?
11,I kinda want a guillotine necklace tho. Looks sick
12,The guillotine necklace actually looks fire though
13,I always found it creepy that people would wear a dead dude nailed to a cross around their neck.
14,"And everyone from Alabama to Algeria would be selling pieces of the ""true"" guillotine of Christ."
15,'Tis torturelry.
16,OP is The Thinking Atheist I think or maybe he stole it too idk
17,‚Ä¶during the French Revolution.
18,"I could get into wearing a nice, blingy guillotine."
19,Why is this on r/religiousfruitcake?
20,"Not gonna lie, might be the goth in me, but the guillotine necklace is badass."
21,How is this fruitcake this is just a funny meme
22,Now I need to know what it would've been if he was drowned or pushed from a cliff or something
23,"The guillotine was invented significantly later than christ.... 
Itd more likely be an axe or a rope.... but sure...."
24,"It shouldn't be a cross, let's all be honest here...

Some brown skinned carpenter dude went out with a group of *really* good male friends, snuck some wine into a restaurant, all of them get shitfaced, jesus ended up getting nailed, vanished for a few days, then came back and was fine.

We all know what went down..."
25,"I'm a simple French: I see a guillotine, I start a revolution."
26,"What if dude like, suddenly had a heart attack. What then?"
27,"This is great. Love it, and probably true."
28,My french ass would definitely become christian if this was the case
29,The cross is actually a cool symbol if it wasn't always associated with Jesus.
30,What if he was ordered to be raped to death by a horse?
31,"Peace, love, compassion, and bear trap"
32,Do you think Jesus ever built a crucifix? What if people are just admiring his carpentry skills?
33,"See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electric chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using
-- KRS-One"
34,"So on the show *Carnival Row*, there‚Äôs a quasi Christian religion where they worship the Martyr, who was hung. The priests all wear nooses and that‚Äôs their holy symbol. It‚Äôs a lot more disconcerting without the cultural reinforcement"
35,Guillotine jewellery was a thing at the time tho
36,Bill Hicks had a joke about Christians wearing crosses.  Compared it to waving a gun around Jackie Onassis and moving his head like he was shot repeatedly.
37,I laughed more than I should on this one.
38,It likely would have been an axe.  But Romans reserved this mercy for Roman citizens.
39,"Funny, yes, but guillotine was invented less than 250 years ago (French Revolution) I believe."
40,yep. or an electric chair.
41,Instead of hot cross buns we‚Äôd have hot blade buns
42,What if Jesus died by being hit by a champagne cork?
43,Lmao I wear a guillotine necklace! The reactions are always hilarious. People either love it or are very disturbed.
44,Or today Jesus would have been given lethal injection
45,"If Jesus was poisoned, it'd be a cup. If Jesus was pushed off a cliff, it'd be a cliff. If Jesus was stabbed, it'd be a knife. If Jesus was trampled to death by elephants, it'd be an elephant."
46,When you want to say viva la revolution without saying it
47,I can't unsee this now
48,Nah that's just French jewelry
49,"Peace, love, compassion, and bear trap"
50,"I feel like this isn‚Äôt quite the own y‚Äôall think it is. I hate to go back to my religious days, but my church had a big debate about whether wearing the cross was blasphemous or not. The pastor felt it was showing a symbol of torture - which it literally is. However, the congregation was firmly of the belief that the metaphorical meaning was more important - that yes it‚Äôs a torture device but it‚Äôs referring to the sacrifice Jesus took literally and metaphorically for humanity to allow his flock into Heaven. The cross serves as a reminder of said sacrifice, which is honoring god and therefore not blasphemous. The fact it‚Äôs a cross is incidental in this view - the other offered alternatives of guillotines, swords, spears, etc. could and would carry the same symbolic meaning if that‚Äôs how Jesus was executed.

For those saying ‚Äúwell what if he was killed in [insert heinous way]?‚Äù There‚Äôs more than one symbol for Jesus/Christianity. I‚Äôm sure rainbows, lambs, doves, olive branches, etc. would be used instead."
51,[deleted]
52,but he wasn't
53,"Gotta be more of a karate chop to the back of your own head, no?"
54,It's still the most humane way to execute someone. Somehow blasting someone with electricity until they're dead was considered more civilized.
55,A man of culture !
56,"Other than that, what have the Romans ever done for us?"
57,Imagine the smell of people being thrown in oil. Mmmmmm
58,Actually the guillotine was developed as a much more humane way of putting people to death cause it‚Äôs so fast. Honestly if I was put to death I‚Äôd rather go via guillotine than being strung up on a cross till it killed me
59,"""St Andrews cross""

Mmm üòè"
60,boiling oil jewelry would go hard
61,It‚Äôs a cross
62,or possibly an axe.
63,"Ancient Romans used a similar device at least several centuries before Jesus. Google ""Titus guillotine"" for a story / artist's rendition of the machine.

A sword indeed would definitely be more likely, though. It doesn't need much change to the timeline: imagine Pilatus considered Jesus a real king, and so mockingly gave him a king's death (could also be a cup, for poison). 

The symbol would be somewhat similar. While Romans didn't use huge cross guards, I'm sure they would be exaggerated in jewelry etc. to pronounce the shape better.

On a side note, I don't think axes were used for it by then."
64,Because anachronism is a total no no to the religious fruitcakes. /s
65,I didn't know that but it makes me think if he was drown to death would Christians be wearing lakes around their neck or is it a cross out of convenience.
66,The French when they realise Jesus is called Lord and King of Kings
67,"I think it's fair to say he was portrayed as something of a troublemaker and had far from noble lineage, beheading would have been seen as far too easy. Might have been broken on the wheel or flogged to death, maybe stoning considering the region."
68,"Sure, but as a frog from froglandia i would like to know, where can i get that guillotine jewel."
69,Musk bros will be sporting that when the revolution comes.
70,[Discussed this](https://reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/x6zvbt/_/inbsr3z/?context=1)
71,"He already was stabbed by a spear, so..."
72,No please; most of them already have a gun fetish.
73,That never bothered me as much as just the cross. Why wear a Roman torturous execution device? Without the man it's like they worship the tool.
74,"This is not a post made by a religious fruitcake, this needs a meta/meme flair if there is one"
75,"French people : ""Who are you?""

Jesus : ""I am Christ, son of God""

French people : ""Wait... We beheaded our king... So what should we do with a god?""

*And so the blender was invented.*"
76,It's not an own of any kind it's just a funny theory
77,As if there's no such thing as a right wing atheist...get a grip
78,Peter would have watched it come down towards him.
79,"The most humane way is gas displacement asphyxiation, ie just filling a chamber with nitrogen. You go to sleep and don't wake up."
80,"I don't now, you're apparently still concious for a few seconds after your head gets cut off. I don't think you feel the pain though. Still better than the electric chair for sure."
81,I'm seriously thinking of joining the Trebuchestian cult mom.  I don't wanna hear any shit about it; it is the superior siege faith.
82,indoor plumbing
83,"bathhouses, Rome, fresh bread."
84,Across from where?
85,r/woooosh
86,Most likely
87,I'd actually be tempted to wear one in family gatherings if it was an axe.
88,and my axe....  wait.. what?
89,And a stump
90,Yeah I don't know enough about Roman beheading to say whether they would have used a sword or an axe. I was gonna say they wouldn't have wanted to portray him as royalty but that's a middle ages thing.
91,Or the apparatus that people tortured with drowning were tied to. And that would basically look like a cross
92,"If it wasn‚Äôt the crucifixion I don‚Äôt think Christianity would‚Äôve caught on. 

There is something about the strong yet simple symbolism of the cross."
93,Not in the ass though.
94,"I mean, that's why I thought a firing squad would be a natural progression..."
95,"> Jesus : ""I am Christ, son of God""

Jesus: ""King of the Jews""

Robespierre: ""King you say?"""
96,I wonder what they wear around their neck to remember the death of their sense of humor.
97,I applaud the layers to this joke.
98,Either that or he would have had his feet cut off
99,I've never even heard of it. Way too humane for the US probably.
100,"I mean really, if you want the most painless, ""won't feel a thing"" execution possible, where the person doesn't even have to suffer the fear of slowly losing consciousness, you direct impact them with a HEAT round.

Problem is that's horribly gruesome, meaning the people who are killing them would be traumatized. Meaning people would be less likely to put someone under the death penalty... Yeah maybe we should do it."
