1,"Let's read us some scripture! Apropos of not quite nothing let's start with [Exodus 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2021&version=NIV).

>20 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.

It's okay to beat your slave as long as the beating doesn't prove fatal within a day or two. There is clearly much for us to learn from scripture. Let's continue!

>22 “If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely\[or *she has a miscarriage*\] but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows.

What's this? Causing a miscarriage *isn't* regarded as murder, only as something for which one must pay a fine? How curious that many Christians nevertheless consider abortion to be murder. Do they claim to know better than the word of their god?

EDIT: oh, and let's not ignore the fact that the woman doesn't get to decide damages, but her husband does. Not cool."
2,"I don't know that from memory, but there is one verse along lines: You shall not cause your children pain"" or smth. So, old I belive that in Bible is only what I want to."
3,Not being able to find a verse that condemns hitting a child is not the win they think it is.
4,"I’ve been beat before, and I can say with certainty that nothing left me, I had actually gained something:

It’s called trauma."
5,Killing a disobedient child on the other hand? Yahweh loves that shit
6,"Jesus Christ (sic)!

I could write an essay about every single sentence in this:
- __If you resist the devil he'll flee__ - apparently meaning: if you resist your ""sinful urges"" they will go away after a while? Yeah, good luck with that.
- Beating a child will deliver his soul from hell - I won't even. This is just wrong, wrong, wrong on every level (and why not _her_?)
- __You can't pull up scripture that says beating your kid is bad__ - well, tbh I know of nothing that says so directly, but didn't Jesus say we should ""become like the children""?"
7,"One of the problems with these people is that they refuse to believe ANYTHING but “scripture”. I hate even calling some random ass book anything other than a fuckin book but seriously, they close their minds off so much they don’t even know when they’re being ignorant"
8,They're right. I can't find it. Now try to find a verse condemning abortion.
9,You could probably make the same argument for slavery
10,Every time I read soothing like that it reminds me of the dumb medieval peasants in Monty Python
11,to live by scripture is to devalue yourself and others. nothing matters in life if everything happens for a reason
12,"Quite the opposite, sadly:

Deuteronomy 21:18-21

>18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:
19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear."
13,I dont have a verse but I have the law my dad was a cop for decades so I can tell ya they won’t have a good time in prison for child abuse
14,"Yeah, this is horrible among other similiar, but  I've also found the one I mentioned: Colossians 3:21 - Fathers, do not provoke your children, less they became discouraged. In my language, it said irritate/irk, so I remembered it diferent.... nicely shows how translation are easy to ""Edit""."
15,"With the current scotus, I would not be surprised if they manage to get ""hitting kids is a sincerely held belief"" codified into law."
16,I hear corporal punishment is making a comeback I fear you might be right
