1. Posts should be about people taking religion to absurd, crazy, stupid, and terrible extremes.

2.  Please don't submit   incendiary  posts or comments that could incite harassment and brigading.

1,"Religion is like a penis, keep it out of your parents."
2,You could plant the seeds of acknowledgment of child molestation by catholic clergy.
3,Here I'm most offended by the writing.  Weird and jarring word choices.  Though the only other place I've seen perfidious used is in Frisky Dingo.  So imagining Killface giving the rest of this rant in his pro-Jesus phase was an unexpected treat.
4,"When I was a believer, this shit seemed so important to me. At one point I even tried to “convert” my dad, who had been a believer since about 20 years before I was born."
5,"Those poor parents must be so upset that their easily-swayed child has sought ""family"" among such an unethical bunch as a church congregation.

So sad to see."
6,"i will never understand the obsession the abrahamic faiths have with converting people, as far as i know no other religion group in the world demands this."
7,"""Being good making you worthy of salvation? BAH! You gotta give the Church MONEY and FORCE THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS ON EVERYONE by voting for fascists. Make it so the Church can murder whomever it feels like again; that's what God wants!"""

Literally my reaction when I read this. Well played."
10,"It’s not at all surprising to me. Pretty much every version of an abrahamic religion teaches people that unless you’ve converted to the _right_ version, then you deserve the worst punishment imaginable. Like the person said, it doesn’t matter if you’re “good” by any other metric than that of the religion.

It is another reason why religion taken seriously is never passive and harmless."
11,Tribal mentality of us vs them. Usually leads to convert to make like one of or destroy to be the only one of.
12,"You need to add more people to the cult to feel validated, leaders like it because it's more wallets to steal from"
