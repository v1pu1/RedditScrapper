1,"Except there’s “Islamophobia” so…

But anything to be a victim, right?"
2,"Funny, because the Christians claim the inverse about Christianity and Islam.

And yet, none of this is a lack of freedom of speech. Just because someone calls you an asshole, doesn't mean your freedom is in jeopardy. Nobody I being thrown in prison for any of those things."
3,"Oh yeah, no one ever criticizes Christianity in the West. /s"
4,At least the gays don't come and try to murder you for insulting them.
5,"LMAO, what dimension does the nut who made that live in?"
6,"And yet you can walk into any masjid in the Western world and hear imams freely condemning all of the above. In fact just hop on Twitter, YouTube, or TikTok and hear Muslims both laymen and scholars rail against the evils of modernity utilizing the freedom of speech promised to them by their Western nations. Please"
7,some say insulting islam is racism. wtf?
8,"Apparently both Christian fruitcakes and Muslim fruitcakes have ""believing their religion is the most persecuted, while no one is allowed to criticise the other religion"" in common."
9,Why is LGBTQ+ always considered a religion???
10,I hate the concept of religions. I hate what it does to its followers. Making them believe in hate towards other people. Religion is a political tool. But i would never be disrespectful to the people who believe in it.
11,"Yeah, I’m beginning to think civil discourse is a pipe dream."
12,LGBT and Skin color aren't an ideology though.
13,I saw this in the form of a tweet on twitter with over 100k likes :/
14,What no one ever understands is that religious people consider you disagreeing with them AS an insult to their religion.
15,"Lol, Muslims pretending that Christians don't get shit on...and it's for the same reason Muslims do, for their own hate, hypocrisy, and bigotry."
16,Religion is a choice.
17,Does the dolt that made this image really believe that criticizing and scrutinizing relgion and its principles is the same thing as acting in a prejudicial manner towards somebody on the basis of their religious beliefs? Criticizing Judaism isn't antisemitic. Throwing dehumanizing remarks at a Jew simply because they are a Jew is. Large difference there.
18,"Who is this Christian, and why are people insulting him?"
19,Insulting any of these is allowed in freedom of speech but if you start speaking against the LGBT or women people wont like you
20,"This is so dumb, they don't understand the simplest concept of the fact that you can insult anything except peoples. You cannot insult homosexuals, you cannot insult Muslims, on the other hand you can insult beliefs and religions as much as you want because in any country which is not a religious dictatorship, beliefs and religions have no rights. No one owes respect to your religion, no one cares apart the believers. In a civilized society, we owe respect to peoples and that's it. (except in the US apparently which is supposed to be a free country but where the religious still manage to pass laws )."
21,"people can legally do all of those things in the usa due to the first amendment

&#x200B;

just because you can legally be a hateful asshole in the usa does not mean you should be one"
22,I think it’s hilarious that they equate being held accountable for saying dumb shit with infringement on their first amendment rights 🤣
23,Will they ever learn the difference between insults and criticism?
24,"No, if you insult someone it is forbidden. But criticizing something is allowed."
25,"You can pretty much get away with saying whatever shit you want about the ones crossed in red in the West, saying this as someone from a non-Abrahimic faith culture."
26,When criticizing = feeling insult then you know your religion is fucked up one.
27,Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from the consequences of speech
28,How about we don't insult anybody?
29,"I mean they're kind of right? A lot of anti-immigrant and islamophobic vermin try to play the ""freedom of speech"" card when confronted about their bigoted views."
30,"I accept everyone of those things. I respect religion as a personal choice, I do not respect when its members feel they need to force their viewpoint on others. Accepting the first of the list before islam, hurts no one. Accepting someone's personal choice to practice religion hurts no one. What hurts people is forcing religion on people who don't want it. What hurts people is not accepting valid criticism, especially when your hateful viewpoints are only used to oppress people."
31,Why y'all insulting my buddy Christian? :(
32,One will kill you for providing criticism on any of them EXCEPT islam.
33,"not wrong tbh, you say some shit and this mfs are gonna slit your throat, definitely you'll have to use your freedom of speech even for constructive criticism"
34,"Simple, just insult everyone equally!

/s"
35,"For those people, even the slightest criticism, satire or even a picture of their prophet is an insult. Those people are so thin-skinned that they see an attack to their whole personality in every corner."
36,Lol I wish that was actually the case.
37,Because no half Jewish half Cristian black dude is saying Allah hu akbar and then going kaboom
38,"What if I insult Islam, lgbt, judaism, skin colour, christianity and feminism?  a friend asks"
39,I insult everyone because I believe in equality.
40,Insult islam = chosen death
41,"People insulting you because of your ""socially unacceptable"" speeches are also exercising their freedom of speech."
42,If your religion is an insult to humanity I will insult your religion when I want to.
43,Sounds about right.
44,Insult Islam = death (under Sharia)
45,"Actually, they could move ""Insult Christianity"" to the freedom of speech section.  There is nothing wrong with insulting any religion. They are all garbage."
46,They’re too stupid to live if they still cannot grasp the meaning of freedom of speech.
47,"I made a joke about Islam at work, I got talked to about being “islamaphobic”; I’m anti religion, that one just happened to be the topic of the day."
48,"Man you can take any word and add ""phobia"" at the end and itll sound legit lmao"
49,Wym insult? Islam is the reason for kashmiri pandit genocide and my kashmiri pandit friend who still suffers trauma because of these sick ppl. Islam doesn't deserve respect
50,Sadly the Muslim community on Reddit gives itself a bad name with lukewarm takes like this. At least that's been my experience interacting with the mainstream subreddits.
51,"I once asked an atheist what he says instead of, ""oh godd yeehhhh"" during sex? While he stared at me with confusion on his face, I said, ""oh daaaarwwinnn yeaahhhh""? 

It was obviously a joke but he didn't take it that well lmao.

Edit: the fact that I'm getting downvoted by atheists goes to show that they, too, can't take a joke lmfao. It was just a joke. Calm the fuck down."
52,Their mythical little book tells them they are victims  but in reality the majority of the rest of us don't care enough to back up the book. They are like that cyclist meme putting the stick in their own front tire then claiming persecution.
53,Same behaviour even if they’re the majority in my country. We call it “tolerance is only for the majority.”
54,Islamophobia is just these terrorists playing a victim card on you ppl
55,Christianity and Islam are two side of the same coin.
56,Unless you do happen to live in the east in which case you can be imprisoned and/or killed
57,[deleted]
58,There was a war fought in the 16th century that almost spanned all of Europe over criticism of Christianity that lasted for over 30 FUCKING YEARS
59,"Except for that huge guy they call The Gay Agenda, that's why Fox news types are so scared of him. But he doesn't represent all gays."
60,The victimized dimension.  He's so persecuted he's ready to murder the next guy who calls his pedo prophet what he is.  Fake.  Like every other cult leader that uses his fake religion to dupe stupid people into letting them fuck their young daughters.
61,"Yeah, I have seen many Muslim and Christian said that their religions are the most persecuted in the world and blaming all other groups (except for themselves) for wanting to destroy them.

It’s plain old fashioned “Us vs Them” tactics that’s still work pretty well in conservative religious community."
62,Because the people who make these things don't have a clue what they're talking about.
63," if were a ""religion"" we should be entitled to all the protections that a religion gets"
64,"Mabye because we usually have similar views on equality, like feminism?"
65,I don't have to be disrespectful to them if you're criticizing their religion it's on them to take criticizing the religion as criticizing themselves
66,"I mean, when one side comes to stab you in the neck when you're speaking...

Yeah, it's a bit difficult."
67,"It’s astonishing that those 100,000 people have all suffer victim mentality so much they cannot see how hypocrite and ignorant these tweet are."
68,"I have heard some fruitcake lunatic use this reasoning to justify killing people. 

“You can have a free speech as much as you want but you are not free from being beheaded by me because it’s the consequence of your free speech to criticizing my religion”"
69,Many time those Abrahamic folk cannot differentiate between criticism and insulting and will saying that you insult their religions anyway.
70,Criticism = insults??
71,"Naaah.  Fuck 'em all.  Every last one of them is full of shit. 

Fuck all that superstitious nonsense."
72,"So those muslim play victim card to silencing any criticism of their religion instead? 

They are same hypocrite as those Christian Nationalist who using “free speech card” to criticizing anything but when it came down to criticizing of their own religion they will not support those free speech card anymore.

And those muslim who agree with this are usually from the country that they are majority and can oppressed other, same like when those Christian in America using the same paragraph but replaced the word islam with Christian instead."
73,Haha Le christian humor XD
74,"Gets a mere 2 downvotes for a shoddy joke

SEE IM BEING OPRESSED ATHEISTS ARE JUST AS BAD AS US THIS IS AN INSULT HOW DARE YOU NOT LAUGH AT MY UNFUNNY GARBAGE?"
75,You're not being downvoted because people feel attacked. You're being downvoted because that joke is just bad. I'd say it sounds like something a 12 year old would say but honestly I'm pretty sure even 12 year olds would think it's bad.
76,"Let me guess, that’s country is Malaysia then? A lot of my friends are there, they said that Malay Muslim still blaming their minority to be “islamophobia” despite Muslim are the majority and the oppression of minority still continue through Bumiputera system, sharia law and many muslim appeasement law.

Especially if you are atheist from muslim background or lgbt there, your life are in danger if you came out from being closet.

Ps. My reddit app face some dysfunction it’s reply in the wrong post."
77,So what does that make Judaism?
78,"Nobody is being thrown in prison for ""insulting LGBTQ+"". Being called a homophobe is not an infringement on anyone's freedom of speech."
79,Who knows that throwing down some people in Prague would lead to a literal 30 years war?
80,">There was a war fought in the 16th century that almost spanned all of Europe over criticism of Christianity that lasted for over 30 FUCKING YEARS

I bet you 5% of westerners have any idea of the wars your talking about."
81,He is not a “True Gay”. /s
82,"Typical emotionally charged argument against Muhammad. By your logic, any historical person who did something questionable in the view of the present is automatically a bad guy."
83,Ah all the things religon is known for
84,It's Twitter. 60k of these votes were bots. At least.
85,Free speech only means the govt cant retaliate against you based on your speech. If some nutter wants to behead you over what you said that doesnt fall under speech protections. Thats a criminal case
86,">I have heard some fruitcake lunatic use this reasoning to justify killing people.

It really sounds like you want to be the decider of what is protected from free speech or not; rather than it being connected directly to consequences."
87,You can critique all you want as long as you respect the fact that people can believe whatever they want.
88,It's people that have a mindset like you which make us atheists look bad...
89,"People are full of shit because they were born into a religion that they didn’t choose? Fucking hell, man. I get that religious doctrines are frustrating but tone it down."
90,I hope one day you wake up from your delusion and learn some basic respect for other people.
91,"I do not know the context of the statement made. But when taken at face value it has a point. Of course the targeted hatred muslims experience in the west is in turn weaponized by religious nutjobs to demonize the west. But I dont see any context in this post which would suggest it to be the case here.

Edit: just saw your edit. I grew up in a majority muslim country as part of different religion. I know these people well. But that doesnt delegitimize the real grievances muslims have in the west. And even if it ""usually"" comes from these people, which I would disagree with, doesn't mean it can be simply disregarded."
92,Its just humor. Christian or not. Why can't atheists take a joke ?
93,Its not about 2 downvotes you moron. The fact that atheists are getting offended is hilarious lmfao.
94,Atheists can't stand being made fun of
95,"That quite true here in Malaysia. The malay muslim cry about being under oppression by either the minority races in Malaysia (mostly Chinese or Indian) or by other religion (Christians, Atheist or Buddhist) while also oppressing the minority with system that favored them.

If you're not following the majority here, better be ready to live a double life until you can get out to another country. I would say Malaysia is like a less extreme Islamic State that tries to cover itself with a golden veil."
96,"Just the precursor to both. They aren't really known for trying to impose their beliefs unto others.

That doesn't make the religion any less dumb. Denying yourself the greatness of bacon and shrimp just because of some 3000 year old text is rather silly. However I've never had a Jew try to tell me that *I* shouldn't eat bacon or shrimp because it's against *their* religion. Christians, on the other hand, love to tell us that women cannot have abortions, our children cannot have gender-affirming care, or that we cannot purchase alcohol on Sundays. Muslims tell us that anyone who doesn't follow the teachings of their pedo prophet should be lynched. Just because all religions are wrong doesn't mean that some aren't waaay more wrong than others. 

Making the personal choice to deny oneself something in order to honor an imaginary being may be silly, but it is a personal choice that doesn't affect others. I can respect them for that. I cannot respect Christians and Muslims that wish to deny homosexuals and athiests the right to live, or women the right to be anything other than baby-making property.

Tldr: Judaism is by far the least harmful of the Abrahamic religions."
97,the third wheel without a messiah.
98,The forefather of those two.
99,"I misunderstood your post, my apologies"
