1,So if it‚Äôs not to save the life of the mother it was never really about saving lives in the first place.
2,"How the fuck can you write ""not in case of rape, child abuse, mothers dying"" and ""praise god"" in the same fucking sentence. 

What a waste of oxygen"
3,"Look I have people I don't like or agree with. But to celebrate death of soon to be parents due to health complications . Makes you a fucking monster, the part that gets me is these same religious people would quietly go get an abortion or pay for their daughters to do so.  As someone living in the US I genuinely fear the direction this country is headed towards . 

Also imagine being such a waste of carbon and air that you decide to use your time. To  go harass people that are minding their own business.  You really have to be just a cancer to society to do something like this."
4,">""Not to save the life of the **mother**.""

Then let them all be yours. üòÉüñï"
5,"Because who cares when women die, right?"
6,How can you say fuck the health of a human as long as this baby can grow up without a mother. If they even live past the birth. Praise God. He hates women. He hates gays. But God loves everyone equally. Just not if you are gay or a woman.
7,"I don't want to wish bad on him but, imagine if happened to his daughter or wife it wouldn't bear the same reaction."
8,"This is just plain evil. There‚Äôs no other word for it. If the devil existed, he would be this man."
9,These people are fucking sick.
10,He edited it now to say something different. Vial ass pos.
11,"I think people really underestimate the gravity of the abortion issue, it is at it's core a bunch of religious yokels everywhere on Earth waging war on half the world's population."
12,Countdown until we read about his daughter dying in childbirth after he impregnanted her and she was denied an abortion. These religious extremists are cancer on society and is the reason people cheer on the downfall of religion.
13,"**Not to save the life of the mother**

Pure evil"
14,So happy I decided to move to Amsterdam and not Bentonville. America has some extremely sick fuckers there.
15,Wish they‚Äôd just move to Afghanistan rather than turn this country into it.
16,"‚ÄúNo abortion even if the mother will die, too! I‚Äôm so pro-life that I‚Äôll condemn two people* to death instead of one!‚Äù

*the term people being used as he would"
17,ü§¢ü§Æ
18,He might not have as much fun as he thinks. Lots of pissed off women in Knoxville right now. I might have to skip work Thursday.
19,Somebody needs to check this guy‚Äôs crawl space.
20,This is terrorism.
21,"On top of this, apparently people aren't noticing but he's suggesting to have a rally at the closed Planned Parenthood that the religious nuts burned down this year. He appears to be celebrating an arson.

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-tennessee-and-north-mississippi/knoxville-arson

He also posted there was going to be a fire there the night before it happened and was considered a person of interest in the arson."
22,This is extreme
23,"""It Is more important to spite out enemies than to help our people. Praise god"""
24,"It has to be dark satire.

Deep inside I know it's not but please don't correct me. Let me have this delusion for my own sanity"
25,People like this make me question my stance on thought crimes and capital punishment.
26,What kind of horrible God are we praising here?
27,This shit is disgusting. They‚Äôre celebrating this and wondering why people are leaving the church in droves
28,Hope someone burns their celebration to the ground.
29,"This religion stuff is great, ain‚Äôt it? Completely reasonable and not batshit crazy at all."
30,"WAIT KNOXVILLE???? 

ü•µ I can go find him."
31,Looks like he's altered it. Anybody want to go to his FB page and comment on this post?
32,The bible literally talks about priests performing abortion and that life begins at first breath. This is apprehensible.
33,What the Gilead shit is this?
34,Wait... The US is becoming a theocraty to that point??? This is literally worst then many islamists countries wtf
35,Let us praise 'Murican Jaysus!
36,My misandry grows more violent with each passing day
37,Mate I hope you rot in that fuckin hell you made up
38,"Waiting for this to turn into r/leopardsatemyface when their kid gets raped, pregnant and with possible death outcome.

I‚Äôd like to see their mental gymnastics when that happens (and im not advocating it ‚Äòshould‚Äô happen, poor kid didnt choose to be born in a fruitcake family, so it shouldnt be a victim.)"
39,"How can you type that out and honestly think ""no, I'm definitely the good guy here""?

What the fuck?"
40,"Read the first half. Didn‚Äôt expect it to be followed by ‚Äúpraise god‚Äù... Why even pretend to be all about love? Just say you hate women and/or people you perceive to be women. (including afab ppl who don‚Äôt identify as women but still need abortions)

Like atp just own your shit

Edit: punctuation"
41,"Tennessee maternal mortality goes brrrrrrrrrr.

Jesus, the handmaidens tale was a warning, not a set of instructions."
42,"More of ""let's celebrate reluctant parenthood"""
43,"Celebrating at PP too, absolutely despicable."
44,Life of mother? Fetus can't survive without the mothership.
45,Not to save the life of the mother means that both of them could die. And they thinking of their own women? Like their sisters and daughters? Is it not OK to like women? What is going on?
46,So freaking ashamed of my state :(
47,"We are livestock to them. The only value women have is breeding. 

This place fucking sucks. Please let me out."
48,I‚Äôm neutral on abortion on the grounds that it isn‚Äôt my business to decide but every single time I see one of these Geebus fruitcakes open their mouths I teeter closer to strictly pro-choice.
49,"These people are trifling. Vile, religious fascists."
50,"Disgusting.  No exceptions, completely disgusting."
51,These sick fucks get off on the pain they cause women. I feel sorry for woman in his proximity.
52,Swear Jesus is supposed to have said something about ‚Äúhealing the sick‚Äù? No? Just me? Ok cool.
53,"‚ÄúPraise god, I believe that a fetus‚Äôs life matters more than the mother and am happy that 2 will die instead of 1.‚Äù"
54,There are muslim countries who arent this degenerate and mentally backward.
55,"""Praise god we can now just do whatever the fuck we want and leave other people to deal with the consequences! NOW WE CAN FORCE PROCREATION AND TREAT WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIKE CATTLE!""  


How the fuck are you so deep in the toxic shit pit that you cant even tell there is shit on your face?"
56,How Christian of him.
57,"Thanks to religion, rapists win this one."
58,This is inhumane
59,">""Not to save the life of the **mother**.""

Yes very pro-life indeed"
60,I was recently in that shithole state. what an awful place. you can tell it's run by republicans because everything was backward as fuck. only place I've ever seen. a trump store. I guess sister fuckers like the 1950s
61,"These people think they are godly. It's fucking disgusting

I'm having a bit of a shit day and I just can't fathom how someone can be so zealous as to cheer for something like this. They have to know this isn't going to last, that people are outraged at rights being taken away and will push back.

Pro lifers sure do love to celebrate death"
62,Fuck you and fuck the praise god shit.
63,"Im so glad the big sky daddy is letting mothers die in childbirth, it makes me feel so much more comfortable about my place in the universe"
64,Christians sure do love rape and women dying
65,This is so insane I'm half believing this is satire.
66,Im so ashamed of my home state.
67,At fucking Planned Parenthood? Not at your goddamn church? Man just wants to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù I guess
68,I'm assuming rapists and child molesters will also be going to that planned parenthood to celebrate. Well done GOP and Christian America. You have done it!
69,I hope he gets a kidney stone and they refuse to treat him because #kidneystoneslivesmatter
70,"What a horrible, gross, and disturbing person."
71,Absolute fucking cretin
72,Fruitcakes celebrate return of vengeful Old Testament god
73,"How do they not see how inhumane and vile that statement is? How do any women want to be anywhere near a man that says things like this?

And how the hell would their god be okay with them arranging to ""celebrate at Planned Parenthood"" to gloat about this horrific ban on women's healthcare? What is wrong with these people!!!!"
74,Can we report the church and get their tax exempt status revoked with this? Cause I wanna try‚Ä¶
75,Fucking madness
76,"The fact they aren't treating ivf clinics as a top priority for ""pro- life"" legislation tells you all you need to know."
77,Fucking despicable
78,If this isnt sarcastic than I wish all of their bullshit right back on them. See how they feel when theyre the one going through that shit.
79,"Hate living in the biblebelt...

Religion causes this..."
80,"Fuck you.  My daughters are not livestock, therefore, neither you nor i have agency over their bodies."
81,Just wait till one of their <10 year olds are r@p3d and watch them get an abortion no problem
82,Thank god that a 10 year old girl will have to give birth coz some disgusting man raped her! Praise be to the lord!
83,Religion is a cancer on humanity.
84,I need to unfollow this sub. Seeing this disgusting bullshit isnt healthy. I dont want to keep living in the dark ages with these savages. Fuck em.
85,Not to save the life of the mother...  fuck this makes me so sick. Some pro-life fucking pastor...
86,"I really need to start taking my vitamins and drinking more water, since I want to live long enough to piss on the graves of all these assholes."
87,I love seeing what the land of freedom is up to these days
88,"Sometimes I can‚Äôt believe that these fascists are posting these stuff under their real name.  Maybe they‚Äôre too dumb to understand history, and how fascists eventually end up?   Anyway, thanks for the proof, I guess‚Ä¶"
89,"There is a church literally across the street from Knoxville‚Äôs Planned Parenthood Center (assuming it‚Äôs running again considering it was burned down in an arson attack earlier this year), just hole up in that building instead"
90,"Even the most religious and conservative people I know (and I live in TN so there‚Äôs a lot of them to go around) at least believe abortion is okay for two reasons: to save the life of the mother and if the fetus is already dead. And when laws don‚Äôt even make exceptions for THAT, it becomes clear that lawmakers aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù, they‚Äôre trying to punish women for sexual liberation."
91,"There are probably going to be a lot of comments comparing Tennessee to the Medieval Era. But people were never this cruel. Abortion was freely allowed up until the fetus started kicking or otherwise to save the mother if both would die. Actual canonized saints in the Catholic Church held that belief, and St. Augustine in particular has some advice on how to perform abortions.

No, Tennessee takes it to a whole new low."
92,"This is rich. Last year some nuts BURNED THIS KNOXVILLE PP DOWN. This guy was known to hold church services outside of it regularly and has been suspected of being involved in the arson. IDK. If I were being eyed for involvement in arson, I‚Äôd maybe avoid that place?  I guess his sense of victory is just too strong to keep him away."
93,Every person fighting against abortion should be forced to adopt the unwanted babies
94,Psycho Christians. Religion should be illegal in modern times.
95,"Crazy how they claim they care for life, letting the baby live yet they wanna roll the dice or even know that the mother AND baby will die. Fucking psychos"
96,The only good coming out of this is that people will see how evil some Christians actually are.
97,The asshole attempted to change the post to not include the stuff about rape and the life of the mother.
98,I wonder what his song would be if it was his wife or daughter on the chopping block? Monstrous.
99,The shitty thing is‚Ä¶. Our planned parenthood got burnt down in an arson attack a few months ago :/
100,"At some point, we're going to react to violence with violence. And these people will be there acting like we're the aggressors, like we're the ones in the wrong for defending human rights against them.

I hope to live long enough to see religious oppressors stripped of their power."
