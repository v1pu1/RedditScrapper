1,"Which means I can't choose whether or not to have faith in the christian gods. It's up to them to decide whether or not I have faith. So they ultimately decide whether I go to heaven or hell and there is nothing, no work, I can do about it. I have no free will in the matter. Classic presup Calvinism."
2,"Well, all they have to do is stop working then since it doesn't matter anyway ü§¶"
3,"I don‚Äôt like this take, never have"
4,So also gawd that let you have cancer or arthritis. Sounds like an asshole
5,"Huh‚Ä¶ - guess I can stop working so hard. Me and god are buddies,  so"
6,"Ok, I'm gonna be honest. What Christians would call ""Sola Gratia"" or ""Through Grace alone"" where salvation comes solely from faith just sounded bullshit to me even when I was a believer. (Still does now) 

The idea that you can be absolved of all blame just via faith and that your actions on earth meant nothing was not something I could accept.

I mean the whole idea seems counterintuative to the whole ""Being judged by God"" process."
7,Religion is for stupid people
8,"according to christians if anything bad happens to you it was your fault and you got yourself into it, but if something good happens to you, it was only God that let you have it and you had nothing to do with it."
9,Meatheads‚Ä¶
10,"These will be the type of people to blame homeless people for being homeless, where in reality, god wanted them to be homeless"
11,"The basis of the prosperity gospel. God let me have all this so I must be good and chosen, so fuck you poor people who are clearly bad."
12,But remember if something bad happens it‚Äôs your fault because you exercised your free will and made a mistake
13,"Well yes because they realize that they can‚Äôt credit works if it was all god and they can‚Äôt credit god if it was all works..... so they cop out say fuck it and try to have it both ways.

This argument is the tip of the iceberg before the free will debate and let me tell you, if you want to see christians heads spin ask them how god can have a plan for everything that will happen but also allow free will. 

Like fishing with a finger hook."
14,"What a horribly insecure way to go through life, being born worthless and only having any success because purely external, likely imaginary factors. It‚Äôs the ultimate self hatred."
15,"How are people still this religious and delusional?

So all those hours i put in learn to do art was all because of grace and not grind."
16,"This was one of the many reasons I'm no longer religious. They all expect you to thank God for all of the good things and blame Satan for all of the bad things. There's zero personal accountability, which enables the abuse you see in every level of organized religion."
17,"""You have no thoughts, you have no agency. You are a clockwork soldier god set in motion running a predestined path until you reach it's end."""
18,"Jesus says figure your own shit out or we will laff at you:

*For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?  Otherwise, when he
has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, `This man began to build, and was not able to finish!*"
19,Please show your work so we can see were you had answers that differ from what you actually did to see were it was yahweh forcing you to be how you are
20,"My boss told me something similar once. ""How long we live has been predetermined and when it's your time that's it. There's nothing that can be done about that."" I asked him why he exercises and keeps guns for self-defense then. He just said, ""That's a good question."""
21,"Honestly gonna be my response going forward, I didn‚Äôt have a say. Romans road to salvation says some of us are just doomed"
22,"No prayer, no fasting he‚Äôs already made up his mind anywayyyy"
23,"And a murderer.  In fact, the most prolific serial killer of all time."
24,"‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they just get a job?‚Äù

Sorry god said no"
25,"The scary thing about many presuppositionalist christians is they openly claim their god created people specifically to throw them in hell.

Why? So that he can demonstrate his power and glory. Which doesn't make any sense cause a supposed all powerful god making a being to torture them is as petty and spiteful as a kid burning ants with a magnifying glass. It doesn't demonstrate glory, it demonstrates moral depravity. 

But these christians revel in the cruelty and hatred. I also find christians who are presuppositionalists are also openly rude, violent, cruel and hateful people. Which goes to show men really do make gods in their own image."
