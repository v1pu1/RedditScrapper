1,"If jesus existed, Jesus wasn't caucasian.  He was a middle eastern Jewish man."
2,It's ungentlemanly for a man to come first
3,"Here i am genuinely trying to decide if Jesus ranks higher or lower than America in my priority list. They're both below donuts, to be honest."
4,The fact that they cut out the hole in his hand...
5,I never knew until now how much Jesus resembled Kid Rock.
6,Someone had the hots for fake Jesus
7,Am I the only one who finds this creepy?!
8,"Bro WHY IS HE WHITE

THAT IS A RANDOM WHITE DUDE IN A ROBE"
9,You'd think he'd be first in your country too. Who got first and second in that?
10,Sexy Jesus... I could be a fruit cake for him ðŸ˜‚
11,"Personally I donâ€™t believe in Jesus, but honestly I agree. The demographics of the area Jesus supposedly came from all point to him being not Caucasian. But unfortunately, Christianity is a very white-dominated religion and they set that narrative early that this man was white and living in a desert."
12,"The earliest art depicting Jesus show him as black.  Since he was clearly not a real person the people who first depicted him get ""dibs"" on what he looked like, which makes him black."
13,"No you are wrong he looked like Dolph Lundgren in Rocky 4 and he wore the same shorts Rocky did, you know the one with a American flag, and of course a huge punisher tattoo!!!"
14,Yeah but did he cum???
15,"No, no he insists that he comes first."
16,"Idk man, a fruitcake sounds pretty good right now."
17,Why is Jesus is so attractive
18,Edited.
19,"There was a historical Yeshua in history that inspired Jesus Christ.

He wasn't some wizard that rose from the dead, though."
20,"Actually, Middle Easterners mostly are Caucasian. (Arab etc. is not a race.)"
21,"In college art class many years ago, I did a pixel/dot art project where you pop holes out of color paper with a hole punch and then glue each dot in place. We could pick whatever portrait we wanted. I picked a black Jesus. I wasn't being funny, or dogmatic, it was an attractive portrait. It's how Jesus would have been. Also, not religious at the time.  

It turned out well, except for the eyes. My art made it appear  like Jesus was looking sideways, from the corner of his eye. The best class critique was, ""it's good, but it looks like Jesus is self conscious, like he just farted."""
22,You mean Byzantine art? That conclusion is questionable at best.
23,"Itâ€™s not a fart, itâ€™s the holy ghost!"
