1,"Just for a second I thought that was Warhammer Fantasy Art for updated Dark Elves, so that they ride more realistic dinosaurs."

3,"dinosaur (n.)
one of the Dinosauria, a class of extinct Mesozoic reptiles often of enormous size, 1841, coined in Modern Latin by Sir Richard Owen, from Greek deinos ""terrible"" (see dire) + sauros ""lizard"" (see -saurus). Figurative sense of ""person or institution not adapting to change"" is from 1952. Related: Dinosaurian.

5,"Buddha is Polish invention, don't believe me? Bud is the start of Budowa or Budowaƒá meaning the action of building often used to denote a construction company (JackBud and similar company names) and Da means he/she/they will give and Ha is the dound of laughter. Obviously Poles created Buddha and gave him to the Hindus as a joke."
6,"Dayum I was born into the wrong religion, Hinduism looks LIT."
7,"Radically inaccurate beliefs about Hindu Gods, science and dinosaurs aside, this picture is actually kick ass and I wanna print and frame it!!"

12,"Sir Richard Owen came up with the name dinosaur in 1841 to describe the fossils of extinct reptiles. He coined the word by combining the Greek words ‚Äúdeinos‚Äù, which means terrible, and ‚Äúsauros‚Äù, which means lizard."
13,"Tf? Hindus have some fascinating mythology and stories, yet wanna come up with this nonsense?"
14,"I never played the game but I thought Elves wear different kind of clothing. (And being a Hindu, I definitely know Shiva is not an elf lol)"
15,No one is defending him. Most Hindus know there is no mention of any God riding dinosaurüñï
16,does not change the fact that the twitter user spreads crap
17,"IDK why but ""Shiva is not an elf"" has the same feeling as ""Satan is not a pogo stick!"""

19,A well written wrong answer is still a wrong answer.
