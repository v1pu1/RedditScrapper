1,"""They attack us because they know we're right."" 

Uh, no, you get more comments about  Christianity on an English language board because that's the dominant religion.

""They'll attack Christians because they know we'll turn the other cheek.""  Sure, bud, that will be the day.  Never seen it happen myself."
2,"Most English speaking athiests were Christian, reason being, or grow up in predominantly Christian areas. It's easier to criticize something you are familiar with."
3,Aren't Mormons also Christians???
4,O how they love a no true scotsman that they forget that mormons are christian
5,"Because y'all wont stop attacking them. 
Keep it in your church."
6,"The irony is christians spend most of their screeching and bitching attacking atheists. Despite the fact that the majority of the human population on the planet who reject their christian mythology are THEISTS! Even the majority of those who have genuinely persecuted christians are theists, in particular their own fellow christians...not atheists."
7,"Because it’s the most common religion around here, and a lot of the attacks on christianity work on all of the abrahamic religions."
8,Muslims I can imagine being intimidated by. Buddhists unless you're in Myanmar I don't think so and no clue about Mormons.
9,"I assume because it's is one of the world's biggest religions so it looks like it's being targeted along yet other religions also get nailed like Islam etc, but that would be ignored ofcourse because it has to fit the victim narrative..."
10,Have they heard of “charlie hebdo”.
11,My city doesn't have one single mosque or synagogue but it has about 16 churches of various Christian subtypes.
12,"A better question would be why do Christians attack non Christians?  I have been verbally attacked multiple times, told I was going to to go to hell.  Why you ask?  Because I was burning sage and cedar and making a crystal grid by the bay before work.  Leave me the hell alone!  I was way off the beaten path alone and they had to walk a distance to get to me to verbally insult me.  The funny part was, later that evening they needed my help and the sinner found their lost child without having to pray to God!"
13,"This is just astonishing. In my country 'India', they say the exact same things when we ask them for evidence for anything supernatural."
14,"English is not my first language. Does 'attack' mean the same as 'criticize the religious system when it is abused for personal gain, sexual crimes, judgement of others and being a serious threat to female rights'? 

And Mormons, aren't they Christians too?"
15,"People of faith really need to watch out about all that non-religious terrorism. Atheists love to blow up trains, and I lost count of all the atheistic suicide bombers there have been. It’s a really dangerous world."
16,I... I attack all religions.  Christianity is just the one I encounter most often.
17,"Well, I've never met a Buddhist who started treating me like shit when they found out I didn't follow their religion."
18,Because it's the biggest target.
19,"Imagine being intimidated by Mormons.

They believe some crazy shit (and are definitely not perfect) but they are often some of the nicest, most peaceful people you'll meet. 

They aren't the ones blowing up abortion clinics or burning crosses."
20,"""Why do Atheists attack Christianity?  All we Christians want to do is \*Manchurian Candidate mode Activated\* SPREAD CHRISTIANITY TO ALL THE CORNERS OF THE EARTH MAKING CHRISTIANITY THE STATE RELIGION OF EVERY COUNTRY, AND THEN ARGUE OVER WHO LOVES GOD, AND JESUS MORE FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY UNTIL THE EARTH DIES OR WE GET RAPTURED!!! NON-CHRISTIANS DON'T MATTER AND DESERVE TO BURN IN FIRE PITS WHERE THEY BELONG!!!! STOP PERSECUTING US AS WE PERSECUTE YOU, IT'S NOT FAIR WHEN YOU DO THE SAME THING WE DO!!!!""

&#x200B;

Yeah... We're horrible for trying to keep religion, and government separate, how terrible of us from trying to keep fanatic religious leaders who are only religious to have power in the first place from gaining more power. When you claim to be a moral christian leader one second, and then claim you need a multi-million dollar private jet so you don't have to fly in a tube filled with demons when talking about your own following... yeah...."
21,"I grew up Mormon. And let me tell you 1. they’re definitely Christian and 2. no, nobody should be intimidated by Joseph “Magic Rock” Smith."
22,"All those others are full of shit too.

Happy?"
23,"Islam and Mormons believe in jesus so.... not really very different, same thing but different clothing and slightly different anger issues"
24,Fundamentalist Christians like to demonize atheists and seek to impose their religious views on everyone.
25,I don't think anyone hates buddhism... Do they?
26,"For most of Christian history, atheists were tortured, burned at the stake, beheaded...

So much for turning the other cheek."
27,"Yes, their official name is Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  They consider themselves followers of Christ aka Christians. 

Many other Christian sects disagree because Mormons study their fan fiction more than the bible."
28,They split off forming their own thing like how Christianity split of from Judaism and Judaism split off from Canaanite polytheism
29,"Aren't schisms fun? (If literal warfare is your idea of ""fun""…)"
30,It’s funny how upset they get when you aren’t as gullible as them
31,It does seem to mean that to them
32,"You might be interested in learning about the FLDS. They are definitely not nice or peaceful. Physical and sexual abuse are rampant.

The LeBaron family is very interesting. It’s an FLDS group that moved to Mexico in order to practice polygamy. They started practicing blood atonement and murdering people that left the cult."
33,">but they are often some of the nicest, most peaceful people you'll meet.

If you're not gay."
34,"Maybe when they talk about cheeks they say it in a Hannibal Lecter way, thinking of eating them."
35,Isn’t the Bible also fan fiction?
36,"Not really. When I grew up Mormon, we were told that we were 100% a sect of Christianity and that we were the only correct sect."
37,Or just an inquision. No one expects an inquisition.
38,"And Warren Jeffs 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs"
39,"When people talk about ""eating the rich"", I look at Elon Musk's puffy jowels and wonder if Lecter was right."
40,"“no, wait, he’s got a point”"
41,"Yeah, every denomination seems to think that..."
42,"We should all call it The Catholic Inquisition rather than The Spanish Inquisition.

I think the church just pushed to have it named after Spain so as not to besmirch the religion. But, it was a Catholic phenomenon that took place under the full knowledge of the pope at the time. This is just another instance of the RCC whitewashing their violent history."
43,"**[Warren Jeffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Jeffs)** 
 
 >Warren Steed Jeffs (born December 3, 1955) is an American religious leader and convicted child rapist. He is the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church), a polygamous denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement. In 2011, he was convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault, for which he is serving a life sentence plus twenty years. In 2006, Jeffs was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for his flight from the charges that he had arranged illegal marriages between his adult male followers and underage girls in Utah.
