1,wasn't she 6 when he married her?
2,"Ah yes Muhammad, the child diddling, cave dwelling lunatic."
3,"Muhammad married a 6 year old child (Aisha) and consummated the marriage when she was 9. 


The ex Muslim sub is not short of Muslims coming onto the sub excusing the prophet’s behaviour. The screenshot shows the mental gymnastics required to defend the prophet of this religion."
4,Imagine trying to justify having sex with underage kids 🤦🏽‍♂️
5,"Ever seen a 14-year-old before?

Does that look like an adult to you???"
6,Wasn’t Aisha 9 years old?
7,"Idk what they’re talk about but at the end of the day if she was underaged, too young for him and forced it’s child rape, making him a child rapist."
8,Serious question: Do muslims kick their child out of home once they hit puberty?
9,"Alright, then allow 6 year olds to be in charge and the rest of you retire. The 6 year olds will now determine every fact for you, what you do, how you do it, what you eat, everything.

They're adults, so they're in charge."

11,Puberty happens so early. I was 11 when I got my first period. In elementary school. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. And I wasn’t even the first person in my friend group to get it.
12,"This reminds me of something my grandfather said regarding men marrying daughters off at a young age: ""If she's old enough to bleed, she's old enough to breed."""
13,"by this logic, any woman who is unconscious or in a coma but still having periods is fair game/DTF, since her body is clearly indicating that she is capable of reproducing. That means she's physically ready, and that's all the consent needed, right?"
14,My daughter started her cycle at 8 . She was definitely still a child .
15,"In case any of your Muslim ""friends"" try to distance themselves and tell you that that was 1400 years ago and times were different back then... here is their teachings from **this** century:

https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses"
16,Puberty happens at 6? That’s like sus on top of sus.
17,"Adulthood is a fairly fluid concept. Most modern states consider people adults when they turn 18, even though most neuroscientists agree that the brain isn’t fully developed until at some point between 20-25. Historically puberty was often considered the transition into adulthood - that’s why christians are confirmed around puberty and jews have bar/bat mitzvahs are puberty. So in large parts of the world marrying a pubertal teen wouldn’t have been considered odd or immoral way back when.

*However*, Aisha wasn’t a pubertal teen. She was 6 when she was married off to Muhammad. 6! And 9 or 10 when the marriage was consummated. While it does happen that girls enter puberty that early it is rare today and was rarer still 1,400 years ago. So she almost certainly hadn’t hit puberty, and was definitely still a child."
18,was aisha a willing sexual partner at nine years old ?
19,"🤢 🤮 

The only acceptable response."
20,Makes me want to scream.
21,"My step sister started puberty at fucking 11 years old. This asshole is telling me if she were raped at 11, during her puberty, that it wasn’t child rape?"
22,Puberty happens only to children and doesn't end when a girl starts menstruating. Menstruation is just one aspect of puberty. Her body still had to develop to be capable of safely enduring pregnancy and childbirth. So she was still a child and mohammed was a fucking paedophile. It's only people trying to justify raping kids who play the paedo/puberty semantics game.
23,Said no decent person ever.
24,There are 1.6 billion brain washed Muslims that believe that's acceptable as well as other backwards shit.
25,This is...deeply upsetting.
26,He also made up rules as to why he can marry a 6 year old and forced on her at 9. Its not like he was actually being forced by an immortal genie. He dictated the book he made the rules. Pretty sure he was attracted.
27,"I mean, even by their logic at least let her go through puberty not just reach it. He'd still be a pedo but to say he held back until the second she hit puberty at 9 doesn't absolve him from any fuckery the way they think it does. 

During middle school maybe 1 girl in my school looked fully developed and she was supposed to be in high school. This puberty excuse doesn't fly."
28,"The world’s youngest person to ever give birth was at 5 years old and she went through puberty at 3. Her childhood didn’t end, it was unfortunately scarred by a horrific violation of her rights."
29,I try not to hate islam but they literally worship pedophile. And our society like it's okay it's different religion we should respect them... Wtf? We don't talk about it enough
30,Yea cause 1 +1 = 3 💀
31,one singular yike
32,"If you honestly believe childhood ends at puberty then you’ve obviously never spoken to a teenager. They’re definitely children, even the smartest of em is still a kid"
33,"I'm 22 and I assure you I am NOT an adult

Edit

Didn't know this was about the wife of Muhammad, never knew her name. Was not ready for what I got myself into"
34,Guess my childhood ended at 7.
35,"this guy thinks a 9 year old isn’t a child. 

i’m leaving it at that."
36,"If they said that childhood ends at ***the end of*** puberty, then it would be closer to reality, as most people hit the end of puberty between 16-20 years old, with the average being 18 (which is one of the reasons why the age of consent is most often 18 years old).

But no, the girl was married at age 6 and they “consummated” said child marriage at age 9. It’s worth noting that puberty most often ***starts*** at 12 for boys and 10 for girls. She had barely even began puberty. It’s fucking abominable."
37,"People are fucking sick and will ise every excuse under the sun to justify abusing little boys and girls. Every person that even *ATTEMPTS* to hit on a child or groom them should be kept away from society for the rest of their lives. Children enter puberty at 11/12. If you are attracted to that, literally end yourself."
38,She was 9 years old
39,I would argue the age limit today should be 21 let alone 18 or fucking puberty.
40,"There's a comedian that makes a joke about this... that technically, a pedophile is attracted to *pre-pubescent* children... whereas a hebephile is attracted to *pubescent* children. So pedophilia *does* end at puberty. But as the comedian says--you can't actually specify this distinction to people... because it makes you sound like a fucking pedophile.

(Ephebophilia is the sexual attraction to adolescent children--that is: typically ages 15-19... but again. The distinction isn't really relevant outside of probably clinical and courtroom settings.)"
41,And lives end at the barrel of a shotgun. Let’s see who’s ideology wins that fight
42,"Wait, does childhood end at the start of puberty or the middle or the end? Do you have to get a note from your doctor?"
43,This guy thinks life begins at conception too
44,On what planet??
45,Uh. I was 10 when I had my first period.
46,"Imo childhood ends at 25. Kids are fucking stupid before that age as their temporal lobe doesn't fully develop until then.

Consent is a thing for a reason."
47,Childhood ends at the end of puberty...so around 23 I believe..so yeah
48,"Why is our world so messed up that if I hear a religious nut proclaim ""If there's grass on the field, play ball!"" and think that it's a little better than what a lot of them have said in the past?"
49,![gif](giphy|RkzMtKbCKFUY3wYRMy)
50,"i don't want to say this but if you go back in time and there are 2 tribes, you rape, kill, eat one tribe and don't harm the other, claiming some supernatural bullshit and how you should be warshiped, they'll make you a god and thousand years later people will eventually find out that rape, killing and cannibalism is bad tho they'll consider their god was good and they'll justify his actions no matter what because of the centuries of indoctrination."
51,"> Childhood ends at puberty.

So sayeth the pedophile"
52,"I got in trouble from Reddit for this, so Ima stay clear.  ""Mohammed was a great guy and people that mutilate little girls by cutting off their external genitalia, well, that's just their culture.""

Happy now Reddit?"
53,"Let us actually take that argument into consideration. Sure, back then, humans wouldn't have known about the brain's frontal lobe development and the age of consent wasn't a concept. I imagine they used a girl's first period as an indication of her ""coming of age"".

Women start menstruating at the age of 12 these days. A number that I'm sure was closer to 16 back then. Notice how these numbers are significantly higher than 9. A 9 year old was always a child.

Abhramic religions are fucked up. The Christian prophet was born to a victim of child rape and the Islamic one was the perpetrator of child rape."
54,Tell that to the court bud
55,"so that’s how these sick fucks justify this to themselves. gross. puberty is the *beginning* of the journey to reaching adulthood, not the abrupt end of childhood. to think someone is ready to be treated like an adult the moment they bleed is asinine. that can happen anywhere from 9 years old!"
56,bro im still having existential crisis at like fucking 22 yrs old. how the fuck childhood ends at puberty?
57,They still classify trans people who are under 18 as kids to invalidate us
58,"Anybody who bothers to make the distinction between pedophile and hebephile is most likely one of the two. They didn’t explicitly do that here, but it is definitely what they’d have done if they knew the lesser known word."
59,"By this logic, yiu can't murder an elderly person.  You're just performing euthanasia"
60,"And according to the text of numbers and the laws of deuteronomy, Israelite could capture and enslave or force marry the Virgin children, and kill all others who lay with another man. What's your point? That religion thought all recorded history have treated females and women as property?"
61,🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨Report everywhere including your local police. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
62,WOAH
63,Who goes through puberty at 9 tho?
64,"Puberty is in pre teen years, also that is still too young to be considered adult"
65,Child rapist and pedophile are the least mutually exclusive things ever.
66,"...and respect ends at this ""new user"". Nuff said. 😤"
67,Gross
68,"Well, he doesn't deny that his prophet was a rapist."
69,Childhood does not end at puberty. Pedophilia in a technical sense however does. Post pubescent would be hebephillia I believe is the world. Just a technicality it doesn't matter but still.
70,"Okay, then he was a hebephile... Not sure that makes it any better, though 🤷🏻‍♂️"
71,My understanding with puberty is 12-18 after that you're an adult (legally)
72,His should have too. But clearly he never developed more than 2 brain cells.
73,"Yes, childhood end at puberty but the fucking age of consent doesn’t (in most countries anyway)!"
74,[deleted]
75,Technically hes right tho theres a difference between liking children and liking pre pubescent or pubescent people but its impossible to explain this without sounding like a pedophile yourself. Credit to some brithmish comedian
76,It does. Childhood is defined as ending at puberty. After that you are considered post-pubescent.
77,"He took her when she was 19 and married her when she was 21, if not how can all Hadith talk about how Aisha (Ra) was discussing business with others and was teaching the Quran. All those who insult our prophet Mohamed (saws) shall enter hell, inshaa'allah all of them enter the biggest door of hell."
78,"without context i don't see why this is religiousfruitcake.

Edit: Thanks to those folks providing context for the post. as the post doesnt mention any one religion i was confused."
79,"Idk she was happy with that even when she became older dhe loved him not a single person back then had s problem I don't see why the opinion of neckbeards matter, of course you will screenshoot this and post it with no argument"
80,What does this have to do with religion?
81,"But...puberty marks the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence.

Adults shouldn't have sex with either children or adolescents, and I have no idea who raped whom or who was a pedophile, but taken by itself, the statement ""childhood ends at puberty"" is factual."
82,[removed]
83,[deleted]
84,"I learned this through a comedian (of all things): pedophile means any prepubescent child, so 3, 6, or even 11; phebephile is the early stages of puberty, 12, 13, 14; and ephebephile is the later stages, 15, 16 and 17. Or something like that, I might have them backwards.

So technically they'd be correct I guess, but still totally an unnecessary distinction."
85,"…That just makes him an ephebophile.

^Welcome ^to ^Mogeko ^Castle! ^AKA ^Mine!"
86,"That's correct. Childhood ends at puberty.





Puberty doesn't end until 20-26 years of age,  so unless this person was over 20, they were still a child."
87,"Yes. He married her at 6, and consummated the marriage at the age of 9. 


According to the individual in the above ss, she apparently started her period at the age of 9, which would make her an ‘adult’ therefore, there is nothing wrong with an old man having sex with a child."
88,He was also in his 50s at least at the time.
89,"Yeah but you have to think of it in terms of Predator logic.

*""If it bleeds, we can fuck it!""*

Just.. y'know. Different kind of predator..."
90,"Ha, I thought we were talking about R. Kelly."
91,Pedo Muhammad can go fuck himself
92,"There was a [post earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/x80hzx/sometimes_religions_indoctrination_are_too/), where a presumably ""ex"" Muslim was claiming that he was an ex-Muslim, but he still loved all of the LGBTQ hate and bigotry, then complained about people calling him a terrorist because he ""used"" to be a Muslim, and then openly admitting that he literally supports and donates to terrorist groups. Kinda hard to tell if troll, but still absolutely believable and seemingly earnest."
93,Yep. I’m ex Muslim and I’m on that sub and the kinda shit people make up to justify this is almost worse than the action itself.
94,"> defend the ~~prophet~~ pedophile of this religion

FIFY"
95,Is it defending the prophet or defending MEN who rape children ?
96,"wait, i thought aisha was 9 when they married?

also, what does consummate mean?"
97,"His first wife was 15 years older though?


And I like how this is the biggest argument Islam critics think of now, when the people who were opposed to him at the time never even brought it up, considering it was the actual norm for their time. Whether it be customs or that the lifespan was not that long, fact remains that it was not uncommon. 


Now can you apply marrying a girl thag the paradigm of today - not anymore than you can apply the rules from the segregation of the 50's America (well some states in the US actually allows marriage way below 16 with parental consent, but I digress). 


Fun fact, Queen Margrethe I of Denmark was wedded to the king of Norway when she was 6. (Also Denmark had legalized child porn until the late 80s, but that's another talk entirely)


I anticipate your shit storm lmao, peace."
98,"But but but *My religion said the prophet did it so that means I can fuck kids too! It’s part of my religious freedom!**

Edited to add /s because there’s always that *one person* on every post that takes shit way too seriously."
99,And then there's a whole cult following him and defending him to the point they would murder for that.
100,The only thing worse is living in a culture in which you don't even need to try to justify it.
