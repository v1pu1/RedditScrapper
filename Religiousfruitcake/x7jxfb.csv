1,but you can't love someone without respecting them. what do these people think love is?
2,"Love without respect seems like it'd be a pretty shallow thing. Not sure I'd even call it ""love""."
3,"All the more reason not to adhere to religious doctrine as a lady myself. Why would I work against my own interests? I don’t necessarily respect religious wives either. If your own husband and society as a whole doesn’t respect you as a religious wife, why would you continue to adhere to that belief system? Never made any sense to me. Then again, I’m not trying to live life as an abused martyr. All religion is just illogical nonsense designed to give legitimacy to the standing ‘social order’. Christianity is all about control."
4,"> Conservative marital witchcraft

What in the unholy lordie-loo?"
5,">He didn't say to respect your wife, God said to love your wife

I understand all those words separately"
6,"Lmao 

loveisrespect.org"
7,Whatever
8,"i'm telling you, man. what christians call ""love"" ain't love."
9,"Love without respect is something you have for like a pet or ( debatably ) an extremely young child. Gross. 

( Even then, I respect my pets to a small degree anyhow. I sure as hell can't walk naked outside in winter or fall from multiple times my own height and land gracefully like my cat. )"
10,..if you love someone don't you also respect them??
11,"“Conservative Marital Witchcraft”

…What?"
12,God sounds like an asshole
13,God told me last night that Toby Sumpter should give me all his money. If he were a true Christian he’ll listen to God
14,"""How to be an insecure tyrant because some old geezer from the backpages of the Bible said to"""
15,Isn't love something that goes hand and hand with respect? Meaning that if you love someone you respect them...
16,you can love and respect your wife at the same time. imagine that!
17,"I don’t know. I read it as “don’t just respect your wife - love her.” But I don’t know the guy’s history, so I might be missing context"
18,"Ugh, now i know how he feels about Ciara and Russell Wilson then."
19,Possibly doing what He wants without discussion.
20,"they love you the way one loves a prized possession. To be shelved and used whenever they want, because they love it THAT much"
21,Exactly. Mutual respect is the first level of developing any relationship. It's simply acknowledging that they are also human and treating them with diginity.
22,"The Abrahamic faiths have a severe lack of empowered women problem. Especially in Islam, less so in Judaism. Judaism has women heroes. But if you weren't raised Jewish, you don't have access to the oral traditions, all you see is the written word of men being bumbling clowns.

The god of the Old Testament has Sumerian roots. The Sumerians believed in a Flood God. But they also believed in other gods. And goddesses. Like Ishtar, goddess of love and war, goddess of the virgin and the whore. She was popular with women, she was popular with queer people of that day and age, too.

Jesus' mother was a virgin and his wife was a sex worker. If there was a church that celebrated them, that would be a lot more appealing."
23,I saw that too and I'm throughly confused.
24,That's disrespectful. And disrespecting them is the opposite of loving them.
25,"...So they don't want wives, they want human pets."
26,"Mary Magdalene wasn't a Sex Worker, that idea of her was from Pope Gregory II. He was giving a sermon on how women should be and made up she was a prostitute.

""You can be like our Holy Virgin Mary or Mary Magdalene, the WHORE!"" Bullshit like that."
27,Same here — those three words do *not* sound like they have any business being associated with each other.
28,But they think respect is the opposite of love
29,"yep. The whole ""other kind"" thing in these circles is more literal than you might think. From the perspective of these people, women's brains are wired so differently they're a different kind of human, so oF cOuRsE they wouldn't treat them the same way."
30,Heck there's no proof that Jesus got married. Atleast according to the Bible. People shouldn't make false claims against something even if you hate it.
31,"And even if she was a sex worker, so what? Sex work is a far more honest and noble profession than a fucking clergyman who sells imaginary god shit. Pope Gregory would have been far more respectable if he got a proper job, like sex work or accounting."
32,"I'm not saying sex work is bad, put your pitchforks away. I'm using the facts (I know funny to apply) of what is written of the Character of Mary Magdalene."
33,"I didn't say you said sex work is bad, out your pitchfork away. I was talking about the paedo leader."
