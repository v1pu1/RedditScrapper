5,"I've met quite a few. My best friend is a pagan and I followed them to a few pagan groups to observe and learn out of curiosity. I wouldn't really mind a pagan run government if I absolutely HAD to have some kind of religion in my government. Pagans tend to care about the environment, tend to be pro-LGBT+, tend to refrain from forcing their beliefs on others, tend to be pro-human rights, etc. Almost polar opposites from how the Abrahamic religions tend to behave."
