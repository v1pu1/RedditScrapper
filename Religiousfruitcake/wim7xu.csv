1,Their god doesnâ€™t mind rape at all as long as you pay the fee.
2,Even though God didn't mind about rape as long you paid to your rape victim's dad and marries your rape victim [Link proof](https://biblia.com/bible/niv2011/deuteronomy/22/28-29)
3,I choosed homosexualism
4,"I've had Muslims tell me that I was lying by quoting directly from the Quran, claiming, ""Oh, that's hadith, it doesn't count."" Except, I wasn't quoting hadith, I was quoting the actual Quran. Then they tell me what it ""really means"" and then when I use their own ""interpretation"" of the Quran to make another counter-point, then they tell me once again that wait, it doesn't mean that, and \*I'm\* interpreting it wrong. Basically, if you're criticizing Islam, or general Abrahamics in any way, then no matter what, you're always reading it the ""wrong"" way. Same thing with their hadith. ""That hadith"" never counts if you're using it to point out fucked up shit in Islam. But they'll turn right around and then quote from that same hadith."
5,If sexuality was  a choice we'd have waaaaaay more lesbians.
6,	Ask this ass clown where Jinn are mentioned in Genesis.
7,">We have free will to choose

Nope. I might, maybe, but you absolutely donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not possible for your god to exist and you to still have free will. Your god makes free will impossible."
8,What do they call it when priests does them?
9,Donâ€™t blame you. These people are too far gone to be worth your time.
10,Good grief. This person would not pass a mental heath assessment.
11,"If you think this is bad, debate vegans for a while.

That shit fucks with my brain, especially when they say they have more experience with animals than me. (I'm a farmer BTW)"
12,Rorschach speak
13,"Christians will forgive any sin, as long as you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior."
14,"Minor detail, concerning the 4th or 5th version there: The man didn't ""violate *her*"". The man damaged another man's (her father's) *property*. In the Bible, rape isn't a crime against a woman, it's a property crime against the woman's *owner*."
15,Congratulations !
16,Me choosed homosexualism too
17,"Yep! I'm always amused when, in talking to Christians about the Bible-- typically as ""the inerrant Word of God"", but sometimes ""the inspired Word of God""-- and I quote something from the Bible, they invariable tell me I'm either reading it wrong, ""interpreting it wrong"", or I'm incapable of ""understanding properly"". 

WELL, if their God is omnipotent and omniscient, *surely* it would be capable of either forcing all those who wrote the Bible to stick with the same story, or at least ""inspire"" them to do so. When anything is left up to ""interpretation"", it can be interpreted any way an individual *wants* to interpret it. I'm perfectly capable of understanding absolutely anything that makes sound logical and sane sense, *including* the fact that they ask believe a bunch of illogical bullshit that can never be substantiated. They can keep their ""beliefs"". I'll stick with the facts."
18,This!!!! I wouldn't think twice about it.
19,This ass clown is probably a Muslim and therefore doesn't care much about Genesis (and jinn ARE mentioned in the Quran).
20,Oh goodness I donâ€™t even wanna go down THAT rabbit hole ðŸ˜«
21,Thatâ€™s the problem unfortunately
22,"""Ok, i forgive you, unless you don't join us"" in a nutshell"
23,Yeah no that's not gonna happen
24,I don't need him to realize if I've done something wrong. The dead should not govern the living
25,"Yeah, no, I don't want to be forgiven by a freak who gets off on seeing his son nailed naked to a cross.

Now, if *god* wants to ask *humans* for forforgiveness for all the terrible things he did out of narcissism and getting aroused seeing people suffer, then we can talk."
26,"Is it good this homosexualism, can I join?"
27,">WELL, if their God is omnipotent and omniscient, surely it would be capable of either forcing all those who wrote the Bible to stick with the same story, or at least ""inspire"" them to do so.

Nope. God wants you to translate it from Aramaic/Hebrew into English and then divine his master plan by assigning numbers to the English letters and then adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying them in random ways."
28,"OK. That makes more sense, but theyâ€™re still an ass clown"
29,***\*Thanatocracy intensifies!\****
