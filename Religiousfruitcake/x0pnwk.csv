1,Wait. Let me get this straight. Males and females of each species have evolved separately according to their world views? How would that even work?!
2,"They're never taught how evolution works, they're just fed a steady diet of ridiculous lies. Then when they regurgitate those lies they feel all smug and smart."
3,It's no surprise people like this have a hard time understanding sexual reproduction.
4,It's like a house of cards built on ignorance and indoctrination.
5,"Ever heard of sea sponges?

They reproduce by themselves aka asexual reproduction.

They existed way longer before any creature started to walk on land."
6,Tell me you no nothing about evolution without telling me you no nothing about evolution.
7,"I came in a lifeless rock, so what? Oh, wait, came *from* a lifeless rock. Never mind."
8,"Number 9 does not have to do with *evolution*

What they are talking about is *abiogenesis*

*Evolution* is how living things change"
9,"How is them evolving simultaneously not what crossed his mind?

Heres how it happened

When sexual reproduction evolved both sexes were exactly the same. Theyd equally exchange genes with each other. Over time it got more efficient for one of them to exclusively accept the genes and the other to  exclusively give them. Thus they are female and male

Theres a biological law, i forget the name, which states that in an organism where only one sex receives the genes, that sex will evolve to accommodate the offspring. Be it something like seeds, eggs or live birth

As for that last one it is logical to make the conclusion that life came from lifeless matter as we are made of lifeless matter, them being atoms, and these non living atoms had to come together to form something we would call living"
10,"Everytime I see some stupidity like this, it makes me question my resolve on not drinking, cause good grief the stupidity hurts"
11,It's hard to discuss evolution with someone who's understanding of evolution so completely wrong.
12,This person could have saved so much time and embarrassment with one Google search.
13,I donâ€™t think this person has sex
14,"I mean, a species wouldnâ€™t be alive if neither of them found a mate so I guess thatâ€™s also an evolutionary pressure"
15,"Funny thing is that the fact males and females exist is already proof for evolution. 



If evolution didn't exist there would be one prototype person and everyone would be an exact copy of that person."
16,"What's even funnier is they also do sexual reproduction by shooting sperm out into the great wide ocean... (at least, certain species do)

So the terms ""male and female"" actually evolved after the male and female sexual cells!"
17,*know
18,I'm honestly not even surprised anymore that they conflate those two theories. They don't even understand the most simple aspects of evolution.
19,That would suggest they had a brain
20,Not that I agree with guy in the pic but how does the existence of males and females prove evolution?
21,"Well, there are some organisms that reproduce asexually like that one female lizard."
22,know u
23,"""*know""-ðŸ¤“"
24,"It's funny when they say ""evolution isn't true because we haven't directly observed it"" and yet say ""we can't observe God we have faith"""
25,"All evolution is, is genetic mutations during reproduction. 




Without evolution dna doesn't mutate.  




So every offspring must me an exact copy of their parent. 




With two parents, you can't be an exact copy of both."
26,"The existence of males and females is not so much the indicator of evolution as is the existence of a better way to promote genetic diversity. Before the existence of sexual reproduction, an important facilitator of genetic variety, and thus natural selection, genes just happened to mutate randomly. Errors in gene replication and damage to DNA (or RNA, as most ancient prokaryotes used) from the environment led to changes in organisms. These changes, called mutations, happened randomly before sexual reproduction, and these mutations were (essentially) passed down to offspring based on their effect on an organism's survival: negative mutations are less likely to be passed down because the organism bearing that genetic material is more likely to perish before being able to produce offspring, and other mutations (neutral mutations exist) are more likely to be passed down.  


Sexual reproduction allows for the deliberate recombination of genetic material; it's an extremely beneficial tool, evidently. It evolved early on, enough so that the odds of all sexually reproducing eukaryotic organisms likely came from a single, sexually reproducing ancestor. The existence of males and females proves evolution by being a mechanism for more frequent gene recombination, leading to new lines of genetic material that can be passed down over the course of time to lead to new species."
27,The funny part is that we *can* observe evolution
28,The funny part is that we *can* observe evolution
29,The funny part is that we *can* observe evolution
30,"You are partially correct; reproduction is a MAIN driver for evolution, but before that we had random chance mutations inflicted by the environment or errors in gene replication. Tell me, how did we evolve sexual reproduction without first having sexual reproduction?  


The accepted idea is that protocells, clusters of macromolecules capable of self-replication, eventually encountered errors in the gene replication process that caused them to differentiate. Eventually, enough of these errors resulted in sexual reproduction; this error, like other errors that led to the current variety of life on Earth, turned out to be beneficial for the survival of the species, and so the ancestors of modern animals evolved sexual reproduction. To address the original image's take on sexual reproduction evolving separately throughout all animals, it's more like sexual reproduction was one of the first things to be evolved before organisms started to deviate; why would plants have sexual organs? Although I can't say the same thing about mushrooms, since I'm pretty sure any hyphae can combine with the hyphae of another mushroom to recombine DNA."
