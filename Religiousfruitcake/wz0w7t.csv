1,"This is really disheartening and cruel.
It’s on every post about George, who is beloved by many people who listened to his music for decades.

In May, it happens also with Shireen, she was a journalist icon who we, Palestinians, loved like a family member. And people like this told grieving people “you can be sad but she’s going to hell despite her giving her whole life and career for your rights and you can’t pray for her”

It happened again two weeks ago when an Egyptian church burned down in an electrical fire and maybe 40 worshippers died. 

They can’t keep their cruel beliefs to themselves, they have to tell you to be cruel with them while you’re processing your grief. 

It’s fucked up."
2,"reminds me of catholic school when a classmate's sibling died by suicide, and they asked the principal (a nun) if they could mention him in morning prayers and she said NO bc committing suicide is a sin and he wasnt going to heaven. imagine telling a CHILD that, who just lost their brother. fk that!"
3,"Self righteous exclusiveness; the hallmark of cult behavior. Once it gets big enough they stop calling it a cult though. 

So said every ""prophet"" ever; ""Believe what I say god got meant when he wrote this book (or wrote it through me, or I found it under a rock or  whatever) or burn in hell for eternity!"""
4,But the Muslim allah and the Christian god are the exact same deity. What is the problem?
5,Allah and God are the same thing
6,You clearly faking it
7,It's fascinating how many people wish eternal gruesome torture on people for relatively harmless offenses. And they see themselves as righteous instead of evil.
8,That’s horrible and I’m sorry for your classmate. This happens all the time when a Muslim commits suicide too. My friend from college lost his brother that way and it was a horrible experience having to deal with that kind of mentality. We stayed around him and supported his grief.
9,"Oh that’s a can of worms you just opened. According to most Muslims, Christianity was right and that they also worshipped Allah. That’s to them Jesus’s message. However, they see that Christianity, and Judaism, we’re corrupted along the way and the current Christianity is not true Christianity, and that the idea of the trinity is a proof of that. So Allah to them is not the same as the current Christian idea of Allah."
10,Please. Faking what exactly?
11,At this point it just seems like most of them are bred and raised to be sociopaths.
12,"thats great u guys gave him a support system. i really hate this ""do everything we say, or we're throwing your eternity in the toilet"" intolerance of religion in general. t has become less about being good and helping lift eachother up, to using it as a weapon against others and feeling superior to someone else. 

faith should be a place of solace when u r at ur lowest, and instead, we kick ppl when they're down? how is that ok in any religion?"
13,That IS religion
