0,Do you realise she has been reigning for 70 years and India got independence like 75 years ago
1,"Given how Indians feel about Beefeaters, their disdain for the Queen is understandable"
2,India wasn't even a country until the British arrived.
3,"But the royal family of Britain inflicted heavy loss on our country ( both in loss of life and wealth) and the people of India still mourn her death is what I find somewhat bigotry ( Britishers looted huge wealth from our country some of which still resides in the British museum they even looted the word loot itself)
If Britishers wants to portray them as so good why not give an apology to India and return our treasures"
4,Like seriously? India is really I don't know literally how many centuries older maybe dating back to the Indus valley civilization or the Vedic period. Even before the invasion of Britaish we had the highest GDP in the world just Google it.
5,"To clarify, i am Indian and just because they did stuff all those decades ago doesn't mean we should blame those who had little to no hands in it, it's just stupidity to blame someone for someone else's sins"
6,In addition to my previous reply [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/x9p789/lizzy_was_the_queen_while_countries_including/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) something else
7,"Dude, let it go.

If weâ€™re going to hate on every single nation that did horrible things in their past - we might as well burn down the civilization. History is paved in blood. Always has been."
8,So you mean I can loot your house kill your family and later divided your land. While my ancestors who still enjoys the wealth I stole from you just give an apology letter and that too not specifically ment for you but for all the houses I looted and places I burnt on my way and ya it's all pardoned.
9,Well all I am asking for an apology like the German did to the Jews or usa did to Japan.
10,Well it's not their fault do i wouldn't hold any grudge towards them but i would want revenge from you
11,"Nobody cares what you want.

If you want an apology - grind hard, become the leader of a nation and then demand whatever (assuming even then Leaders will listen to you) you want."
12,And what about your stolen fortune which you and your ancestors had built over the years?
13,I guess that's true
14,"What kind of a dumbass take is this? ""If you want an apology you gotta work at it, you gotta grind man"" this doesn't undercut him wanting the apology, and he has every right to hate the country I was born in as well as the rich family that are its mascot. 

Many indians want what he wants, and they have every right to be happy at this moment."
15,"Money is just temporary, you can earn it back if you're smart enough.

I get your point but stop being stupid toxic ""nationalist"""
16,"Nobody cares about you wanting an apology, sorry to break your fragile skin."
17,Well it's upto your belief but I think Britishers own us an apology that too on world stage and be specially for us not in general.
18,"I don't want an apology. I'm not Indian, proudly British actually :') I'm just not some fragile redditor who starts telling someone to become a world leader when they just state that they want an apology."
19,"So you're still saying stupid stuff... Anyways i wish you luck in life and hope your orthodox mindset changes, i won't be replying again. Bye"
