1,"A loser is someone who doesn't try to improve themselves and blames others for his failure. It's normal to fail, but not normal to not try to improve! üëë"

3,10/10
4,"Iam surprised ""play videogames"" isnt on the list, that usually makes it onto such bullshit lists lol"
5,"As long as you're happy, it really doesn't matter if you are a loser or not."
6,"All of these, ""be a man by not watching porn and not trying to get laid,"" things are generally made by really weird people. I remember participating in the NNN subreddit one year and then some dude kept messaging me throughout the year encouraging me to stop jerking off altogether and asking me if I had adjusted or cut back my beat schedule... 

I'll happily be a loser."
7,"Well, thank you for fueling my self-hatred even more."
8,"I'm not a loser because i watch porn. i mean i am a loser, but not because i watch porn"
9,"At this point, I‚Äôm not a loser, I‚Äôve just plain lost."
10,"1, 2, 6 and 10. That's 4/10 but I feel like to apply to almost everyone

1. Everyone watch porn. 95% of people admit they watch porn and 5% are fucking liars

2. Most people don't work out. Working out is the exception, not the rule.

6. Anyone unemployed or in vacation sleep late. What's the point of waking up at dawn if you don't have too ?

10. What's lazy ? Is chilling in couch lazy ? Is it physical and working on IT lazy ?

People, you are not losers. You're just people"
11,This loser/winner shit screams american nevrosis
12,"When I saw the OG post, it kinda broke me because I knew that was me"

30,6/10
31,Isn't 3 an 9 the same?
32,Only the first and 7th one applies to me.
33,"9 and 10 usually within reason though. Have to be a bit more practical as an adult. Also laziness is sort of dependent on who you ask. Am I ""lazy"" just to be lazy? No. A lot of the time I just don't have energy but I am working on myself every day. 


As for 9 it's okay to take your time and figure out what you want to do in the first place. I am glad I waited to go to college, cause now I feel like I won't waste money trying to figure out what I want to do before I am ready."
