0,"I mean, people made memes about technoblade dying, who was a better person in my opinion (raised thousands of dollars for cancer research), so I‚Äôm not surprised."
1,Sensitivity and respect has never been this subreddit's strong suit.
2,"Theres nothing wrong with making jokes. Sometimes humor is what someone needs to lift their spirits. The majority of people genuinely respect her, and she will go down as one of the most influencial persons to date. Sometimes we just need a bit of a laugh. Besides Her Majesty was a humourous person. I am sure she'd enjoy some of these memes."
3,I pressed both of them.
4,Well it's not like the dead are gonna do anything about you disrespecting them.
5,"Honestly im not british but it just shows how boringly unoriginal people are. One person makes a joke fine, people may laugh but a thousand making rhe same joke? Meh"
6,"As long as the meme is tasteful.  Some will be disrespectful, but that‚Äôs the price we pay for humor."
7,Ratio+ queens dead
8,She will never be forgotten. Rest in peace
9,Shes a colonizer fuck her lmao you really think im going to respect that filth?
10,It‚Äôs not disrespectful until people start making memes with the intent to be disrespectful.
11,"I‚Äôll respect the grieving family all day long but there is zero reason outside of cultural tradition to ‚Äúrespect the dead.‚Äù Just because you died doesn‚Äôt mean you were a good person worthy of respect. If you would have talked shit yesterday, talk your shit today too."
12,memes makers don't know what respect mean
13,"I have 0 respect for monarchs, alive or dead."
14,Nah it's revenge for what happened in 1812
15,"I know, like I posted something on a post about how like they were happy she died  about just respect that someone died and a bunch of people are commenting like ‚Äúlol why???‚Äù And like about how she did terrible things like I get that but if you don‚Äôt care she died just don‚Äôt say anything üíÄ"
16,Just because we make memes of here doesn't mean we're not respecting her
17,"You'll never catch me or a single one of my Irish Catholic family paying respects to the Queen of England. Good riddance to bad rubbish, and I hope the castle falls down behind her."
18,ooohh
19,"All the jokes are lauding her, thats as respectful as ive ever seen the internet"
20,Respect os earned. She's done nothing to gain my respect. But she's done plenty to lose it.
21,How about both?
22,What's with this strange belief that she was a good person? With all the fucked up shit that's happened in the royal family? Just the concept of a monarchy in 2022.
23,\*cough\* This is Reddit
24,And here you are‚Ä¶
25,"Bro, its reddit"
26,"Making memes is kinda a way to show respect, or at least recognition. If your death has a massive cultural impact, then you know you have lived a great life."
27,"""The internet"" is not America."
28,There‚Äôs a reason the bottom of a pyramid is the largest part. Most people are classes idiots.
29,"People tend to make jokes in dark situations lighten the mood, making people feel less sad and try to cheer them up after a bad situation. Doesn't mean no one doesn't respect Queen Elizabeth."
30,You live with your mortality everyday who cares
31,What the fuck has the queen done?
32,but u just did that.
33,I just think about how much of a legend she was and how all the neck beards with the disrespect are ganna die with little to no one caring.
34,"Sadly, respecting people doesn't make memes"
35,Technoblade wasn't the queen js
36,It's a defence mechanism
37,"&#x200B;

\* when u see UK ranting ''y cant u guyz forget abt a few hundred yrs of repression and show some respect to the dead its not like she was bad or somethin u see royals cant return the robbed items back'' \*"
38,"It‚Äôs one thing to make memes about it, but a whole other thing to say things like good riddance"
39,You know you had a big impact on the world when people make memes about your death. Sometimes people just need to show their feelings in the most unconventionally funny way possible.
40,The dead is dead not like theys is gonna care tf
41,I take no part in this net of interns
42,This fits so well
43,its england who supports its royal family with stolen wealth from its colonies why would any one respect them
44,"No one is safe from internet, NO ONE !"
45,What is she gonna do bout it
46,Press [F] to pay respects
47,![gif](giphy|AzFPW4gpKw2C4)
48,![gif](giphy|hStvd5LiWCFzYNyxR4|downsized)
49,Technoblade wanted people to meme him
50,"bro cancer research actually breaks my fuckin heart. when my anatomy teacher was still in college, they had this guy come in to talk about cancer and shit. this guy whips out what is essentially just the cure to fucking cancer, and he cant commercialize it and like get the hospitals to supply this shit because, and i fucking quote, ‚Äúthey make more money off of chemo‚Äù

i want to beat the living shit out of the fucking bastards that shoot down effective cancer treatment just so they can milk a family into dust."
51,It‚Äôs just never really been reddit‚Äôs strong suit tbh
52,Have you seen tumblr ? Those fuckers have no sense of humanity
53,You‚Äôre literally correct. Like what are they gonna do about it? Nothing.
54,"Stfu u piece of shit and all those memes about her death are so unfunny and disrespectful Fuck it someone so important for so many people and countries die and it's horrible and y'all dumbass redditors think ""Oh WeLl i'M gOnNa MaKe A mEmE aBoUt It LoL"" wtf"
55,rest in piss*
56,"This is so funny, just make one thing she achieved to be remembered, just stole the country‚Äôs money and did some evil shit"
57,The dead can't talk.
58,Still sore you were never able to beat a country with a smaller military?
59,"And in 1845-52, 1916 and 1922,, and 800 years.. from Ireland"
60,I believe this is what we call a a sentence fragment and run-on sentence in one‚Ä¶
61,Silence is approval of the wicked
62,Can you explain to me why you are so angry with the royal family and the queen?
63,"I agree, those motherfuckers trying to make a profit off of people sufferng is terrible. a lot of people don‚Äôt even get tested for health problems before it‚Äôs almost too late, just because a simple test costs so much. healthcare should be a basic human right, not a luxury."
64,Sounds like a tinfoil theory
65,"that is the biggest bullshit i heard, no one has cure for cancer, if the claim he does, he is fucking lying.

this conspiracy makes no sense, like it's plausible if pharmaceutical don't want to invest for currle. but if someone has the cure already? he will easily get private and public funding and be a billionaire"
66,It's just never really been mankind's strong suit tbh
67,Tumblr is full of terminally online morons. I wouldn't put the lack of humanity past them.
68,There‚Äôs also quite a few people like that on reddit as well
69,Tumblr still exists?
70,Most sane British person
71,"Bruh I've never heard of any british people who genuinely cared about the Queen... the Royal family is a joke, it's an outdated formality."
72,"Do not worry mate, I make memes about unknown people dying aswell."
73,Thanks for making the jokes even funnier.
74,Fuck the Queen
75,I KNOW! LIKE ITS SO RUDE! How would all these people feel if someone made fun of their death üíÄ
76,First day on the internet?
77,"Queen Elizabeth was a racist, she funded a concentration camp in Kenya, she defended her Pedophile son Prince Andrew, and she was a monarch. And lots of other terrible shit to name. So before you go and say Rest In Piece to someone like her. Please do your research."
78,Well I can and if you do bad shit when you‚Äôre alive then don‚Äôt expect me to respect you when you die
79,Start [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) and just start clicking around
80,"Even more than that there are organizations such as St. Jude whose purpose is just to help people, they are funded by peoples donations, because they don‚Äôt charge the families they help, and have operating costs of $2 billion according to https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/unique-operating-model.html
If such a cure existed and was safe and effective, they would be using it ASAP, because even if you don‚Äôt believe their goal is just to help families, that cure would save them huge amounts of money, each patient‚Äôs treatment costs an average of $425,000.  That doesn‚Äôt include the other things they pay for including food, housing, and travel, costs that would be almost entirely eliminated if they could quickly cure their cancer, rather than move them to their hospitals so they can receive regular treatment, where they are responsible for giving the child housing and food, and will be, for up to three years"
81,Pretty much
82,"Yeah, it's quite bland now. I keep it around for Harry Potter fanfic and some nice photos but haven't looked into it for a couple of years"
83,I'm British and I'm laughing at the memes.
84,Didn't she defend her son in court for pedophilia or something
85,"Idk bro, she's kind of old... Oh and uhh, she's dead."
86,Id be glad if people joked abouty death instead of moping around
87,"Likely nothing, considering they'd be dead"
88,I'll tell ya how I'd feel. I wouldn't feel at all I'd be dead. They can do whatever they want
89,You say the monarch part like that in it of itself is a bad thing.
90,"Yeah but she also donated thousands, if not millions to charity and plus dude she just died show some respect"
91,Literally an edgy 13 year old
92,"Ah i understand, but times have changed."
93,gotta be fast before rigor mortis kicks in
94,"True, but you still get to say,
‚ÄúI fucked the Queen ‚Äú"
95,Still living in the blood money of colonization counts as a bad thing. Being a part of that family makes her scum
96,It is
97,Donated millions from money that she stole
98,"Millions died in bengal famines due to this family, she didnt do even 1/10000000th of the due for her family"
99,"It was the same queen, actually, and she awarded the soldiers who shot protesters on Bloody Sunday. Ireland is still separated and under British rule. The times have not changed that much at all."
100,üíÄ
