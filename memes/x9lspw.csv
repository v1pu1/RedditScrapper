49,"well, i mean there are many neurological issues that have no cure


like dementia, or rabies. Cancer too once it reaches past a certain point. 


You could theoretically replace every organ in the body with a machine except for the liver and nervous system. Though they would never be able to reach the same capacity as your normal organs could"
50,Recycling helps the environment!
51,Everybody does gtfo
52,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/x98g2v/shes\_back/](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/x98g2v/shes_back/)

She clutched it"
53,upvoted because i completely agree
54,"Dementia doesnâ€™t always kill you, sometimes it just makes living worse than death"
55,[Wikipedia says hi.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenarian)
56,Hmm. The challenge is prolonging consciousness.
57,Heard the opponent was a newborn it was a close fight.
58,"eventually you do forget to breathe then die, or something similar, loss of motor functions"
59,Unfortunately true
60,read what i've said again - but ill also edit it for more clarity
61,"I mean theoretically it is possible?


Dialysis machines, ECMO machines, IV drips with all the nutrients you need


and technically thats all you need to live. Bone marrow would be needed for red blood cell production and you'd have to be in an absolutely sterile room but technically its possible"
62,that's horrible
63,"Do you forget to breathe, or do you forget *how* to breathe?"
64,"Yeah, I was just thinking about how to restart consciousness or maintain it during a transfer phase from one body to another. Could be that it's designed in such a way that data transfer is impossible and so is disconnecting the brain without losing yourself. I don't know

Trouble is we still don't know. If two people are born and theoretically live exactly the same life as each other, the same parents and house, same food and same words used around them, like a simulated repeat, just how different could the person turn out? Completely different? That would imply complexity on such a scale... But then if they were mostly the same personality type, at least that proves consciousness isn't special and neither is being alive and aware of it, since anyone can be just like you, thinking like you and behaving like you at any point, just like a rock floating through space, another part of the environment."
65,your brain will not automatically breathe anymore and you usually die in your sleep
66,"Man, forgetting to breathe must suck. Probably the best for these folks, though."
