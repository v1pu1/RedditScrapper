0,"I like IPhone, not enough to buy it every year though, more like every 7, when my phone actually stops being useful."
1,theres 14? the 11 still feels brand new
2,"I’m still rocking an iPhone 7, this should be a worthy upgrade no?"
3,they just removed the physical sim tray on the vanilla iPhone 13 and called it a day basically
4,"tbf do you want a 1000 dollar phone being outdated in a year? i like apple, nothings wrong in getting an iphone 11 and not feeling the need to upgrade to an iphone 14."
5,"Ok jokes aside, I have an iPhone xs max that already got its display replaced once. Would the iPhone 14 be worth it?"
6,"""Works better than most pro cameras""

DOUBT 100"
7,"It’s just the 13.5, complete joke of a phone. 

Coming from an iPhone user, I’ll be sticking with my 11."
8,Sticking with my 11. No issues and don’t care for a new phone right now
9,"At some point after 7 or 8, I just started thinking they're fucking with people and laughing their asses off."
10,"i love iphones. i buy a new one every 4 years, and i am happy. let people live."
11,"Wait, there’s a 13?"
12,Wait until you guys start looking into cars and their “new model” every year…
13,I trade in my phones whenever there is a great deal. I traded my broken iPhone X for my 13pro for next to nothing and it came with a set of free AirPods. I’ll trade my 13 in a few years when there is a deal that makes sense.
14,r/memes when they see apple making a new phone (they can call it useless for free karma which was never fine before)
15,"i DoNt cAre!!

\*made a post about it\*"
16,"I like Apple iPhones. But I only upgrade every 3 years or so, to the model that came out the year prior to the newest one.

People who upgrade every year are either wealthy or stupid."
17,OMG omg apple bad give me karma now
18,"iPhone are really good phones. They have that whole enclosed ecosystem thing going on, but I’ve received a couple free iPads from work over the years and once you have multiple apple devices, the smoothness of transitioning between devices is really nice. A friend got me a few of the original iPhones through his work, so I’ve been on iPhones since they came out. I used to jailbreak my iPhones to do all sorts of stuff, but now I prefer the security of a regular iOS at the cost of a bit of software inflexibility. 

With that said, prices are ludicrous and there is no reason whatsoever to constantly upgrade. I tend to buy 3-year old iPhones for much cheaper, and ideally use them for more years than that. I currently us an XS. 

I actually have a pile of 8 or so old iPhones of various generations, with I think 3 of the original 4gb ones. Those ones I think still work, most of the newer ones died from water damage or LCD went out and it was old enough to just replace."
19,You care enough to make a post about it
20,Genuine question: Isn’t the iPhone 14 exactly like the iPhone 13 Pro with one camera less but a little bit more expensive?
21,"People say shit like “pff it’s almost like the last one!!!”, like normal people buy a new phone every year…"
22,They made some major improvements like satellite connectivity better cameras and a pill cutout. It may not be the best phone for everyone but for some people it’s a major upgrade.
23,"Idk I like apple, nothing wrong with that is there?"
24,Okay don’t buy it?
25,Hating the brand of phone you don’t have is extremely 2012
26,"So is this whole sub just ""iPhone bad"" every time a new one comes out?"
27,"Idk, it looks pretty good to my broke SE using ass"
28,"Y’all complaining about iPhone is releasing every year, what about the other device such as LG, Samsung, etc? In the first place, have you really tried an iPhone before?"
29,Why is there a *minigun barrel* on the back of the phone?
30,Idk why people act like the average consumer buys every iPhone instead of buying the 1st or second newest whenever their phone needs to be replaced
31,"every smartphone release is like this, updates are super incremental and there aren't major differences for 3-4 years. samsung, apple, everyone"
32,[deleted]
33,Oh fuck here comes another wave of must hate thing because other people like thing
34,The satellite connectivity is pretty wild I must say.
35,"If you were to buy a 2022 Ford Focus, would you immediately turn around and buy a 2023 Ford Focus when it came out and then complain that they only made small iterative changes? This is how I view buying phones. Buy one and run it till it’s dead and see what generational changes have been added a few years down the road (or longer)"
36,I don’t get why we see so much hate for apple but not other companies. Just buy whatever phone you want lol.
37,"Lol, classic reddit hive-mentality of hating anything that is popular. It's a small upgrade but it is stills a great phone. Apple is a victim of their own success, from now on they can only improve the speed, battery and camera. I think that the decision to upgrade depends on what's current generation your at."
38,"If apple loves cameras so much, why don't they just sell 2,000$ cameras that need 5g to work for 800$ a month lol"
39,Oh look its another Apple bashing meme. They are getting really original. Let people mind their own business.
40,The karma farming and the hive mentality is strong in this one

42,Redditors after shitting on the new iPhone(no one ever did that before)(haha get rekt apple fanboys):
43,I mean me being with an 8+ it seems pretty good to me
44,£300 2020SE go brrrrrrrrr
45,Say phone capabilities are pretty lit though. I do agree upgrading every year is dumb asf but if u buy a new one every like 5 or 6 it’s not too bad
46,The fact that they didn’t add  usbc is unforgivable and super anti consumer and goes against all their damn environmentally friendly bullshit.
47,People who make posts like these have iPhones already. Closet apples trying to appeal to their femboywaifus on android playing cool games and modding all night
48,*OP angrily makes this on a Samsung for no apparent reason*
49,OP discovers that new phones are basically the same with every year iterration
50,Not a iphone guy but I like the new satellite SOS feature. Might be helpful for a lot of people.
51,I mean I haven’t watched the trailer but how is it stupid. It’s been copy and paste for like the last 3 years
52,"I got the SE this year after using a shitty 6S that would have a battery life shorter than my attention span.

Serving me quite well so far. Lack of aux is fucking with me tho"
53,"It’s a phone, it functions like any other phone, there’re phones that go for lower prices that operate the same function. Why would anyone even bother buying this lmao"
54,"I don't get it seriously, buying all these smartphones the newest the better
I'm still using my realme shitty one phone for 230$ it's 3,5 year already it works fine and is enough for me 
MEANWHILE my friend bought newest Samsung and the only advantage of this 2k$ phone over mine is that it opens explorer 0.2 sec faster
Seriously 
What's the point 
Better buy weed or Whiskey
Or both"
55,I’m using a seven and it’s barely has a battery life so i need a new one
56,"Goodbye,kidney!"
57,Im more excited for Android 13 tbh.. its free so why not?
58,"iPhone 14 pro and pro max are in no way ‘worthless’ they get the fancy 120hz screens, 48mp cameras and all the fancy stuff
It’s the base 14 and 14 max that suck because they are basically the same thing using the old chipset and everything just with some minor camera upgrades. 14 max is just a dumb idea. If people want to pay more for a bigger phone, it’s gonna cost barely anything to get a pro. Also android, if someone wants a large phone, litterally any android in midrange to flagship markets will work and perform how people need it too if they don’t want the pro"
59,GUYS!!!!! THEY RELEASED THE SAME THING AGAIN FOR THE THOUSANDTH YEAR IN A ROW!!!!! I’M GONNA BUY THE EXACT SAME THING I HAVE RIGHT NOW!!!!!
60,"I will comment that for anyone that owns a 13, if you trade it in for the 14 you pay considerably less to upgrade it. Even the 12 gives you a decent discount. Now if you are going from a 13 to 14 pro that may not be the case. But anyone upgrading every year really isn’t paying that 1000$ every year."
61,"I've been an android user for the last 10+ years, and it sucks that i literally ruin every group text i join + every video i get looks like shit .  99% of my family and friends have iphones, and i think i might be jumping ship.  Im currently using a note 10+, so i'm at least semi sure that the iphone 14 will be an upgrade for me."
62,"In every century, people have bought overpriced things to fake being high class. It means nothing. It's just human nature. Fight the chimp inside if you can though."
63,"""Less than worthless my boy!"""
64,IPhone 19: 190 cameras
65,"![gif](giphy|MFTkGFJb32hOL3ZmuB|downsized)

Apple after releasing the same model with tweeked features and selling it to dummies who will buy anything:"
66,went on twitter a couple of hours ago and it recomended a vid by i justine going nuts over the new color and i said after 2 seconds ahh a new color... how revolutionary and closed twitter
67,Phones nowadays are just plain bricks with a screen. You have to innovate to stand out and apple hasn't done that since the iPhone x.
68,What did the 14 add?
69,Still surprised that people actually throw a grand every year for the same thing like where does your previous phone even go. Its like the fifa games
70,I liked the dynamic notching idea otherwise it is the same phone
71,[deleted]
72,Apple is just a giant cashgrab of a company. Wow guys new camera!
73,Same shit different price
74,It has no headphone jack so you have to pay for Airpods
75,It’s less than worthless.
76,Yeah. I still have the 12 Pro. Felt no need to upgrade since then. Nothing new or exciting has come out in years.
77,"I’m convinced after the iPhone 7 Apple started slacking and about the time the iPhone 12 was made, Apple just full on stopped trying"
78,Die hard iPhone users are gonna down vote the shit out of this
79,"I've been pondering for a while now. We are already at Iphone 14 in less than 10 years we are at 20. Are they really gonna keep going past 20 or what? ""Here is the new and improved Iphone 27 with slightly better camera than the last!"" Sounds silly to me."
80,Same Phone 14
81,Thats why i prefer samsung
82,Does anyone have advice on what the best current phone is for high quality pics and video with a decent battery life?
83,"i just watched the trailer, the only reaction i have is: What the fuck is this peice of shit?"
84,Less than worthless my boy
85,"Once again, its the yearly same phone release that people are dumb enough to keep buying. The same people who buy Madden or NBA2K every year."
86,"I was impressed, I think it's because I've never bought something so expensive"
87,Wait there’s an iPhone 14 now? I feel like the iPhone 11 just dropped
88,bruh you’re not sensible you’re just jealous and can’t afford it so you try to bring down people that can get it by trying to act like you’re smarter
89,I usually defend iPhones but God these ones are bad
90,Are you guys so poor that you have to make yourselves feel good that you can’t afford it?
91,HuRr dUrR aPpLe bAd!1!1 GiVe kArMa nOw!
92,Cringe
93,Why are you crying? iPhones are some of the best phones out there and just because they release a new one every year doesn’t mean you need to buy it. and the great thing about iPhones is that they’re supported for years. I mean the current OS supports phones from 2015.
94,[deleted]
95,"Apple: announced anything 

People: oMg So UsElEsS

Samsung: does the same thing every year

People: my sweet baby Samsung"
96,"iJustine is gonna be praising the hell out of it too lmao. That’s how I have no credibility for her “tech reviews”

I’ll stick to my iPhone 12 thank you very much."
97,Get yo money up
98,13s
99,Im still using an iPhone 6S
100,"I went from the iPhone 5 to the 10 about 1-2 years ago, I’ll wait another few gens before I update."
