2,This meme was foretold.

In other words, he is the last pillar for the world's stability"
4,Shes going to respawn
5,Most foregone meme ever
6,...and in 3 days she will resurrect...
7,This meme has been sitting my head for the past 3 years. I knew someone was goanna make it. Now it’s here I feel a mix of joy and slight pain.
8,this meme was inevitable
9,"She will always be alive in the hearts of every true brit such as myself, I have already poured out a cup of tea on the floor for her as a libation and burned some fresh cream jam scones as an offering, as well as smashing a bottle of gin on the ground. I shall also be joining the queue to pay respects to her body in Westminster Hall, where it will be kept before her funeral, in what will be the longest, most orderly and well respected queue that has ever existed. Finally, on the day of the Royal funeral, I'll get really drunk and fall asleep in a ditch with only my underpants on."
10,We've reached the end of time
11,Redditors waiting for the queen to die so they can Photoshop it with the impossible template
12,Obviously she’s pretending to be dead so that she can come back years later
13,RIP the queen and all the “older than x” memes
14,Damn the prediction memes were right
15,"Fr, some people are fucking messed up. Making those disrespectful memes about the Queen. I can’t believe people have the audacity to do that. She wasn’t even a bad Queen, she was a good human"
16,Ight time to dig tea outta boston.
17,God dam it. First techno now the queen. 2022 sucks.

24,Sadly it was … inevitable.
25,"Those immortal meme are no longer relevant

*Sad*"
26,*possible

28,I Bet Elizabeth is hiding in a bunker somewhere and she wont get out before there is no one who remembers her so she Can pretend to not be immortal again
29,No ragrets
30,Motherfucker she is not dead
31,"God save our gracious Queen, 
Long live our noble Queen, 
God save the Queen! 
Send her victorious, 
Happy and glorious, 
Long to reign over us, 
God save the Queen!

O Lord our God arise,
Scatter our enemies,
And make them fall!
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all!

Not in this land alone, 
But be God’s mercies known, 
From shore to shore! 
Lord make the nations see, 
That men should brothers be, 
And form one family, 
The wide world o’er.

From every latent foe,
From the assassins blow,
God save the Queen!
O’er her thine arm extend,
For Britain’s sake defend,
Our mother, prince, and friend,
God save the Queen!

Thy choicest gifts in store, 
On her be pleased to pour, 
Long may she reign! 
May she defend our laws, 
And ever give us cause, 
To sing with heart and voice, 
God save the Queen!"
32,"And here i thought i wasnt gonna see ever again memes about here. I dont mean to disrespect the queen, but those memes became annoying"
33,me and my friends predicted a thousand memes like these would be named today and we were right lmfaooo one even said this exact meme with the exact thanos template. reddit is getting predictable
34,"ctrl+h 

*phewww.. how was your work today john ?*"
35,"Me, who figured out about it before the “was” change happened:

I am speed"
36,"As now the queen is in heaven...who will save god.
The immortal one will rule the planet now"
37,God gave up
38,It was indeed
39,You are like 2 years to early
40,How old is he?
41,"Agreed, I personally think that she is one of the best leaders to ever live, she was a true legend both in and outside of the real world. She was quite a sweet Lady and the Paddington Bear short will still be my favourite short animation for years to come. It feels unusual as she was a icon of our country, our culture, our honor as Brits, she has been alive all my life yet now she is gone. God may no longer be able to save the queen, but he can keep sure she makes it to Heaven safe. My sister was telling me about the one time we met her, she waved at us all with a bright smile, she was in her car and all, but she loved her country as we lived her. I hope the next in line can honor the country as much as she did."
42,"She didn't even give a single fuck about her own people, let alone countries who were once colonized. You say you are a brit then don't you know how much of your tax money her family ate up? What about getting her son out because he was a pedo? You fucking royalist. Idk about you being a true brit but you're definitely a true bastard. People like you should have died by her reign not my innocent ancestors. Go get drunk in a ditch and don't wake up."
43,How is this disrespectful? It's stating she died and how that should be impossible cause she is immortal
44,She was a bad queen and a worst human.
45,Ironically I posted this an hour ago on here
46,"I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/memes.

It might be OC, it might not. Things such as JPEG artifacts and cropping may impact the results.

47,Calm down Charles. Mommy is gone
48,CNN as of 1 day ago said she died
49,[removed]
50,"""Impossible"""
51,Doubt she's in heaven
52,"87 years, but he looks like he's on his late 40s"
53,"Agreed, the amount of royalist bootlicking I’m seeing is astounding. They’re nothing but archaic colonialists, and to “grieve” for someone who was a leader of a criminal empire and doesn’t give a single fuck about you is pathetic. I for one, am glad she died."
54,My guy got offended by someone grieving
55,agreed
56,Oh shit...
57,I remember seeing the meme you speak of
