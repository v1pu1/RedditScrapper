Hey /u/ChoppyWAL99, thanks for contributing to /r/memes. Unfortunately, your post was removed as it violates our rules:

Rule 7 - No meta-Reddit references, such as:

* Please do not mention upvotes/downvotes/cake days/karma/awards/followers/coins/etc. in your post in any form.**

  * No ""Upvote in..."" or ""Upvote if..."" type titles or memes.

  * **No memes about votes, likes etc.**

  * This includes (but is not limited to) karma-adjacent words/phrases like ""front page"", ""hot"", or ""sort by new"".

Begging for karma in the comments may earn you a lengthy (perhaps infinite) ban.
