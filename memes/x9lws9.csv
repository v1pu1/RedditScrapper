1,"She was a monarch who lived a fancy ass life paid for by the countries and people britain invaded and her own people.

she didn't have to work a day in her life and does not deserve adoration.

Edit: consider this the british people pay for there monarchy but have no problem, is it because of propaganda?"

5,Are you smoking something she did many great thing in her life accomplished stuff unlike your useless and pathetic life
6,You should probably learn about constitutional monarchies and the Westminster System before you type anymore.
7,">britain invaded

Lol

>she didn't have to work a day in her life

So you just said out loud that you don't know shit

>she didn't have to work a day in her life

Then who does?"
8,"Can you actually name one that wasn't her glory hoarding that was actually HER accomplishment and not someone else's

Just consider the fact that you pay for the monarchy and the monarchy will do and tell you whatever it takes to keep it that way.
Not only do you serve the monarchy but you take to the internet to defend the monarchy in a passionate and somewhat childish way."
9,I think you should read my comment and replies again before you type anymore.
10,"You are forced to pay for the royal families lives and you do so proudly.

Don't you see the problem?

And pretending to work isn't working
That's like saying zelenski is a soldier cause he posed for some photos, she hasn't worked, she ruled and posed.
 when the germans were at Britain's door she did what everyone was doing, she did her part.
get real a monarch is not a good thing."
11,">Don't you see the problem?

That's how taxes work. Very often you pay for the things you don't need or need very rarely

>And pretending to work isn't working

Maintaing diplomatic relations and going abroad to have talks with other politicians is a job"
12,">That's how taxes work. Very often you pay for the things you don't need or need very rarely

And that's the process of advancing as a civilization, we call out the problems and fix them.
We don't try and say ""oh but there are problems everywhere"" as some lame half baked excuse

>Maintaing diplomatic relations and going abroad to have talks with other politicians is a job

She hasn't, britain has had elected officials doing that for a longer time and you don't need a monarch to Do that."
13,"You know that the money that currently goes for royals would be spend differently making no changes amongst the common people?

>She hasn't

Literally took me 2 second to google it, and she has done it"
14,"As I said passing for pictures isn't doing anything even if there are foreign world leaders in that photo and as I said a monarch isn't necessary for anything even diplomatic relationships

But I'm going to bed now you clearly don't want to listen but it is a fact that you pay for your monarchy (in more ways than one)"
