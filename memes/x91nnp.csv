1,"Just cook it yourself, you can make one."
2,Have you tried the grocery store?
3,***HAMBURGER CHEEZBURGER BIG MAC WHOPPER***
4,"Looking at the comments and I gotta say the thing is, any healthy food in the US is gonna be way more expensive than the cheap corn syrup filled crap. So itâ€™s about being able to eat healthily while also not going broke just trying to get decent vegetables.

Or buying any prepackaged or processed food not made with corn syrup, thatâ€™s also very hard.

Itâ€™s expensive as fuck here to eat healthily here."
5,"Fast food in any country is unhealthy. Try a restaurant and order something healthy. Or check out your local grocery store and, you know, cook."
6,"I've got 2 refrigerators and 2 freezers full of healthy stuff, stop on by."
7,"I mean you really have to try to NOT find healthy foods in the US.  There is PLENTY of unhealthy garbage, but there is also plenty of healthy food available without having to look very hard for it."
8,"It ain't in the snack cake isle, my dude."
9,Ya gotta cook it well.
10,Go look at your local grocery store.
11,Get a chicken and boil it till itâ€™s gray and sneeze on it for seasoning and itâ€™ll be like your back home

14,Thatâ€™s how I feel. Currently living off bananas and candy
15,Well the reason you canâ€™t find any is because youâ€™re looking under the couch cushions idiot
16,Isn't nut milk healthy
17,"Ohh that's easy. We have the second amendment, as easy as going outside and blasting the all organic free range bugger."
18,Wow yall are pressed lmfaooo
19,"Hahahaha, I havenâ€™t actually been to us but Iâ€™ve watched some Americans making reels on insta about their cooking and Iâ€™ve always thought this looks quite unhealthy and one more odd thing Iâ€™ve noticed is that they mostly use the same ingredients over and over again. Like there will be some meat, bread and cheese. Donâ€™t you guys get bored from it?"
20,A cigarette is literally the healthiest thing you can put in your mouth in the states.....
21,NYC has plenty of options for healthy food. Not sure where OP visited.
22,Red Robin
23,Itâ€™s corn.  We only have corn.
24,Johhny harris did a video called why Americans eat desert for breakfast
25,You are not from the U.S are you. And no i don't count california or new york.
26,Panera bread
27,"Did you even try? Any grocery store. Any sandwich chain or salad chain or make your own whatever chain (Roti, chipotle, etc all have salad bowl options)â€¦"
28,U.S. people mad! :(
29,"You guys must be a special kind of special. Healthy food is EVERYWHERE and much cheaper than the junk. Kinda like your mom. 

(Joke borrowed from my 9YO)"
30,"Oh, there are healthy things to eat here, they're just unaffordable for most of the population. It's easy to say, ""just stop buying junk food"", but when you can stretch your dollar further by buying it, there just isn't as much incentive to avoid it."
31,Carrot
32,Itâ€™s called paying 300 dollars for a week of food. Luckily Iâ€™m one of the few in America who can afford to not be obese.
33,This is true unless you buy good foods lol most mfs don't
34,"I think OP is talking about restaurants. In Europe you have a lot more heathy options to eat in restaurants. 

You dont have to cook when you are on vacations or on business trip. Fresh and healthy food is easy to get almost anywhere. 

Also even restaurants with healthy food taste worse in US."
35,Ainâ€™t nobody got time for that
36,"But you see, even the ingredients have unnecessary preservatives and sugar in them. How do you cook healthy when even the ingredients arenâ€™t healthy? Genuine question"
37,"Aight, but how do you do that in a hotel room"
38,"I have spend so much time looking for a normal bread, that is not soft like a sponge and has tons of sugar added to it"
39,"Idk. Non-fast-food Mexican restaurants have cheap healthy options around here. Some of the Korean spots are pretty cheap too. What country are we even comparing the US to here? Sure healthy food can cost a little more here, but it's still cheaper than healthy food in plenty of other places, our junk food is just so cheap it makes the regular food seem expensive"
40,"Right, right, restaurants. Let's just take the bus down town... Where's the busses? Where's the downtown?"
41,"What's your address? Mine is 6353 Juan Tabo Blvd NE, Apt 6, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87111."
42,What kinda nuts got nipples that can be milked?
43,"Depends on where you live and how you were raised. I live in the South which is super unhealthy, but I eat whole grains and vegetables with lean meat every day, so it all just depends. 

Also remember in the US, a single state can be the size of some European countries so everything including food is super spread out."
44,"Well, meat bread and cheese are sorta staple foods. You find that sorta thing in every country."
45,He def went to Detroit.
46,"Im not from the us, but in the US at the moment. 
And i know that there is lots of healthy food. Its just a joke"
47,"I have, and i kow that there are healhy options. Its just a joke because there is a lot of unhealthy food"
48,True
49,dude thinks he's special ðŸ˜‚
50,Oh that song. Nostalgia hit me like a truck
51,"To be honest farmers markets if your lucky enough to have one in driving distance mind you this is America an hours drive is considered reasonable. You won't get milk or meat but eggs and honey are often sold.

Edit: side note farmers markets mostly happen on weekends and not evey week either."
52,"I acknowledge that food deserts are a huge problem, I vacation in one every year, but you need you go completely raw. Yes, meats are usually brined, but that's also why proteins shrink when you cook them, it's the residual brine and water being cooked out. There's always an option if you look far enough back at how something is made, save the bones from your meat and freeze them to make a bomb af broth; a little butter and water in a pan after you sear the protein, stir the bits in with a pinch of flour and you have an amazing sauce without anything unnecessary. If we want to split hairs, even eating is technically unhealthy since it aids cellular reproduction, which increases the chance of cancer. Use a sterilite bin to make yourself a greenhouse herb garden, it's almost impossible to kill basil a second time. If you talk to the security at a Target location, they usually know different free things in the area because of their outreach programs, like community gardens."
53,.....you...go grocery shopping like an adult
54,"Cook using a microwave, or my favorite use the clothing iron and a pan. College students become creative"
55,"Maybe chicken, salmon, broccoli, asparagus, carrots, anything in the produce section

Brown rice, whole grain pasta, couscous, quinoa?

If you need healthy recipes or meal prep ideas, I gotchu fam. I lost 40 lbs and Iâ€™m a fitness coach/nutritionist now."
56,"Our rural areas have less public transport, yes. 

But what does ""where's downtown"" mean? As if we don't have metropolitan areas?"
57,Different type of cooking tho.
58,Any nut u have in mind
59,I know its a joke. It is just not a very creative one.
60,Bruh Iâ€™m saying that the obesity rate in the us comes from poverty not stupidity and piggishness.
61,Mmm milk me harder daddy.
62,Even ur gf don't swallow that milk
