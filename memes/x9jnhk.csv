0,Sure we can help unload the trucks...unload them straight into our own vehicles and drive away.
1,"Hot take (maybe, Redditors are weird): I love self checkout. I’ve stopped going to stores without them."
2,Fucking self checkouts man
3,"Thank you for supporting the Denver Broncos… go ahead and get that box of cookies, because you deserve it and we need to get a new RB."
4,Ha i’ve been telling that to other shoppers at Walmart for three years now. The next time you were there ask the worker if you bought the right amount of toilet paper for the amount of food you bought. If they’re professionals they should have answers to these questions.
5,I believe they would do this. People love self checkout. Made it easy for Walmart not to pay you to work there.
6,I love people who complain about self checkout… I get in and out of the store 10x faster then I use to because some idiot is always carrying on with the cashier and she’s going extra slow because she’s distracted talking with her hands.
7,…and still get harassed to show my receipt to the guy by the door who watched me scan everything.
8,"If you're so concerned about self checkouts, im sure there's applications to be a cashier!! It's also (on average) the lowest paying position in store!"
9,It's a love hate.  But they still need to man enough lanes so you don't have huge lines.
10,"Interestingly enough, though,  I now go to the full service checkouts because the lines are shorter. Much shorter."
11,"Nope. I rarely shop at the place, why would I want to WORK there... If I could work. 

True, I did apply at one 20 years ago, but they didn't like my terms even when I was health $30/hour with a 15 minute break every hour on the hour. Company car, use of company jet for my monthly 1 week vacation, and the company pays not only for my health insurance, but also any co-pays not covered. They said they couldn't do that because they were in the business to make money. I replied I work to make money. Those terms would be the only way I could do so."
12,I'd be shocked if you found a retail company that followed any part of those terms. It's cute you try to make this smart ass comment however let's be a little more realistic when asking for things from places that pay less than what is needed for all one does. Team leads (customer service managers) of cashiers make the least amount compared to any other manager in store. I know some who have normal AB associates who make the same or close to what they do.
13,"And the Waltons are all billionaires, so what?

THEY can afford my terms but the cheapskates only want to keep it for themsleves."
14,"So your issue is with the Waltons? Most of which aren't with the company in anyway besides last name?

Which by the way isn't the people who are in the store. Also the fuck did the Waltons do to you? Sam Walton started a (obviously) pretty good company. Sorry you don't have the same luck."
15,"1: read up on the history of Walmart. Sam took advantage of a lot of women workers back when. He hated the idea of paying a livable wage.

2: Secondly, this is a humor subreddit. I'm sorry that you are too stupid to realize this. Lighten up, for christ's sake."
16,">So your issue is with the Waltons? Most of which aren't with the company in anyway besides last name?

They still own almost 50% of the company, shut the fuck up, you don't know what you are talking about."
17,"1. I absolutely have, working at walmart will have you reading up on it. Also when I started most of your training starts with learning how Sam started his company. Sam also wasn't the worst business man to date, there's far worse. 

2.Humor is supposed to be funny. The only people who find this funny are the ones who either end up being Karens at the store or they are the ones who laugh after stealing. I have an idea on who you are."
18,"Did they stress the below minimum wage pay that he paid out. Yeah, [he played the system](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wage-and-means/) I doubt it. Sorry you've been suckered by the corporation. They LOVE employees that are too stupid to realize their actual worth. Why do you think so many Walmart employees have to rely on government assistance. 

As for humor, humor is ALWAYS subjective. Oh, your comments have me rolling on the floor, laughing my ass off. Whoo---HA. You're a real comedienne."
19,"I don't know of any who live off of government assistance unless they are actually disabled and can't work. Also let's all be fair to walmsrt employees. 

There aren't any fucking cashiers because they all left after everyone told them to get better jobs. Which leaves you to do it yourself."
