0,Just do half the surgery
1,Yes! Math!
2,"Success rate of 1 surgery: 50%
Success rate of 2 surgeries: 25%
Success rate of 0.5 surgery: 100%

Dude, just do half the surgery and leave it… the numbers don’t lie!"
3,What I don't understand is that they're both dressed as genius bar people. Why does it look like one is not qualified for the job?
4,"İsnt it going to be 75% ?

Success : 1

Failure : 0

1 + 0  = 1

0 + 1 =  1

1 + 1 = 1

0 + 0 = 0"
5,Did I stutter
6,Do it half a time then?
7,"hold on, it’s still 50% success rate twice"
8,I am banana
9,Sir now you have a 100% chance of both failure and success
10,"If success means it goes well (and you don't care when it goes bad) twice is better.

The possibilities are SS, SF, FS, FF

3/4 probability you get a success if they do it twice."
11,This is the way
12,Yes! Meth!
13,Wouldn’t half a surgery be 71%~ success rate?
14,I think the implication is that an unsuccessful surgery is either death or some other complications but yeah it’s a stupid meme
15,Yeah that is correct. This meme is stupid...
16,"Wha?

If 1 of the operation is 0, you're already dead. Only 1+1 is success."
17,Schrödinger’s Surgery
18,Welp we are friends now. Deal with it!
19,“Jesse we need to do surgery”
20,"I know

I just make it see as the what memes says"
