0,I've seen more memes about Queen's death at this point more than actual news about her departure üíÄ
1,God save the king I guess?
2,"BREAKING NEWS, THE QUEEN OF AUSTRALIA DIED AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND"
3,"Ok but will the national anthem change?
Cuz god save the Queen clearly didn't help"
4,"Can confirm. I'm heartbroken. I feel anguish beyond all compare. My mind, soul and body are nothing but empty shells, I am but an echo of my former self. My life and all its purpose, meaning and joy have been robbed, and I fear my will to live shall never return. Words are but squiggles that will never have the power to portray how truly melancholy I am. When I heard the news, it's as if all the colour was looted from my world. All passion and happiness melted before my very eyes. Since her majesty's death, I only see black and white, pain and misery, hopelessness and suffering. 

Oh, my queen. My heart and the heart of the nation longs for you. We grieve for you. You were our rock, our foundation. I deeply fear for the outcome of our planet now that you are not here to guide us with your goddess-like wisdom. The nation is inconsolable, it weeps for our queen.

You think that's how we feel?  (‚Å†‚âß‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚â¶‚Å†)"
5,"Im sorry for ya loss brits, but the memes about her returning from the gulag are hilarious"

10,My condolences to her family and all of the united kingdom.
11,If you want to lose all faith in humanity than go look at tumblr. Those freaks are jubilant right now.

22,Irish people having the most biggest celebrations ever:
23,I'm sure the Queen has been resurrected to Heaven and cane back but doesn't want to be modest and is keeping her return to her family
24,"I'm a Brit, the Royals are living large off of our taxes, I couldn't care less about which Royal ""Reins"" they should all be shown the guillotine, especially Peado Andrew."
25,I don't particularly care. In fact I'm only browsing this sub to check if anyone has made one of those shitty posts where Harambe and various dead celebrities are welcoming the queen at the gates of heaven
26,"We care less than the rest of the world, everybody I know is celebrating"
27,"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think many of us care too much, that or we are too drunk to give a shit"
28,Nah the Reddit memes are shit the TikTok ones and Snapchat ones are the good ones
29,"Damn them to hell who laugh in the face of Death. A mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, Queen beloved by a nation. She wasn't an evil person. She was kind, sweet and wonderful. Yet you laugh. Most of you probably never saw her, never knew her. And now she is moched and scorned, betrayed by those she served her life for. She did more to England, Scotland and Wales than you will probably ever do. Laugh not her death and remember her legacy. Would you like to be called the same you call her, beyond your grave no less?"
