Especially if you're male. We've got a ticking time bomb located up our anuses called a prostate. If you don't die anyway, that thing will go cancerous. We've also got two self-destruct buttons located between our legs."
88,"It's something I've always wanted to ask but do you folk ever change the voices in your heads based off of what nationality it's set in or alluded to? For instance, when I read fantasy most of the time I read it with some sort of an English accent over my own hybrid southern US plain US accent. I only use my voice if the character is my age and gender."

99,"Yeah, but most of the time something else will get you before prostate cancer"
100,"Yes, but if it‚Äôs a mid west American accent it sounds like a Canadian mixed with a Norwegian accent, somehow."
