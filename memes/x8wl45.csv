1,Tbh it’s both shit.
2,Also apple Lets remove the sim tray for North American devices
3,"Fanboy things. It's also nothing new, in Android we call that ""notification bar""

Also, they removed a sim card tray lol. Enjoy your eSim fanboys."
4,"tbh, it's aight"
5,Apple has stopped trying.
6,"well, apple added a notch on computers and they sold well, I am not surprised that they are still continuing at targeting overpriced trash to stupid people."
7,That was my exact thoughts XD.
8,The difference is which Company made it
9,[deleted]
10,"It's the people who buy these that are damaged, in the head"
11,Whats a better way to do it?
12,So... Do you lot not have sim cards anymore?

15,"""On 20 May, the State Council declared martial law. It mobilized as many as ~300,000 troops to Beijing.[14] The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of 4 June, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process.""

16,The Not is literally never a problem. The only people I hear complaining about is are the people that have not used if for a period of time.
17,"Nope , people hated the notch on iPhones too. People loved the way that the Galaxy S8 lineup looked , they were well designed phones. Now the modern Galaxys look weird and feel uncomfortable to hold in one hand (with the exception of the Z flip). Phone companies nowadays are trying to solve problems that don’t exist, consumer demand has become irrelevant to big mobile phone brands."
18,"My guy I love Linux, but a smartphone and a computer/laptop are completely different form factors."
19,Under the screen when the technology gets optimized.
20,You're expected to have e-sim and pay ridiculous amounts of international roaming abroad if the local sim carrier doesn't have e-sim options.
21,I don't live in China wtf
22,"No, the only people who complain are the ones who are also piss poor."
23,"Look, I own a MacBook and I HATE IT. The OS is terrible and I installed something good on it, thats why it's called LinuxBook Pro now. Also, the Specs are pretty much like my old upgraed 2006 PC."
24,What's a better way to do it right now?
25,It's a fun fact
26,"Why do you buy a product when you don't like the OS? And what does this have to do with the notch? 

I would never go back to Windows after using MacOS, the experience is 100x better for my workflows. 

I have Linux on my Desktop PC where I do programming and stuff, but for a recreational device, and programming in the cloud, MacOS works perfectly for me and I would never go with all the shortcomings Linux comes with. Especially considering the eco-system advantages iOS/macOS brings :)

>Also, the Specs are pretty much like my old upgraded 2006 PC.

Specs don't directly translate to performance. Also, good luck packing your 2006 PC in your backpack and using it without power."
27,Pop-up camera for the people that never take selfies
28,Its not fun tho
29,"Yeah, I'd rather not have motorized parts in my smartphone :D"
30,NOOOOO MY ORANGES
31,Doesn't need to be motorized. Springs work just fine.
32,Is there a smartphone that used this mechanism?
33,"Yes, Vivo has one. I believe Oppo also has one"
34,"I think the Oneplus 7 Pro used it but they didn’t continue it, and went back to hole punch."
35,OnePlus 7 pro
