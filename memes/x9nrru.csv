0,She was the best queen of England in my lifetime
1,Best by what metric?
2,"One of the best pffff! No enemies slain, no battles fought, no Spanish ships sunk, no pillaging of churches, no rumors of usurping the throne and killing your brother and nephews while being physically deformed, I say one of the most boring."
3,"She was very good at pretending to be a normal person, I'll give you that. Don't agree with all the shit about her being down to earth tho. I don't think it's humanly possible for someone in that kind of position/upbringing to be down to earth. Plus she protected pedophiles"
4,"She actually let her guard down in public and was just a lovely old lady, she was the Queen, she was a Royal, but she was also the people, May the Queen Rest in Peace and God Save The King"
5,Duck her
6,Racism i guess
7,"As I said, I'm not a royalist, but that's rude. She didn't originally have to serve the country until her uncle abnigated and her father passed, but she did. And she did a bloody good job of it. She helped out in WW2, taking care of so many and being a person that a lot of people looked up to.
I generally don't agree with the monarchy, but at least I have some sort of respect for people who do because the queen actually served her duty, and did it very well. Such shallow and not very well thought out comments like this are so ignorant."
8,How so?
9,I respect your opinion but she looted my country. I'm an Indian. I can respect her for what she did for her country but never for what she did to mine.
10,Oh I see. Sorry about that. Please include the context for next time.
11,Have a great day!
