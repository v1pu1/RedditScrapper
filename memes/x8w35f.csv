0,My teacher said he grades papers to the Doom soundtrack.
1,Me who study to Mongolian throat singing:
2,But metal is good study music
3,Many types of metal are basically classical music with distorted guitars instead of violins and cellos. Metal bands even do covers of classical songs and they're sick
4,"Actually metal kinda works for focus stuff. It‚Äôs intense and mostly rhythmic, and the lyrics are usually obscured by the vocal techniques used, so you can‚Äôt focus on the words like you can in a catchy pop song. Sure you can hum along to the sick riffs but that‚Äôs not nearly as distracting. It‚Äôs not for everyone but I‚Äôd honestly recommend giving it a try"
5,"I listen to almost exclusively Metal/Hardcore when studying (some hard and punk rock thrown in there as well).

It's a blast lol, I have everything from Black Sabbath, Meshuggah, Iron Maiden, Slaughter to Prevail, Gojira to The Dillinger Escape Plan on my ""Calm tunes to sleep and study time"" playlist."
6,What about the ones that dont study and somehow pass
7,The really scary ones are those who study to music with lyrics you can sing along to
