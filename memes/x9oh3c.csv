1,"seing people not knowing who babe ruth is while learning about him from pawn stars

![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)"
2,Forgot Michael Phelps lol?
3,Where is messi/ronaldo? Usain bolt? I can think of many more bigger athletes..
4,"I mean, have you seen their movies? 

They are convinced that they are the only country in the world"
5,"![gif](giphy|CAYVZA5NRb529kKQUc|downsized)

Me who doesn't give a shit about sports"
6,"Who the fuck is babel Ruth.

Serena isn't even the greatest tennis player of all time.

And like no other country cares about American football"
7,"I‚Äôd put Bo Jackson on that list before Babe Ruth, Tom Brady, or Serena Williams. He might not have been the best in his sports, but he played both Baseball and Football at highly skilled levels. To the point that he is still the only Athlete to be named an All Star in both Baseball and Football."
8,Serena? Ahahaha
9,This is the most american list ever
10,"To be fair, they probably do mean greatest American athletes but since this is on an American tv station they don‚Äôt feel the need to specify."
11,Tiger woods? Michael Schumacher? Messi?
12,"I know we're missing athletes from anywhere else but who the fuck puts a one to five order this way?

And where the absolute fuck is Gretzky, you uncultured fucks?"
13,"Man, no Jon Jones, GSP or Anderson Silva? Smh."
14,Where the fuq is football...? I mean football using foot to kick not only run around the pitch carry the ball
15,"He did defeat the monstars during the space jam.

Its canon."
16,![gif](giphy|d7vbmoGrHfmuc)
17,It annoys me more that the put the list upside down
18,Suiiii
19,And then we win the world series for baseball
20,Bolt Messi Jordan Ali Gretzky and Phelps
21,"Who tf is Babe Ruth? 

Edit: Just googled Tom Brady and I feel a bit dumb thinking he was a wrestler lol"
22,"Mfs get so mad Americans media centers on us, then go on large rants about how were not the center of the universe, and hey were not the center of  **the** universe but it seems we are the center of yours."
23,What's with all the anti American posts on here lately? I've noticed it's become somewhat of a trend.
24,"This isn't an athlete's list, it's more of a champion of their sport. Which tiger woods and Wayne Gretzky should be a part of. 

Of course Tom Brady isn't even close to ever being a top athlete. Ever seen the man run? He's good with his brain. That's about it."
25,"In America the sure I don‚Äôt want to argue. 

But I can name you 5 more greater athletes than all of them. 

1. Serena Williams isn‚Äôt even the greatest tennis player. Djokovic, Nadal and Federer are miles ahead. 

2. Tom Brady. He maybe the best NFL player but he‚Äôs not the greatest athlete in the game where you name the game ‚Äúfootball‚Äù. I‚Äôd argue Messi or Ronaldo are far more superior ‚Äúfootballers‚Äù. And nobody really cares about NFL. You have world championships where only the teams from the US can compete. Ridiculous. 

3. Who the fuck is Babe Ruth? Nobody outside New York cares about Baseball. Closest sport to Baseball is Cricket and billions watch it. If Ruth is there, the Aussie legend Sir Don Bradman should be topping this list. 

4. I will not argue with Mohammad Ali.

Shocked they didn‚Äôt include Tiger Woods."
26,Americans ‚òï
27,Lol Americans do mostly tend to think of America being the centre of the earth.. they only show other countries on the news and in movies to depict a worse life than theirs..
28,"Well, America does produce the best athletes. I mean look at the list"
29,"""I don't think other countries deserve to be in this list"" (/s)"
30,These dudes have a ‚ÄúWorld Series‚Äù that feature American teams only. What did you expect?
31,In reality if you take a look at other athletes from different countries you see they got far more achievements
32,"If they looked outside of their own country, they would be further down the list"
33,American exceptionalism at its best
34,I mean Serena is good but compared to men in tennis she is worse im not sexist thats just facts
35,Well doesn‚Äôt America have the most gold Olympic metals
36,"America produces the best atheletes, yurobum"
37,"Also, Tiger Woods and Wayne Gretski."
38,No top 5 athletes came from this century.
39,"No particular order. Tiger Woods, Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, Ronaldo, and Thor Bj√∂rnsson."
40,"My list in no particular order, and despite me not liking some of those sports:

1.Aleksandr Karelin
2.Ronaldo/Messi (tie)
3.Lennox Lewis
4.George Saint Pierre
5.Usain Bolt

Edit: honourable mentions

1.Gordon Ryan
2.Muhammad Ali
3.Tom Brady
4.Khabib Nurmagomedov
5.Simone Biles
6.Buakaw Banchamek"
41,Babe Ruth isn‚Äôt even the greatest baseball player of HIS time.
42,"Haha funny America jOkEand all but who in their right mind would put Serena in a list of top athletes? She is deffinatly very famous but She isnt even the best at her chosen sport. By her own admission she doesnt hold a candle to the top mens tennis players

My point is that on a purely athletic level, regardless of gender, creed, popularity, and whatever else, there are hundreds of other people who play the game of tennis better than her"
43,"At their sport:

1. Michael Jordan
2. Muhammad Ali
3. Usain Bolt
4. Lionel Messi
5. Cristiano Ronaldo

Physically (all areas):

1. Lebron James
2. Giannis Antetokounmpo
3. Mike Tyson
4. Muhammad Ali
5. Michael Phelps

Just my opinion on top 5 greatest athletes"
44,"And where I live they do same thing just with locals all the time, what's your point?

Objectivity died long ago. At least these are bit known, so maybe that's why it's not as annoying to me"
45,"Top 5 greatest athletes of all time of America, would be more correct."
46,Even Jordan would not have made it on a top 5 all time let's be real
47,Where are lindan and lee chong wei?
48,"No, of course....but Michael Jordan:D"
49,Even if it‚Äôs an American only list where is Michael Phelps??
50,What‚Äôs up with Serena Williams? She wouldn‚Äôt even be top 10 in tennis
51,Ngl those athletes do deserve a spot tho
52,"Maybe it was only broadcasted in the US, so it made sense to only use regional list? A possibility. I have no idea if that‚Äôs true or what."
53,That‚Äôs because it is.
54,That guys chin tho
55,Stay mad
56,I only know the number one and two. Who the fuck is the rest?
57,"Where is kipchoge?
And Bolt"
58,Sachin Tendulkar? This is the exactly the reason why terrorists hates America
59,It's better this way. Things don't go well when they start noticing other countries
60,"Here's my list....

1. Michael Jordan
2. Tiger Woods
3. Wayne Gretzky
4. Michael Phelps
5. Toss up between Joe Lewis and Muhammad Ali"
61,what mf named serena williams looks like eggman :skull:
62,Messi and  Ronaldo have left the chat
63,Bro Serena ain‚Äôt even in the top 10k tf
64,Those aren't even the greatest athletes in the US lol. Needs more Bo Jackson and Michael Phelps.
65,"Jordan? Sure, makes sense

Ali? Yeah, I can see it, 

Ruth? Why not? Baseball‚Äôs a decently sized sport that I can see him being included

Brady? I say this as an American, nobody else gives a shit about American Football

Serena? Didn‚Äôt she just flat out say she‚Äôd get obliterated if she tried competing with men? Or am I getting her confused with another tennis player?

Either way, Wayne Gretzky should be here if baseball was considered big enough to be included. Phelps and Bolt too"
66,"Maradona, Pele, Olga Korbut these are legends"
67,Damn country is barely two-fiddy years old and they thinking the're the only ones in the world. God help us all
68,*Virat Kohli has entered the chat*
69,Well they did give the world Lance Armstrong. He could appear on several worlds greatest lists.
70,I sometimes hate being American just because of how often  all we sane Americans get grouped together with the Karen Americans.
71,Pulisic 1.5 ofc
72,"Wayne Gretzky gets no respect, man."
73,Not a single athlete from the worlds number one most favorite sport. That‚Äôs odd.
74,At least Serena and Ali compete(d) internationally.
75,They definitely act like it's the only country that matters.
76,"I'd say #5 Lionel Messi
#4 Tom brady
#3 Christians Ronaldo (idk if Messi or Ronaldo is better)
#2 Micheal Jordan 
#1 Usain bolt"
77,All of these people are on the list for their specific sport. But MJ and Ali are definitely there on the greatest athletes list. There is no question that Ali was the greatest of all time in boxing.
78,Forget about Heather McKay
79,How is Floyd Mayweather not on that list? and yes countless other non-America athletes.
80,"Trust me, no one in America thinks this list is accurate. Even if it was top 5 American athletes."
81,Wayne Gretzky ?
82,Sachin Tendulkar
83,Why does this exist? Right? I guess that should be a question.... But a better would be why do we care about this existing? I didn't even know this shit existed until I saw this.
84,I like MJ‚Ä¶.but Ali was fighting mofos. Put the Greatest at number 1
85,Typical inward thinking yanks. ü§¢ü§Æ
86,"I don't care about foreign sport stars because I don't watch cricket or soccer (sorry, football)"
87,"Serena even in her prime couldn‚Äôt beat any man on the tennis tour. So how could she be a top 5 athlete of all time ?  Haven‚Äôt we learned anything from that alphabet swimmer at Penn. before he decided to wear dresses he was ranked like 628 as a man. Once he put a dress on and fucked with liberals minds there wasn‚Äôt a girl who could beat him, I mean her, I mean him her.  Get it now?"
88,Where‚Äôs Mahatma Gandhi? That man was balling
89,"Should be Top 5 greatest at their sport. 
Because Tom Brady is one of the least athletic QBs in the league but he‚Äôs the best at his position of all time"
90,Top 5 *American* athletes
91,The fact that people dont know who Babe Ruth is is honestly sad
92,When the American list made by an American for Americans gets posted online just for a bunch of people to throw shit at the wall and ask who Babe Ruth is.
93,Well USA rebuild eu after WW2 . USA give technology to Russia and china . So USA is beneficiary of the east world .  .
94,Serena williams really?
95,"As a swede I must bow down and ask ‚ÄùWhere are Ole Einar Bj√∏rndalen och Marit Bj√∏rgen?""."
96,Some people need to Google Jonah Lomu
97,Why does Serena Williams look like Dr. Eggman?
98,Is 5's photo eggman?
99,"Ok I know she‚Äôs a controversial figure, but any top X list of American athletes that doesn‚Äôt have Caitlyn (n√©e Bruce) Jenner is definitely not thought through."
100,It‚Äôs a list of American athletes‚Ä¶In America‚Ä¶.On American television. Stop trying to get karma from America haters.
