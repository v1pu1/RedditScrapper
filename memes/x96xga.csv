7,"My tip is that you should drop the meme in community that specifically caters to your topic and doesn't have Queen Elizabeth memes dominating the front page. After a couple of days, repost your meme here..."
8,Itâ€™s always the ones youâ€™ve been working on for a while too
9,I'm kinda interested with your memes now. Will you let me have a little look pls?
10,Yeah anything that isnâ€™t QE gets an upvote from me
