3,"That's nice and all but that doesn't change the fact that there are 49 million kangaroos in australia and only 350,000 people in iceland which means that if the kangaroos were to invade iceland each person would have to fight 140 kangaroos"

5,"Wires got crossed when I was about three

Dad had bloody heavy hands, used them on me

My mamma? 

Bless her heart, 'cause she gave me a start

She got killed, bad man, dad stiffed in a scam

Grew up in the system, bounced, couple homes

This woman Mary, gifted me hand-me-down clothes

Shy at the start, till this guy named Shifty

Who had 100 pounds on me called me Brittle Bones Nicky

A target aimed straight at my face

Big house of kids, cred is cake

Rounded up a couple bucks, got it freshly baked

Sat down to dinner

Put it right in his face

Right in his fucking face..."

22,"IN HIS FACE

You're not gonna push me around 

You can't take me down down down

You're not gonna push me around 

You can't take me down down down 

Bounce ahead a couple years King of my peers

We biked the block cheers and pretty girls beers

Did alright for myself Petty thefts I pulled 

Dropped out of school built a circle of bulls 

Needing more money covered head to toe

Snuck up... sucker took his stash and drove 

The cash stashed it was pouring in 

bulk of it up my nose

How dumb I was twenty-one and way out of control

The cops kicked down the door 

She did a line right off my WOAH

Said ""that's one way to go down""

Knew I was hard as rock 

Knew I. Was. Hard. As. Rock."
