You won't meet anyone in the afterlife. Your soul will be suspended in neverending bliss of god's presence. You won't even remember your past life. You will be stuck in the lobby forever. Nothing more. No creative mode, no boobs, no jumping from one cloud onto another, while completely buttnaked. Honestly, it kinda sucks.

Essentially your reward for being a good human is to be a fuel for the Golden Throne.

If you want to respawn, you'd better choose one of the Asian religions. But there's a 99,9% chance you will end up as nothing more but a beetle and roll a turd for the rest of your short bug life. The choice is yours."
