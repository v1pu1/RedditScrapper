2,"As an American I can proudly say
I don‚Äôt give a shit"
3,üôÑ
4,Do y‚Äôall really think Americans care
5,I‚Äôve never seen a single American upset over this
6,As an American it‚Äôs kind of a relief lol
7,"Finally not the center of attention, I can finally get some rest."
8,Can tell this wasn‚Äôt made by an American cause it‚Äôs honestly nice to not be in the news lol
9,Sad that a world leader passes and people still think about what Americans are doing
10,Bro forgot about Ukraine
11,"actually it‚Äôs kinda nice, the ‚Äúamerica bad‚Äù memes are getting pretty boring at this point"
12,"Every single American ""Why is the world so fucking obsessed with us?""

The moment the media looks at anything else ""I bet Americans are mad we aren't stalking them RN"""
13,"I don't think that Americans give a fuck, neither does the world."
14,We aren't angry we are quite the opposite actually.
15,Americans right now are also sad the queen died

23,As a American I rebuke the thought of not being the center of attention.
24,I'm American and tbh I don't give a shit if the US is all over it or not at all and I think it is respectful to focus on the UK anyways because the US is way to much over the internet
25,"/) Until the MIB erase this from everyone's memory and replace her with a new clone again, that is."

90,I know I do
91,"For me at least, there‚Äôs probably some that are like the meme though"
92,"I gotta be honest I understand why people think Americans are self centered but I see people in my own circle think the same way about Europeans, obviously I can't speak for Canadians or Mexicans or the rest of the united states outside of the 5 people I talk to on the regular basis. But I really wish there were more people who acknowledge our cultural differences and understand we are not always going to be on the same track when it comes to solving our problems."
