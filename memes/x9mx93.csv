1,Leap day should be an official holiday with parties and no work
2,"13 months with 28 days each, so it's 4 weeks in each month. We just have to make 1 (2 on leap years) holiday which is not considered a day in a month. Maybe it should be either the last or first day of the year, for the new year celebration. No more 31/30 days confusion, no more shifting of days of the week."
3,8 is this Good Will Hunting?
4,First picture. You'll need to be Pontifus Maximus to make this change.
5,"If we had 13 months in a year, every month could be exactly the same length with exactly 4 weeks each month. The only exception being the last week of the year only has 6 days, save for leap years when it would have the same as all the others"
6,Halloween 2: Electric boogaloo
7,A 2 day Halloween sounds pretty great actually
8,That’s when the purge happens
9,How would birthdays work? If i was born on the 31st of the month do i not celebrate anymore? There’d be no bdays in the 13th month for a while

11,last week would have 8 or 9 days. 13\*28=364
12,"Just map your old birthday to a new calendar, if it's the 29th of January it will move to the 1st of February, and so on. Just count what day it is from the start of the year on the old calendar, and see what date it is on a new one, so basically, all people who are born after the 28th of January will get a new b-day date."
13,"It's nice because we are all used to it, but the quarter being 3 new months and 1 week (13 weeks) is as arbitrary as 3 months right now. It maybe even be arguably better, since new quarters will have the same amount of days (91 91 91 91) instead of (90/91, 91, 92, 92).
But that's for a ""quick"" fix of what we have right now, I'm pretty sure that if you ask some bored mathematician they will find you dozens of ways to split our years into better pieces)"
14,1 (2) leftover days should be New Year's celebration
15,"This is a pretty well thought out system, but unfortunately it will never happen"
16,"Yeah, unfortunately, we need some kind of well-respected worldwide organization or a few of the largest countries' leaders to agree to change something like this. But it is still fun to think about how would you change some poorly designed systems from the past)"
