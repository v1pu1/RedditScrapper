1,Imagine in a few years kids having to learn about all the crazy shit Florida people did
2,Don't get your hopes up that high for humanity. Leave the bar low enough
3,"I think that humans, in general, want to be good. The reason history is so full of bad people doing bad things is because (in my uneducated opinion,) the people who are average and good won't make such a strong impression in books, as well as the fact that power corrupts. Sometimes people can also be misguided, and what they think is good or the right thing is, in actuality not."
4,"Power corrupts. Humans, with our negativity bias born from our roots in a dangerous wild world, tend to focus too much on that corruption. Humans are inherently good, it's the ones corrupted by power that are evil, and that evil is focused on too much by textbooks. Not enough attention is put on the good, like when Britain not only outlawed slavery across its empire, but proceeded to launch a very expensive military blockade of Africa to stop the trans-atlantic slave trade. Britain only in the last few years finished paying off the debt that campaign caused them."
