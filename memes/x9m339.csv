0,"Totem of undying is a mine raft item. If you hold one, you are saved from death one time.

People are saying the Queen wasn't holding one, or ran out of them etc, and that is why she finally died"
1,"Before the queens death, there were jokes about how she never died because she had been queen since 1952, survived the pandemic and a lot of life threatening things. Totems of undying come from minecraft and if you hold it in your off hand it will stop you from dying when you usually would. The joke was the queen had an unlimited amount of totems of undying so she was immortal basically.
Joke was she ran out or forget to put it in her off hand"
