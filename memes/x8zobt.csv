If one of the dominant tech giants keeps making the same phones with few improvements and charging exorbitant amounts, why must I be forced to buy one in order to lament the direction the smartphone market is headed? 

Are you gatekeeping criticism? Is that what this is?

I'm not worried that a phone I'm never gonna buy is bad, I'm worried that if Apple keeps getting away with this that soon everyone else will be trying to do it too. Samsung has already just become diet apple, what's to stop other companies from doing the same?"
