0,She doesn't need a driving license because driving licenses are issued by the Queen. So if she ever needs to produce a driver's license she can just sign a piece of paper saying she has one.
1,"“Was allowed to drive without her license” 
I’m pretty sure she was allowed to do many many things that break the law, especially small ones, because who the fuck would have the balls to arrest Queen Elizabeth II"
2,"She is not the longest reigning monarch ever, it's Louis XIV king of France... She is just the longest reigning monarch of England and the Commonwealth."

45,"Now make this ""meme"" but about Betty White, a real Chad."

60,Are brits really that brainwashed that they actually like the royal family ? I thought it was a joke. We're in fucking 2022 and people still enjoy having the most fucking parasitic class in their society.
61,Didn't King Louis XIV have a reign that lasted a bit longer than her?

66,"Imagine supporting this POS enough to make a meme in her honour. 

She wasn't an innocent, cute old lady, she was the head of a nation that was involved in so many conflicts and wars, that exploited and killed many millions. If you want to excuse that and put it all on other people, like politicians, then what about the time she saved her rapist son from facing the punishment he deserved and denying the justice his victim(s) deserved?

Memes are often silly but, OP, this meme was so shortsighted"

82,And we forget what she has done to Iran or any other British puppets
83,She also paid a heap of money to keep her peado son out of jail. Well done Liz
84,"All this talk about her colonizing, human rights violations and refusing to return national treasures but did she do any of that tho? 

Could constitutional British monarchs have even done anything close to the likes of absolutist French kings and russian tsars? I thought it was parliament that ran the show since somewhere after Cromwell? That British monarchs are mere figureheads with little to no political power? Didn’t Elizabeth ii come to rule in 1952, well after the disintegration of the British colonial empire?"
